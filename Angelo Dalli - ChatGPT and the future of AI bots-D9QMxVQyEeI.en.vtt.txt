 Solutions and join our smart thinking  and Angela Dali welcome back to the  podcast you were one of the original  guests here podcast number five I  believe and now you're here again how  are you doing today I'm doing great and  happy to be back here on the podcast  and Angela actually you told me after  the podcast we recorded last time that  you were recording that episode without  any plans so I want to start today by  asking what's the pound situation today  because I want to see it I do okay sorry  all right  it's two years it's a kind of brought to  maturity and this is well I like it uh  well it's great to have you here Angelo  first of all and um you're obviously the  CEO of ubnae uh you're probably the  person with the broadest AI experience  and the expertise that also have a kind  of a background in the eye giving  industry and that is why we're here  today which is to talk about chat GPT  um and um and kind of the news that it's  caused in the last couple of weeks and  um what we think can be the result of  these type of chatbots as we go into  kind of the the near and Midterm future  so I suppose my first question is  um a quite direct and Frank question  because there's been a lot of  speculation on if chargpt can even be so  disruptive that it's uh threatens Google  search and so I want to just go into  that question first of all do you think  chat TPT is a threat to Google and if so  why  I think this is a very interesting  question and uh just a few days ago for  Google have been doing this code red  um  checking out why and how you know it can  actually affect Google I mean it's an  obvious thing to think about you know  and uh when you see in Sci-Fi movies  that you ask something to a computer and  the computer just tells you a complete  answer rather than just you know web  pages and stuff like Google does and uh  when you think about it chat GPT is  becoming closer and closer to that and  so it is an obvious way of enhancing  search engine results and giving you  information in the future  um I don't think that chat GPT is yet a  threat to Google uh mostly because the  way the chat GPT works it is something  called the language model and language  models just predict what the next word  should be so given a question they try  to see what are the sentences that they  need to form and also have some kind of  memory and builds jet GPT the main  difference between it and other language  models is that it has a memory of what  it has been asked by you in that session  but it doesn't check facts so you know  Google does actually check facts because  it goes to the internet indexes it tries  to see you know how many if there are  conflicting information it tries to  apply some kind of filtering to that it  doesn't always work of course it can  still give you fake news and fake  misinformation  um with Google but there is much lower  chance of Google giving you bad  information misinformation then chat  typically does  right right I suppose it's kind of like  the margin of error in Google is much  lower than chat GPT that is kind of  giving you one answer and it is just  kind of hoping that it is the right  answer so to say but it it often spits  out answers that are just actually not  correct so far right but do you think  that will improve by time  I think this may be this may improve but  not with the current technology that GPT  um is based on so basically GPT which  stands for generative pre-trained  Transformer  um P3 and Transformer basically what it  does is that it has a very very  sophisticated pattern generator it  matches the input and tries to predict  something that makes sense based on that  input but it doesn't actually understand  what is going on and so this is a very  important distinction that even though  Google doesn't always understand what is  going on it has many more models that  are still understand the intent of what  users are searching for so tries to get  contextual relevant answers and it's a  search engine  um while churchipity is designed to be  more like a conversational engine so  they are related together and I'm sure  like someone is gonna at some point  bring these two together but uh chat  Jeopardy isn't there yet  fair enough fair enough and I mean  Google is generating 200 plus billion  dollar in arts Revenue each year and as  you pointed out here it has been these  kind of leaked documents from Google  where they feel threatened internally  from uh chat gbt but obviously uh I  would assume that this announcement  doesn't come as a surprise to Google  obviously open AI have developed their  GPT models for for quite a long time and  you would assume as well behind the  doors in Google that they would also  have been developing similar models  although maybe they haven't announced  them yet so you would assume at some  point that Google would kind of counter  with their own products at some point  definitely definitely in fact you may  have seen the recent controversy a few  months ago  um where one of the Google Engineers  working with a prototype chatbot that  Google had made  um was saying ah this chatbot is  sentient you know and uh you know even  filing a lawsuit against Google that  didn't end very well I think he got  fired from Google  um and it is a little bit ridiculous in  a way that uh you know that all these  claims of sentience because it's  literally like asking  imagine you have a very intelligent  period a very intelligent one one who  constantly reads and reads the entire  internet of course they're going to be  able to pay it back very interesting and  why is sounding quotes back to you but  that is basically what chat TPT is doing  there is no understanding so  um ascribing and we as humans have this  tendency to anthropomorphize everything  to ascribe human qualities to machines  to programs and this is how we think and  because the output of jgbt is so good I  mean you have to admit it's it's really  really good and I think I've seen  language models evolve over the last 20  years  um and to the point where now you can  actually believe  um the text that they say and the  quality of the text is quite good even  of images with related stuff  um so I think that we are at the verge  of you know that Plateau that Valley in  between kind of The Uncanny Valley but  of text in which we have text that is  good enough that you can literally copy  and paste and maybe use as a starter  point to write an article to write ad  copy or maybe give it free written ad  copy and tell it you know give it a few  variants write a few variants on this  text and I think the output is good  enough to fool most people into thinking  that a person has actually written it  but it's not good enough yet to rely on  so it's kind of in that awkward teenage  phase  it's an awkward AI teenager essentially  it doesn't cross the across the face yet  because that's also um another  interesting point that you mentioned  kind of uncanny valley and um the turian  test uh which is uh kind of kind of  machine trick you that it is that it is  human and um I suppose that to some  extent the chargpt on a lower level is  passing the the turian test now because  some of the answers that it that it  gives you is I mean definitely the way  in the way it interprets what you're  saying is this such a big step that it  comes across from a Layman's perspective  um or have you seen kind of is has this  been kind of progression unnatural there  has been a progression there has been  I've been working with language models  for literally like 20 years and the  original the original models which were  mostly focused on search engines  um were pretty primitive I mean and I  think what has made the enablement of  these language models is this thing  called the Transformer architecture  which has been around for just a few  years it's not that old uh and GPT was  one of the main first large-scale  applications of that and we're seeing  very fast progress It's not like this  thing has been around for like 20 years  I mean Transformers have been mainstream  for maybe like five years or so and  we've made big leaps in quality and I  can see that yes right now Chad Deputy  is in the upper teenage phase but it  will eventually graduate and become you  know more adult more mature and we can  actually use it for more and more  interesting stuff so I can see the  progress from having something that kind  of fails off and maybe that you can use  only little I don't know generate like a  few variants in a a b test so something  that can actually pass or almost pause  the Turing test I think that there are  flaws with the Turing test  at the end the Turing test was conceived  in the 50s when AI wasn't mainstream at  all that was the beginning of AI and I  think that this is something that needs  to be supplemented because we are  rapidly realizing that having something  that can produce a convincing sounding  answer but which is effectually  incorrect is not really the measure by  which we measure intelligence so I think  this is something that will also Force  how do we test AI how do we determine  how intelligent AI is right right and if  you were if you look at chat TPT today  and its functionality what would you say  are the most interesting use cases for  the chatbots today  in your opinion oh definitely there are  so many so so many applications some of  which I've been also working on for  example is how to attach the effect  checking together with the language  models how do you figure that out so  there is this new type of AI called the  neural symbolic AI that is coming onto  the stage in the world which combines  the neural networks the Deep learning  techniques together with the way that we  speak which is in terms of symbols in  terms of words in terms of logic and by  combining these two it's called neural  symbolic AI this gives you the best of  both words it gives you all the niceties  of being able to generate text that  looks nice that looks good that is  plausible that it could have been  generated by a person yet with all the  fact checking capabilities so the  applications are endless and obviously  relevant to a wide different variety of  Industries including gaming but also  others for example in customer service  being able to have you know that's the  obvious one obviously having a chatbot  that handles customer service complaints  but or you know just talks to people  um I think that if you've used  changipity  um for a while you realize the the  replies that it gives you are pretty  good and I think they are a step ahead  as in quality than most chatbot  technologies that have been around so I  think that is one of the main things um  education  um you know I can envisage the chat GPT  being used in simple educational  thoughts I think that is also something  else where these Technologies are gonna  help grading things helping you write  better for example this kind of stuff  um also the content generation obviously  this is something where I think a lot of  advertisers from next year are going to  be using chargeivity and just not saying  anything about it  um I'm pretty sure I know some friends  who have been writing books using  chegjipity and you know they do edit it  and I had done this I had written also  an article a news article about this and  it was published and you know we did  disclose that I had used GPT for this  and it was actually pretty good and I  had edited it very very lightly so I can  see how this is going to continue and  we're gonna end up you know just putting  in keywords and editing maybe our job as  content creators is going to be just  editing stuff in the future  um also I think when it comes to  language translation I think translation  is going to improve even better because  sometimes the way translation Works  um does not take into account the  nuances of stuff so I think that by  having a chatbot that can actually then  take the initial translation and maybe  make it seem better I think that would  be very important and I think also you  know the office like personal assistance  um I'd love to have charge GPT reply to  most of my emails for example actually  there's uh have you seen this Angela it  is the other week there was on an app  that was released that's called  Ellie it's uh it's on it's on it's  plugged into open ai's API and um  basically it answers emails for you  using using GPT have you seen that yeah  so so yes and and social media messages  you know when you get also messages on  different platforms  um I think this is gonna be one of the  main uses for people who are busy  actually and still can't deal with the  flow yeah yeah that's an interesting  Theory so so  um our dear friend Chris Grove he talked  about how do you get to cro inbox the  the Sierra import Paradox and  um so the Sierra inbox Paradox is funny  because uh you know it's uh as  professionals it's like you're chasing  the dragon all the time to get to an  inbox that doesn't have any unopened  emails and um the Paradox is says that  the more emails you reply to the more  unread emails you will have because  trying to get to see our email by this  replying to emails it leads to more  replies back essentially yeah and so the  way to get the cro inbox is to not reply  to emails that's the Paradox and and so  we asked the question I'm like so what  about  um what about La this um new email uh  the AI up will it lead to Sierra inbox  or will it lead to infinite inbox  because if um if the AI started emailing  each other you would imagine you would  imagine that all of a sudden you will  get unlimited like uh infinite emails  instead of getting to see our inbox we  may also end up with AI you know like my  AI is replying to your AI and your AI is  replying back and they're just carrying  out conversations on our behalf and God  knows what they're gonna decide so you  know if all of a sudden have your home  mortgage off without your knowledge  um that those situations may happen if  we don't have proper control and you  know I I don't I have never achieved  zero inbox unfortunately myself  um with or without the help of AI and uh  I just like chasing it under the rainbow  yeah yeah it's uh basically I just gave  up on it  um and I have followed the strategy that  you've mentioned of uh maybe not being  so responsive uh on on emails um but the  thing is that yes it is an elusive dream  and I do admire people who manage to  reach that stage I have never managed to  do it consistently  um but I can see how AI can help you  focus on things that really need your  attention because let's face it a lot of  emails that you get are things that you  can either delegate to someone or that  are not so relevant and you know maybe  the personal ones then you do answer and  it will actually claw back time that  you've spent just reading stuff and  classifying them because I think most of  the the reason why people do not  actually reply is not really that they  don't want to reply it's just it takes  too much effort to actually go through  them so by having some something that  prioritizes it and maybe it just does a  little bit of the gradually for you for  things that are not so important that  they need your personal attention then  gives you more time for those things  that do need or that you do want to give  personal attention and this is the whole  promise of AI  um of being able to be a tool that  enhances society that gives us a better  life that gives us more time to pursue  things that are more productive to Percy  things that we want to do rather than  you know maybe items that are not and  tasks that are not really  um so useful and so value-added  yeah it's an interesting argument on the  I suppose the other side of that  argument is technology in the last 50  years and the rise of computers also  brought this promise of being able to do  tours for us which we don't enable us to  have more time for ourselves and so on  um but it seems to me that whenever  technology gives us a tool it increases  our productivity but there's always an  unlimited amount of tasks so while it's  kind of does some work it also presents  the opportunity then to do other tasks  as well and I would imagine if you  compare like a professional of today  with a professional in the 50s that the  amount of output that you have today as  a professional you know you you can  correspond a hundred times back and  forth via email rather than having to  send a letter and wait for the reply and  then reply back and so on I would  imagine that the um the output of work  has used like totally exploded in this  lost like 70 years whereas actually we  are still working you know 9 10 11 12  hours a day yeah and I wonder if um if  the AI tools will just spur on the fact  that we will be able to just create more  and more work actually I think so I  think that will it will enable us to  create more work to do more output there  is actually a downside to this is that  at some point you know if you remove  certain work you're going to actually  have people that don't have anything to  do so there is kind of this dark side  that is a very present in all these  debates  um will AI replace what jobs is it going  to replace and unfortunately even though  um you know me and a lot of other AI  experts share this Vision that AI should  replace people not replace people but  actually replace the work that you know  that they do that is not worth it  um and help people basically in  achieving things that they want to do  and at some point you know there is only  so much stuff that is available for  people to do  um so we're kind of neat I think to  figure out  um how to avoid AI replacing people  basically how to and there will be this  inevitability that AI will replace some  classes of jobs and then the question  would be how do you actually give enough  training to people to be able to do this  you know to have a career to be able to  cope with the future basically without  being able to do nothing  um I think that the productivity of  people isn't on the increase but I think  there is at some point where we do need  to have control we do need to provide  input  um but I think that is where there will  always be a bottleneck which is us  um in getting things done and maybe it's  not so bad maybe it's not so bad at all  I mean it's not bad to actually be able  to enjoy ourselves either it's like yeah  doesn't it feel like to make sound that  we are heading towards going full circle  with this whole computer and internet  age where at the beginning humans build  computers and we interact with computers  to to do tests but as we as we go  further into the future eventually  computers will communicate with each  other and as you mentioned human beings  are just going to be a bottleneck at  some point it doesn't feel like we're  going full like towards a point where we  have gone full circle  it it does it does indeed and again I  argue that maybe this bottleneck is not  such a bad thing  um that maybe there is virtue and being  able to say okay  um there is a limit to how fast you can  go that people can actually catch up  um I think there are some things some  classes of thoughts that it is great to  have ai working on them for example I  don't know if you are doing some  research in which you know the AI has to  match I don't know known medical  compounds against diseases I think that  is something where AI excels at  automating that and maybe we don't want  actually people to do that are just  guided and just let it do you know all  the hard work of trying things out  um even in doing campaign management you  can try different techniques and  campaigns and see what works what  doesn't work  um I think that is where AI is like  really perfect to do that and it's going  to increase the output  um when it comes to creativity even  though there are a lot of tools now even  for example like with the stability  diffusion models and images which are  kind of the image analog of charge GPT  I think it is going to be increasing the  productivity and I already have already  friends who are using this to sketch  things quickly to produce stuff that is  pretty good actually very quickly  um but I still think that there is that  orchestration that element of control of  creativity that people will be always  leading it so I think it's basically  providing a very sophisticated tool in  the hands of people who use it but as as  always I mean if I give if you give me a  you know edges it in my hand at the face  of Marvel and you give it to  Michelangelo  um you know we're going to end up with  very different results so it's also the  skillet at how you use the the tool yeah  yeah exactly I I thought it was funny um  how people interact with chapter UTP for  the first time and so in our team for  example we have Martin our salesperson  he tried to command the the chatbot to  create a good sales pitch for our  product okay that's what his first  command and then we have a for example  me I asked the the app to to create a  love poem about the agony industry you  know and uh okay and then finally our  managing editor he asked chatty to P if  it will take him take his job away from  him right so okay it's another it's an  editor he was scared that is uh this is  going to impact his livelihood obviously  it's funny how we all have different  perspectives on exactly on the chatbots  yeah uh but I suppose as well um another  another  perspective here Angelo is um  in order to to get the most out of ciao  GPT you really need to know what type of  questions you can ask get them like what  is the capabilities of this AI both  undone it made me think a bit that you  know me as a Layman I am getting not  even one percent out of the capability  of GPT I just don't know exactly what to  what extent it can help me in my daily  in my daily job and and to our company  um however there would be individuals  like yourself for example who is an  expert on these type of language models  who would know perfectly well how to  write commands and prompts for  chatibility to maximize its output so to  say and doesn't this like create a new  field of professionals like a kind of  like prompt experts or something like  that that a company like us at like even  next we should be able to hire and a  chat PPT consultant who can tell us like  okay these are like 10 use cases that  you guys can use chat GPT for here are  like some ready-made prompts that you  can put into the  um to the app every time you need to  produce whatever you need to produce and  so on isn't this opening a new field of  work oh yeah definitely definitely I I  like prompt engineer or something like  that um  definitely um in fact I've seen it I've  seen for example I've been helping  artists generate better art  um using tools like Dali like stability  like mid-journey  um and they frequently ask me actually  okay how do I get the better results and  some of the stuff is obvious but some of  it is not obvious at all for example an  interesting example would be like if you  add trending on Art station in in  mid-journey you get better results it's  not an obvious thing at all but yeah if  you add that to the to the end of the  prompt you get better results so  um I think that in fact there are people  who are creating tools that let you type  in a normal kind of everyday prompt and  it enhances it for you so we're already  seeing this kind of tools on the market  and as I said it's kind of the ability  to use a tool then will depend there  will always the experts that are real  experts at using a tool and chatgpt and  also the image generators are just very  Advanced tools so you'll always get the  you know entry level and then you'll get  the expert level and you know the nice  thing about it is that you do not need  to go and do a PhD to become an expert  at this it actually takes a lot of  practice and tinkering around and  finding what what works what doesn't  work an interesting thing is that the  creators of the tools for example open  AI themselves and also the creators of  the of stability diffusion and other  models do not actually know all the  prompts that relate to high quality  stuff so there is that element of  exploration at the moment it's like you  know the gold mining how how to find the  best patterns that actually work and I  find it fascinating that the creators  themselves do not know exactly what's  going to lead to a really astoundingly  good output and not so uh yeah I see  that there will be a lot of  opportunities in the future to build  Fantastic Tools actually around us  absolutely can we speculate a bit around  this Angela so I've been thinking a lot  about what these type of air tools  what's kind of the next logical step I  think it seems to be developing is such  a quick Pace that it's going to be just  very difficult to predict kind of the  long term output of this but but in the  very short term something that I was  thinking about is um since it can  already produce code for example  um isn't the next logical step for  example if you want to develop a website  rather than going to a agency with a  brief continue in the near future  produce the same brief to the uh to the  to the AI both and it will build you a  website for example which you can then  iterate with the next command for  example doesn't that seem to be the next  step here and would that wouldn't output  all the web agencies of the business  overnight Wireless  well definitely actually I mean you can  already do that with some of the tools  you can already create websites um if  you write the prompt in a correct way  you can actually get websites like  output already  um and in fact there's someone who even  managed to get a like a prompt within a  prompt  um in chat GPT  um to tell it basically create like a  Linux system as the output and they  actually managed to create like a little  computer system within Chad GPT it was  you know like watching Inception  basically a Dream Within A Dream this  was like a an AI within an AI kind of  thing um and this is very interesting  Andreas is a lot of questions  um because then you got weird things  like for example the date and time  inside this imaginary computer was not  actually  um the present time so it was an imagine  time and you realize that it is making  things up  um as it goes along so uh you know but I  think for things like website design  definitely definitely I mean especially  given that there are a lot of templates  out there and let's face it a lot of  people actually start off nowadays from  ready-made templates and then customize  those templates for websites so it's not  much of a task to actually take those  pre-made templates train an AI on it and  just tell it you know to customize it  according to what you need so I do think  that is one area where  um yeah website designers are gonna be  maybe more efficient in producing a  website and maybe it will lower  hopefully the cost for consumers to do  that  um also when it comes to social media  content and updating like to put little  variants that are optimized for  different social media networks I think  that's where AI is going to constantly  do this I mean you've seen the avatars  um everyone is doing this AI avatars  um imagine being able to tell a whole  story and to generate a video of it I've  seen something recently about this  Finnish photographer who was actually  training a custom-made AI on photos of a  model and then being able to create  different scenes in which the person is  actually inside that particular scene so  you'll be able to do one photo shoot in  which they take photos of you in  different angles different expressions  and then it will be able to generate as  many photos in whatever context you want  to do and I think this is going to be  like you know the photo shoot of the  future if you have the images that you  already like  um just generate whatever you like  um in different backgrounds different  scenarios in different poses  um I think it's going to be something  that's gonna be commonplace actually  obviously as time goes why then you will  need to update the update those photos  unless you want to be lazy and also you  know age them a little bit also with AI  and when you think about it I even see  entire films being made in the future  getting you know they people have  already done this  um in which they get even actors that  are not not even no longer with us and  kind of resurrect them and put them in  films  um it's like fantasy football but you  know apply to creative content  um you'd say okay wow if I want to see  Marin Monroe with uh you know in a  present-day film for example you'd be  able to do that  um and this raises a lot of questions  um who owns those images what about the  copyright issues  um who will actually be the creator of  such content is it for example if you  are using  um those systems to create that would it  be peer as the creator of the AI  um there are all these issues that I  think are not completely resolved  exactly it's interesting and to go back  a bit you mentioned uh this kind of  inception like quality of chat GPT to to  create a system on AI within the AI and  um this happened with Minecraft as well  I believe that someone built a computer  in Minecraft that can run Minecraft in  in the software basically yeah and um I  don't know if you're aware of Nick  Bostrom and you know I'm going to go on  a little bit of a Tanja here right yeah  so so Nick bothstrom he's a Swedish  philosopher who is deep into  uh philosophy philosophy  um around if we are living in a  simulation and uh so an exposure theory  is that if like if we ever managed to  create a simulation of the universe it  means that we by almost certainty  ourselves live in a simulation because  if you can create the simulation of the  universe then eventually that simulation  will create another simulation which  will create another simulation which  will create a lot of simulation which  means that we are probably in the middle  of these layers of simulations at some  point so maybe maybe the um GPT is the  first step here to create that  simulation possibly and uh you know it's  an interesting question I think it has  been asked since the time of the Greeks  I think one of the best films and  explains it is the Matrix actually which  is one of my favorites because  um in reality it is explaining this  philosophical Concept in fact there is  this underlying philosophy  um in The Matrix this is actually  exactly that how the this field  um and you know one of my favorite  animated series Rick and Morty actually  a few I don't know if you see all right  Rick and Morty yes I covered it many  times you know when you have a  university in the universe and they're  like trying to get energy by just  creating a little Universe of people  um who's so function is to just produce  energy for you know Rick and Morty to  use  um and uh you know it this thing sounds  very very Fantastical but there is no  way to actually approve or disprove it  yet  um I do have my own kind of uh feeling  about this  um just because to be able to do a  complete simulation of the universe you  need to have a Quanto simulator and  actually be able to model quantum  physics on that so we do need to have a  complete Quantum processor to do that in  fact this was one of the original  motivations why we have Quantum  processing in the first place to be able  to simulate the the universe and the  laws of physics which are which we know  are ones we don't know the exact rules  yet  um and be able to simulate it at a very  very high level of fidelity whether  we'll manage to do that or not it's  still up for questions  um the only thing that you know this  argument sometimes bring about is that  they don't consider the amount of energy  that you actually need to create the  simulations so I think there is a limit  to how many of the stuff you can do the  levels you know the levels like  Inception because each level needs quite  a lot of processing power you'd need  quite a lot of energy so I'm not sure  that it can be possible to have very  extreme extent I don't think that they  reckon more the scenarios are actually  ever gonna happen for example  um wouldn't be on the way to do allow a  lower energy simulation be to generate a  kind of low resolution version of the  universe where  in in the local view it is seen as a  high resolution but uh from far away  it's a rendered as a low resolution  video kind of like how video games work  where the video games aren't um  rendering every detail of the map in  high resolution but it's only it's only  generates like  in in the kind of near distance in high  resolution and to be honest with you  this fun this may be what seemed like  Fantastical philosophical arguments um  we can have much more useful stuff that  don't go all the way for example when  you think about it what is the metaverse  even when you're playing a video game I  mean you are playing in a simulation I  mean not of the real world but you know  some video games are pretty close to the  real thing you can actually take films  of it and they can look pretty  convincing  um and I've seen some demos for example  like Nvidia are doing a lot of work on  this that uh the worlds that they are  creating are pretty much cinematic and  photorealistic you can't almost sell  them apart from the real thing  um and I think this is something that is  useful we could be having this uh  conversation like a video call in which  uh will not be actually us it will be  just an AI rendering of us and maybe you  know it makes it better resolution you  can see it in 3D and all that and in  fact Google have have been working on  this there are a number of companies  that have been working on this on being  able to track the face of someone and  the facial positions and everything and  actually being able to just transmit  those attributes and the AI recreates  the person on the other end so you can  have something that approaches like the  Hologram stuff that we see in sci-fi  um I think that is actually going to be  something that we'll see in the next  five years or so it's not like something  that we're gonna wait 20 years to see  um and I think even with the metaverse  there has been so much money being put  into it that I think at some point it's  gonna happen basically  um I'm not impressed right now with the  quality of the graphics that there are I  think a lot of video games out there  actually look nicer than than the demos  I've seen but you know it's a matter of  time  yeah exactly and isn't this part of the  mission of meta in in derivation of the  uh the metaverse where the um kind of  face tracking qualities of the Oculus  headset uh is uh enabling to produce a  photorealistic version of you in the  metaverse in real time that is kind of  part of the uh package that the meta is  trying to sell us that's the vision of  the future I believe as well and they  have produced some pretty amazing things  I think they have already announced kind  of the technology that they are working  on where they are right now and already  today it seems like this kind of um  realistic rendering of your your own  face let's say it's pretty far ahead  yeah yeah I think so I think that I  think that this technology is just gonna  improve  um I don't think that that people like  the clunky headgear that you have to use  um at the moment I think it's just too  heavy to to dorky looking basically I  mean if you're in the middle of uh of a  crowd of people you just look stupid  quite frankly  um so I think these are barriers that um  they are real barriers to the adoption  to the mass adoption of the technology  and even the fact that you have to  um well I'm used to wearing glasses or  lenses all my life I'm pretty much blind  otherwise  um so I'm used to wearing some form of  you know something on my eyes all the  time  um but  um it does get tiring using this VR  headsets at least you know until now and  this is something that people need to  actually solve  um before we start using it mainstream  because if you're gonna spend eight  hours 12 hours a day on this  um it's going to get styling and I know  it's like I mean they in challenge but  it is a challenge still  for sure to take a step uh back here  under and go back into the the world of  AI  um another  question that has been bugging my mind  and thinking about what comes next so to  say  um is the use of AI bots on social media  so take Twitter for example is plagued  with Bots at the moment and um Twitter  is doing whatever they can to create  software to combat this right to  recognize patterns in these bots in  order to in order to ban them from the  site but using tools like uh GPT and  kind of specialized AI tools that that  go say that you create an AI both with  the with the goal of getting a reply  from  Elon Musk on Twitter so that is the goal  of the AI for example and and then it  has to figure out what is the optimal  solution to approach Elon Musk to get  the reply from him and it may start that  you know you need to be you need to be  an [ __ ] basically like that's the  solution and if you're an [ __ ] you  optimize your chances to eventually get  the reply from Elon Musk but it could  also be that you want to build an AI  that  that optimizes as many people as  possible to  to take a political stance  and this has been the biggest  issue with social media in the last 10  or so years right which is that  nefarious players are trying to sway the  public into one side or the other and to  sway elections and so on I don't think  that has escaped anyone  um isn't it a quite scary capabilities  that the AIS will be able to kind of  sway the Masters in one way or the other  do you think about this as well and it's  something definitely definitely I mean I  do I don't just think about it it is  being done I mean there are entire  places  in in places I think for example like  Macedonia or like Moldova that's  actually their entire Villages of people  who create this content all the time  there are companies that actually do  this all the time and uh yeah pretty  enough area sectors that do this all the  time I mean some obviously there are  also more innocent uses like just to  yeah optimize the click-through rate on  some Campaign which I think is a more  kind of legitimate use of this stuff but  then as he said there are people who are  using this to undermine democracy to  spread misinformation willfully rather  than you know just by accident  um and it is going to be an issue in  fact how do you detect  um that something has been produced by  an AI or not  um even I as an AI expert find it  difficult sometimes certain output from  church activity is very difficult to  actually distinguish from something that  has been written by an actual human  um so we do need tools that and you know  if you're Twitter you'll have the entire  output of Twitter so you can use this  statistical pattern matching to try to  detect certain style that is you know  like the chat GPT style but the main  problem with this language models is  that they can generate so many styles  that is difficult to pick up exactly on  them so and and also it depends on the  social media network if it's something  that you can ask a question and get a  reply back maybe you can ask you know  like 20 different questions standard  questions and kind of see how this Bots  or accounts you know because you don't  know whether it's a human encounter  about replies and see you know try to  see whether this is likely to be about  likely to be a human and maybe repeat  the test over and over again every now  and then  um but obviously if you're just maybe  tweeting something every now and then  it's going to be very difficult for an  antibod system to do it because if I had  to build such a system I wouldn't just  have one account being run by my botnet  but I'll have many accounts that are  acting at different degrees of s honest  in this case you know to get uh to get a  reply  um so you know I think it's an actual  issue and uh I don't think it's you know  this is like spam I think it's gonna be  here to stay I don't think there's ever  going to be a perfect solution to this  luckily for us for example when it comes  to images  um the AI produced images so far they  always have a little bit of of an  artifact in them that you can actually  tear them apart but it's becoming also  more and more difficult to do that I  mean I've seen some of this work  um that have like high resolution images  of people in virtual settings and it's  obvious that it's virtual setting like  someone at the time of the Egyptians for  example  um and you know seeing the pyramids  being built so it's obvious that it's  fake but you can really not tell it  apart from a fake  um so I think this will be actually an  increasing problem  um and I don't think there is a hard  solution yet for it's it seems almost  like the Pandora's Box has been opened  and you can't close it again  um again going back to the issue of  social media  I mean as you point out there you know  the troll farms in Russia for example or  wherever  um they are limited to an extent which  is that you know there's only so many  human beings that you can fit in those  troll farms and there's only only so  many tweets that they can write  um however  with a software like chat GPT you can  create millions of accounts that are  simultaneously posting in a million  different  in a million different characters say or  in a million different ways and every  time an account is busted I should say  then there is another million accounts  that exactly that are active it doesn't  seem that there is a solution to this  because uh for the AI to stimulate a  human being and the and the variance  that the human being and the flaws that  a human being expresses through uh  typing  um it's quite  yeah it's quite difficult to discern  I mean at the end of the day like when  we type text there isn't that much  Nuance as it is when we are speaking for  example yeah uh with the facial  expressions and the micro expressions  and the you know the way we stumble on  Words and so on and so forth so for  example I saw the other day on YouTube  uh on advert popped out with um with  Elon Musk that was promoting like uh a  [ __ ] coin basically uh clearly this was  on AI rendered a video of Elon Musk and  it's very good but you can still see  clearly that it's um it's an AI  generated you know software of LMR  speaking but so but the point is  um in in text space it seems to be a lot  easier for an AI to replicate a human  being so to say and it doesn't like  again it doesn't seem that there is a  solution to this uh on yes for a  software like Twitter for example yes so  basically what you're mentioning is kind  of the information bandwidth problem  like the amount of context that you have  so if for example in a real-time  conversation like this you have a lot of  information because you're seeing the  other person you're seeing different  Expressions so it's kind of full-on  video you see the different lag so you  know whether it's real or not  um and us as human beings have evolved  this uncanny ability to actually detect  if something is wrong one of the  experiences I had actually once was  being on stage with the robot with the  Sofia but  um and while it is one of the best  examples of a humanoid looking robot you  could see that there were this kind of  little lags and delay and like for  example when she moves her eyes it was  like slightly off and you get this  uneasy feeling actually that there's  something wrong  um I obviously knew why it was wrong but  um even if you didn't if someone tries  to make you know the robot look even  more human there's always this Valley in  which you feel that there is something  wrong even if you can't put words to it  um however when you go down in the  amount of information and it's just a  still picture you have less and less but  our brains are very good at processing  visual information but when it comes to  text especially short text like tweets  you don't have that much context around  it so you know it is always going to be  difficult  um and who knows I mean with Google I  always have been thinking about this  with Google especially  um the definition of an authoritative  answer has been largely mixed up with  what is a popular answer because you  know the assumption is that popular  Pages popular  um whatever sources of information will  get a lot of followers basically now  this is the whole premise  um but it may be that at some point we  will still revive the idea of having an  authority on something  um and maybe have a mix you know I mean  you've seen the controvers is about the  verified marks I think that we will have  some kind of mixture of you know that  maybe in our old school approach which  kind of did help us have you know  variable peer-reviewed science  um you always have this kind of checks  um journalists used to do a lot of fact  checking I think they do less fact  checking  um nowadays than they did before so  maybe I think there will be this kind of  balance and you know what I think that  you do need an AI to fight an AI  um I think that the volume of  information that this tools are gonna  generate is just too much for for the AI  for a person to hand it  so so in the future it would be  basically a nefarious AIS and the kind  of the police AI uh trying to to catch  on on each other and trying to outdo  each other the human will be in it  you know on the other side filter your  spam filter does this already without a  spam filter you'll be getting so much  span so yeah we do need this kind of  Technology  yeah fair enough fair enough  so we've all heard of Chachi PT and um  obviously playing around in this  technology now  um Lanza made around saying social media  in the last couple of weeks where people  are generating their own like superhero  versions of themselves  um Dolly is obviously open AI is kind of  Imaging AI at all that made rounds  earlier in the air as well what are some  others interesting software that you're  aware of today  you can also experiment with and what  are some like upcoming yeah for example  like two of the two others um would be  for example mid-journey and stability AI  for for image generation I think that  those are actually some of the best  apart from Dali of acid Ali too  um I think those three are the best  tools that they're out there  um the thing is that then it depends on  how you're gonna use it so as a some  some tools for example like stability or  design to be easier to use by Common  People basically normal everyday people  um but then if you go to the you know  like to the API interface of that you do  need to have coding skills you do need  to have you know more and more advanced  stuff but you can actually visit at a  more advanced level so I think that they  are pretty accessible and people like  lensa have done a good job at making it  accessible and easy for people to use  basically  um I as you know I'm involved in AI art  um you know so something that I do  creatively  um and I've been using a lot of  different tools and in fact taking bits  and pieces of tools to generate new  forms of artwork  um and you can see that there's a lot of  stuff going on right now in the space  um being able to generate the the model  sensors and one of the limiting factors  is actually how long it takes and how  much it costs to train these models so I  think this is a limiting factor  um even GPT itself for example took a  lot of money to actually train  um stability for example took I think  more than 600 000 to train  um GPT probably they spend Millions by  now on the training of it so it's a very  expensive tool and also the amount of  processing it takes to generate the text  um it's also pretty prohibitive for for  example a small startup to do so you  know I think that the costs will go down  as there is better science and more  research into this but there is also a  cost to this which I think May limit the  amount of usage that you can do  okay okay what's the what are the  limitations would you say that the  current tools have today  um I've been experimenting a little bit  to see if we can for example digest the  quarterly report because we we do a lot  of reporting on costly reports and I  plugged it in there it didn't really  understand the context what is the  costly reports on and so forth that's a  very simple thing you can't do now of  course but um what's our limit what are  the limitations in the current  technology uh do you think under uh like  as we go into the next say one year two  years and so on  um do you think there are any um  um any of any specific uh things that it  will that that it will improve a lot on  or are there are there like limitations  in today's way of approaching the  development that leads us to kind of  hitting our wallet eventually yeah yeah  that's a very good question  um so so basically  um at the moment yeah we do have  actually this kind of limitations  um and uh one of the main things you hit  it exactly in fact  um the limitation of having uh the  understanding lack of understanding  basically  um and uh when when with you know the AI  right now does not understand the  context so you know if you give it  something like you know summarize  um this whole report  uh it does not know exactly how to do  that it may come up with something that  is plausible but since it does not  actually understand what it is writing  um you're gonna get basically something  that looks um plausible but it's  actually effectually inaccurate and this  is actually even worse than something  that is obvious  um that is obviously inaccurate because  you may actually be fooled by it or it  may have part of it that is accurate and  part of it that isn't  um so it's almost better that there is  like just a warning like listen I have  no idea what I'm talking about but this  is what I think  um I think that what I mentioned earlier  on um this neurosembolic AI architecture  is key to being able to have ai that can  explain how it works the decision making  process that it does and uh enable  people to actually be able to trust it  one of the other things that I'm seeing  a backlash for example in artistic  circles is also the use of the  underlying data that has been used to  train these models so for example there  is already like photographers artists  who are saying okay but used my material  without my permission to train this  model I wanted to be taken off  um and I think the traceability being  able to say okay  um let's say you say it give me a  summary about this report it needs to  the AI needs to be able to tell you okay  but this is why I think so and kind of  be able to explain the chain of  reasoning that it took in order for you  to trust it so I think this element of  trust is something that is missing at  the moment in current Ai and there is a  barrier in fact that if we're not gonna  switch to newer Technologies  um it's not something that is easily  overcome with the current technology so  that is I think one main area I think  also being able to as you said being  able to  to identify misinformation a little bit  better I think it needs to have a tool  like the generators need to have a tool  also that um can help people detect  whether it has generated its you know  this content or not so I think like a  Content checking tool like did I create  this or not I think that would be useful  and possibly you know if this stuff  starts getting very widespread  um at some point Society is going to  actually legislate this kind of  um tools that you'll have to to do it um  I I'm already seeing signs for example  in the EU  um that there's this AI act that is  probably coming into forest from next  year that will actually regulate the way  that companies use Ai and it has a lot  of implications effect into how you can  use AI in operations and dealing with  people for example that you have to  inform them that there is an AI who's  actually you know sent you this email  sent you this communication if I create  some kind of bonus offer um to someone I  need to be able to disclose um why for  example in certain cases I have done  that so I think it's actually something  that is positive  um for example I wouldn't want to really  get into a car into an automated car in  a busy  um States may be on a highway that is  not so busy I think it is pretty safe by  now but uh for example in uh in Sweden I  was a an in a car on automated mode and  it was skitting on Ice  um and when you think about it I mean  the Swedish algorithms should actually  be able to handle license no I mean if  it doesn't handle items not there I  don't know where it will handle  um this kind of weather and there was no  explanation I would have liked to  actually have some kind of explain  button on the dashboard that actually  tells me why is it doing this why did it  slow down for example suddenly and  unexpectedly so I think that this trust  building is very important  um to people and making it easy I think  making it accessible as you said like if  you don't need to be an expert to  generate good content I think then more  and more people are gonna start using it  and I can imagine you know the job that  teachers will have  um with uh school kids turning in their  homework basically exaggerated by  genevity right right that's already  happening today right  go back to the question of like what do  you what's your first thought how you  want to use the Chachi PT the kids are  like this is great like you never have  to do a homework ever again but also I  mean in a way uh teachers have to  embrace that charity pity in our exist I  mean you can't just pretend that it  doesn't exist and that it won't be  helpful to the world to some extent like  education has to change now as well with  the with you such a GPT because kids are  gonna use it right yeah exactly  I want to also ask you  um another question I mean uh what do we  expect now in the next uh you know one  or two years so to say um  if we go back a couple of decades you  know in the 90s an AI was able to beat  the Chess Masters of the world that was  like one of one of the major  breakthroughs that got a lot of  attention in the world right and that  was followed by chess being able to beat  the Masters in go which is a lot more  complex game and something that I never  expected was that  AI systems would be able to be the best  poker players in the world so I always  thought that human beings we have an  intuition and we'll be able to recognize  patterns in data tools but actually the  um they use air softwares I can now play  dto which is a game theory optimal they  can play Perfect poker against you  specifically low and your patterns and  exploit them and so on yeah um that was  a big breakthrough and um I saw that now  recently um uh there's been created on  AI both that is able to play diplomacy  perfectly as well which is a board game  that is based on negotiation so to like  a group of human beings are negotiating  with each other in order to reach the  best possible outcome and Anna both has  now been able to kind of uh understand  how to perfectly negotiate with human  beings  um this is seems to be an incredible  exponential curve we are saying now and  um if you look forward again like where  does this lead us it is indeed in fact  I'm glad you mentioned diplomacy because  um that's an example of very early  numerous symbolic AI so that is actually  a system where people have taken the  statistical kind of basis in which you  know you can play chess you can play go  you can even play poker it was also  surprising to me that they managed to  actually crack it completely because I  also always thought that there is a  little bit of element of Randomness and  human element in there but you know when  you think about it people are always  going to make mistakes they're gonna get  fatigued so the AI automatically always  has an edge overview over time it is  actually going to win and this kind of  information game so that they are  perfect or imperfect it still always has  disadvantage but when it comes to  negotiation when it comes to uncertainty  I think we still have the advantage  there so far  um but I think being able to reason  better to be able to collaborate with  people better I think these are the  skills that AI needs to learn  um how to interact in a more social way  how to interact you know like you  mentioned in the video people say um you  know sometimes they lag a little bit  being able to actually imitate it  knowing when to pause in a sentence and  when not to  um I know that there has been a lot of  work in fact about this and being able  to also understand the context and  modify the output according to the right  context  um let's say in medical AI if you're  speaking to a doctor versus speaking to  an old patient versus a very young  patient you may use the French language  you may use even if you're saying the  same thing you're gonna kind of adapt it  automatically to the situation and I  think this is where what AI needs to  learn better but you know we've seen so  many  things that have been  um improving that I have no doubt that  AI in the next five ten years is gonna  look totally different from what it  looks like now  right and I suppose this is the  important distinction when talking about  AI is AI is very good at operating in a  predictable world with set rules and no  ambiguity so in in a computer setting or  when you give it a specific rules of a  game it can perfectly figure out the the  game so to say or in in the context of  the internet it can operate within the  internet or within a computer  environment very very well so for  example if you ask a computer to  simulate driving in a in a simulated  environment it will drive perfectly  because the environment is predictable  however  they I suppose that the issue here that  is facing AI is how to operate in the  real world because the real world is  very unpredictable and it brings a lot  of ambiguity and messiness that is like  pretty much  um unlimited right so how do you drive a  car in Malta for example which it's like  where people are just doing stupid stuff  all the time that is like totally  unpredictable like someone is just you  know walking across the street without  giving any indication that they would do  so uh you know the next person next door  they screams at you that you're an  [ __ ] or whatever and um I suppose  that is the difference that there is  it's very difficult to program on AI to  meet all these like very ambiguous  challenges right then that seems to be a  the big limitation of AI today that it's  it just it's when it operates in the  real world it's like totally no like not  totally useless but it's very limited  compared to exactly so so being gave it  100 uncertainty being able to actually  explain the basis of How It's actually  taking decisions is also important  because that is one of the only ways in  which we can also then teach it what  it's getting right what it's getting  wrong so you know if I if I could have  been able for example the car to that  okay listen you're driving around the  roundabout and it is icy don't go so  fast for example like still in a  slightly different way if I could like  teach it and correct it in a  collaborative way  um I think AI will learn faster and will  adapt better basically and I'm sure that  this is what's gonna happen in fact this  is like the next step teaching AI how to  handle uncertainty and how to be maybe a  little bit less narrow applications like  widening them slightly I don't think  that we're gonna have you know things  you know in the next 10 years that can  handle anything you know like this  sci-fi General artificial general  intelligence I don't think that's gonna  happen in the next  um five ten years but I think if we  don't actually need such broad  applications of AI I think having  something that is useful enough is good  enough and I think that this is going to  start the cycle you know I mean look at  smartphones I mean the very first  version of the iPhone wasn't as capable  as you know the current  um phones  um but it started the whole Revolution  so you know it's with anything else once  people start using it and finding it  useful they put more and more effort  into it and it eventually improves so I  have a lot of Hope in fact and have an  optimistic Outlook that AI is going to  help us get a better society and you  know hopefully also impact Our Lives  both financially and also when it comes  to things like for example finding  keywords  um finding vaccines for example  automatically like one of the tests that  I knew that no one has some kind of like  super  um intelligent AI was that during covet  I mean otherwise if someone had it the  super AI they would have immediately  come up with a vaccine like in two days  or a week so that for me I was like  waiting okay if someone's gonna come up  with a solution very very quickly then  we probably are in trouble  um but that didn't happen so it was  proof that we're still not there yet  that's okay that's a good example well  Angelo I for one welcome our new AI  overlords here I just want to make that  statement very clear here so uh so uh so  that's on the record when the when AI  robots take over our lives here but um  thank you so much for explaining a  little bit more context here on chat GPT  and just generally a very philosophical  questions around uh AI um it's going to  be interesting I suppose if we do this  podcast in another two years time uh we  will have a very different set of  questions to answer that we cannot even  uh begin to imagine today I would I  would think but thank you so much for  coming on board today and I wish you all  thank you looking forward to the next  update thanks see you
