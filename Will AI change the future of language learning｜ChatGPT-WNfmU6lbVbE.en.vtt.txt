 Wow What?! Wow that’s a pretty good explanation… This is crazy! It’s mind-blowing, right? This is an AI chatbot called ChatGPT developed by OpenAI Thanks to my friend Andrew from Abchinese for recommending this to me! In this video we’re going to talk about how this tool can help you study a language We’re also going to discuss how AI may potentially change the future of language learning Hello everyone! I’m Grace from Grace Mandarin Chinese Let’s first take a look at what ChatGPT can do to help improve your language skills: If you have no idea how to use a word you can ask ChatGPT to explain the word to you For instance if you’re wondering how to use the word “果然”, you can type in “How to use 果然 in Chinese” and then here you can see it’s telling us the meaning of 果然 and it also includes us its pinyin and some example sentences for context If you’d like to see more examples you can just ask it to provide more As a native speaker, I’ll say all of the example sentences here are pretty natural and reliable In addition to providing meanings and examples ChatGPT can help correct your sentences For example now I’m writing a wrong sentence on purpose Let’s see if ChatGPT can correct it It corrected my sentence and I’m really impressed by the result because it corrected all of the grammar mistakes ChatGPT can also be used to clear up your confusion let’s say if you are watching a show in Chinese and hear people using the word 啥 but you don’t know if this word is formal or not you can ask: Is 啥 used in formal situations in Chinese? And now you have the answer: 啥 is considered an informal word which is accurate And it even lets you know which words you could use alternatively in a formal situation That’s really handy! If you encounter some concepts that you don’t understand you can also ask ChatGPT to explain them to you For example if I learn “measure word” in class but I don’t really get what its function is I can type in “What’s ‘measure word’ in Chinese” Okay let’s take a look at the answer the first part is pretty good but the second part is wrong we’d never say “幾個書”, even though 個 is indeed used very commonly the measure word for 書 is 本 So you can still find mistakes in its explanation but I’d say that most of the answers it gives are pretty good Just as you saw at the beginning of this video this AI chatbot can also provide you with sentence patterns for communication Like this you can ask “How to introduce myself in Chinese” and it’ll give you some related sentence patterns to use And you can also ask it to provide you with some material for studying like I showed at the beginning of this video if I’d like to improve my Chinese news reading skills then I can ask it to provide me with a vocabulary list of commonly used words in Chinese news There you go! It gives us twenty commonly used words and if, for example I’m specifically interested in news on environmental issues I can request some more words about this topic Now we've seen that this AI chatbot can help us with our language learning in various ways I have to say I’m really impressed by its ability to focus on our individual needs and to clarify confusion we may have It's like having our own personal language learning assistant available to us at all times which will definitely help us learn a language faster I think if it becomes more popular and is priced reasonably a lot of the work of a language teacher will become automated in this way Like, revising students’ essays or helping students with their questions outside of the classroom But what I’m not sure about is “Can AI technology reach the level where it can do all the work of a language teacher and help a student master a language?”. As a language teacher I think one thing that would be very hard to replace is the human connection The connection I have with my students is pretty strong and I don’t think that can be easily replaced However I still have a question for you If you can use AI to master a language in the future and the results are the same as learning with a real life teacher Which one would you choose? Let me know your answer in the comments! Also If you have any thoughts on how AI will change the future of language learning please share them in the comments! Alright thanks for watching to the end!
