 Okay. You want to learn about the future? It's the future is now. Because this morning, a new artificial intelligence to known as ChatGPT gained popularity for its ability to craft emails, write research papers and answer almost any question in a matter of seconds. It is a powerful new technology with extraordinary potential, but there are also warnings about the huge risk of misuse. You know, who knows all about th Vanessa Quick, she joins us now. Good morning. Sounds interesting and interesti but with caution. Intriguing, certainly. And a lot of analysts say it's as revolutionary as the But some say it's a threat to so But one thing is for sure, it's sparking interest among everyone from top CEOs to chat, graffiti, short for chat, generative. Pre-training Transformer is a ma learning model that can generate humanlike text. It's been trained on a massive amount of data, allowing it to understand and re to a wide range of questions. And prompts. What you just heard me reading wasn't written by me. It was written by artificial int chat GPT. I simply typed in a prompt write a TV news script written by a reporter about chat And in just seconds, the AI spit out the copy you just he she beat has exploded in popularity in recent months. CEOs are now using it to write e It even passed a Wharton School of Business exam Should people be more excited ab or more fearful of it? I think we should have a mixed y open API which owns Chat GPT says the technology is still in its research phase and can produce inaccurate infor You like artificial intelligence but are you here to issue a warning about it? Absolutely. Artificial intelligence is sort of like a teenager right It's exciting to see the teenage get its footing, but it's also not there yet, and we can't trust it. But Microsoft thinks it's a good Even with some risks, they're investing billions of dollars in open AI Jack Poe, CEO of Ansible Health, had GPT take three versi of the U.S. medical licensing test, and it passed all three. Not only can I answer very complex questions, it can also modulate its answer. Poe and his team of 30 doctors s using the platform to help with treatment for their patients who have COPD, a pulmonary disea What this technology could reall and has already started enabling is to suddenly suggest things that we might not be thinking of It will absolutely save lives Jake Heller is a lawyer and founder of Case Text, which helps its clients comb through documents using A.I. like Chat CBT. You can have it read a police re You can you can have it see if witnesses give contradictory testimony. You can almost certainly help find information that is pertinent to your guilt or innocence. But Poe and Heller both say that human oversight of is still necessary. OpenAI says the platform can pro harmful instructions in law. There absolutely is right and wrong answers. And that's why, you know, Chatty alone is not going to be enough some of the most important quest and feels like law. And then there's the question of plagiarism. New York City Public Schools Banned Chat on school network devices due to concerns about negative impacts on student learning and concerns regarding the safety and accuracy of content.

And that's the greatest fear of Spreading misinformation. Chat bot a tool designed to help humanity could ultimately hurt it. People who want to manipulate el and things like that, instead of like writing one thing at a time we could be able to write thousands of things to give for example, vaccine den more oxygen than it deserves. And Gary Marcus, you just heard from there, has written books about artificial intelligence. He has founded companies about artificial intelligence. He says we're about 75 years awa I truly being human like until t we need regulation and and Repre Ted Lieu from California he plans to introduce legislation to create an AI comm to oversee all of this new ideol Because we know a lot but we also know very little abo Some people are passing college courses with papers written by Chatty Beatty. Yeah. Just keep thinking of Space Odys how the hell 9000. No, I will not turn 21. A Space Odyssey gets a little sc We're almost there. Thank you, Vanessa. Great report
