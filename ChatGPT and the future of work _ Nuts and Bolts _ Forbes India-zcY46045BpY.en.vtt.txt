 chat GPT can write movie scripts drop  marketing proposals and even write and  debug code so how will it change the  future work I'm Marsha meghani and  you're watching nuts and bolts by Forbes  India  [Music]  Chad GTP has become a viral sensation  with its ability to provide human-like  answers to a wide variety of questions  it passed 1 million users in just five  days of its launch according to its  maker open AI  chat GPT trolls massive amounts of  information available on the web from  Wikipedia to Twitter data to news  articles and so forth reads them over  and over again to memorize them and then  generates intelligent and coherent text  in response to queries or prompts  this type of artificial intelligence is  called generative AI because of its  ability to generate fresh content  [Music]  much has been said about how chat GPT  can generate everything from exam essays  to computer code sure it can but it  might not be a hundred percent accurate  as Sam Altman the founder of openai  tweeted chat GPT is incredibly limited  but good enough it's some things to  create a misleading impression of  greatness  it's a mistake to be relying on it for  anything important right now it's a  preview of progress we have lots of work  to do on robustness and truthfulness  so right now the key benefit of using  chat GPT is its ability to save time  money and hassle on repetitive and  mundane tasks ask it to draft an email  for you come up with a marketing  proposal or write the code for a website  and it'll do just that in fact we  already use generative AI models without  perhaps realizing it think of how Gmail  finishes the sentences you type out or  how Microsoft Word auto checks your  document for grammatical errors  these Technologies are also built on  language models but the difference is  that gpt3 the language model on which  chat GPT is built is bigger and much  better  [Music]  experts believe that we will see a major  increase in the kind of things  generative AI can do this year itself  due to increased data availability and  improved algorithms they say generative  AI will soon become cheap enough and be  available as a service to be used in  business and everyday functions much  like electricity or the railways  so for example it could help make  automated customer service more  human-like you know when you're talking  to a bot when for example the food you  order from a food delivery app doesn't  arrive on time and you register a  complaint  the responses are standardized but  generative AI could change that so you  don't have to wait to speak to a human  to get a relevant answer  or it can serve as an intermediary  between you and your computer so instead  of having to create a chart in Excel by  yourself you can tell your computer hey  I have this data can you please help me  visualize it the generative AI model  will translate your request talk to  Excel and generate the chart for you  think of sentiment analysis where  companies can get to know what customers  think or feel about a product by  scouring the web for feedback or drug  development it could predict which drug  works best for which disease saving time  and billions of dollars or think of  search  Microsoft is investing 10 billion  dollars in openai over a series of years  hoping to incorporate the technology  into its Bing search engine  that could potentially disrupt Google's  business if say instead of receiving  dozens of links to a search query where  directed to a bespoke answer by a bot so  any area with large data sets can be  transformed with the help of generative  AI  [Music]  for generative AI technology is more  advanced than anything we've seen before  there is a general consensus within the  AI community that AI will never replace  human creativity it might do away with  the routine repetitive or mundane tasks  but that will simply free up time for  people to focus on the more challenging  areas of their work with computer coding  for example chat GPT is able to  replicate the well-defined aspects of it  but the real problem solving still needs  to be done by an actual software  engineer according to Anusha Rama Mohan  co-chair of the IIT future Tech panel  Court I think every technology  advancement replaces or reforms the  labor World in general there will be a  lot of jobs or a lot of parts of jobs  that may get redundant but at the same  time AI is generating a lot of  opportunities for example there's a  whole industry come up to create  training data for AI to annotate and  validate the data which never existed  before  besides you still have to ask the right  questions if you come up with the right  questions then maybe chat GPT can give  you the right answer end quote  so prompt engineer might well be a new  job description  [Music]  Chad GPT doesn't know right from wrong  or truth from false so it often  hallucinates that is gives you the wrong  answer but does so with confidence so an  amateur might still believe it that's it  it's a matter of time before the model  gets more and more accurate  second the models are only as good as  the data they're trained on if the data  is biased the model will also turn out  to be biased Microsoft's AI bot day for  example was famously taken down in 2016  after some users started to make racist  and sexist remarks  more worryingly because bigger is better  when it comes to generative AI models  the cost of developing such models can  only be footed by large tech companies  that means power is concentrated in a  few hands who decide what data sets a  model is fed and therefore decide what  we think and do AI experts call the  centralization and it's dangerous while  generative AI promises to be  transformative it's up to individuals  and organizations to make sure the  technology is used in a responsible and  ethical manner  [Music]  foreign  [Music]  foreign  [Music]
