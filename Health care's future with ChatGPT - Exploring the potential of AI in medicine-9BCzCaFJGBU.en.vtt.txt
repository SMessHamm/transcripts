 hi and welcome to the show rate and  review at kevinmd.com rate subscribe at  kevin.com podcast today to show we have  Harvey Castro he's a physician health  care consultant and serial entrepreneur  he's the author of the book chat gbt and  Healthcare the key to the new future of  medicine his Kevin MD articles titled  revolutionizing medicine how chat GPT is  changing the way we think about  Healthcare Harvey welcome to the show  thanks for having me it's an honor so  we'll get into your book an article in a  little bit but first off just briefly  share your story and journey to where  you are today yeah big picture I'm from  New York City first generation American  come from a really humble beginning a  beginning started in poverty which  actually I mentioned it because I really  think it changed who I am today and I go  into it because it gave me the passion  to work in healthcare and be that  position and I went into emergency  medicine and I always like talking about  that because it brings me to the next  point I love technology and I love  what's going out there and my first  taste of technology and Medicine really  came to home when I was in the emergency  room  and I had a patient that was coding and  at the time the first iPhone had just  came out and the nurse had a big  textbook was going through the textbook  and then finally got to the drug and  then finally got the medicine and  started and I thought this is taking too  long I need something so I actually  created the first Ahmed I called IV meds  app and it basically went through the  whole algorithm and it was just two  touches and it gave you the dose and so  that's kind of a little quick background  about me  all right so tell me about that  intersection you're you are in that Tech  business world you're a Serial  entrepreneur so tell me in terms of  being a physician I always ask this of  physician entrepreneurs has that  background being a physician has that  helped you or hurt you in your  entrepreneurial Endeavors I love that  question actually I think it's helped me  a lot because I understand the limits  from a physician's point of view and  then I can also look at it from the  administrator's point of view and how  they see medicine and then I can look at  both and see how can I make that best  intersection because I think sometimes  administrators see it without the  medicine and they want to do things that  we just can't or ethically we won't and  so looking at from the doctor's side and  understanding the science and creating a  new product and that's the part that I  love so I think if anything is helping  me now for those Physicians who are  interested in getting that Tech space it  could be a health I.T startup or  whatever so what kind of advice do you  have for these Physicians who want to be  more involved in that Tech space  honestly my biggest thing is it's just  like education we all work really hard  to get that MD and it took some grit for  us to get through it it's the same thing  with technology just keeping up and  learning starting with the basics and  then going up the ranks with that said  at your hospital I would encourage you  to be the leader at your hospital  because before you know it you're the  one reading you're the one keeping up to  date and then the administration is  going to be coming to you  all right so let's talk about  your article how chat GPT is changing  the way we think about health care and  for those who don't know of course chat  gbt one of the highest adoptive apps  that's out there and we're gonna talk  about a little background for those who  aren't familiar and how it intersects  with our lives as Physicians now just to  get here on the same page Harvey what is  chat gbd  uh that's such a hard question and I  have been asked that a million times and  each time I have a hard time answering  my best example is think of it as having  a conversation with something that  you're currently using so let's just say  you're using up to date and you're  looking up a patient chat GPT gives you  the ability to not only just ask the  question but personalize that question  so to give you a quick example would be  if you have a diabetic patient and you  need to understand the for the patient  how to give them a better advice on the  glycemic index what you could do is go  into chat gbt say I need a diet for this  patient it needs to be low sugar but  then you can take it to the next step  you can say patient also has allergies  to egg doesn't like fruit give me a diet  and it'll actually make that diet for  you and then fast forward once it gives  it to you you can say I need a grocery  list and it'll print it out for you and  then after that you can say give me the  restaurants because this weekend I'm  going to be in Miami and I need to  follow this diet and it'll actually tell  you what restaurants have that diet so  these are the capacity that it could do  more than what Google could just do a  search engine now how exactly does it  work in terms of getting this  information formulating responses how  does dot gbd work it's amazing the  database is up to date up to the year  2021 this is the current application I  believe next month or an exported  there's rumors that in the next Edition  will come and my guess is it'll be up to  date up until that date and how does it  work interesting enough it does not go  into the internet you would think it's  just going into the internet and it's  just getting information that way  actually it's going through  massive amounts of different databases  and it's Gathering that information that  you're asking it and literally combining  it and putting it into a chat format so  that way you can interact with it my  biggest warning with it and I I joke  with this in a respectful way it's the  best salesman in the world because no  matter what you ask it will give you an  answer the difference is when you get  that answer it could be what we call a  hallucination effect where I'm an ER  doctor you can tell me anything and if  chat TPT says something wrong I can call  it out but I'm not a dermatologist so if  it went into something very specific  into Dermatology I would look at it and  say yeah looks good to me but a  dermatologist would read and be like no  this is totally incorrect and so it's  just fascinating to me how how this  technology is being used right now in  medicine  now you've already written a book on  this chat gbt and Healthcare the key to  the new future of medicine chat GDP only  came out at the end of November you've  already written a book about it so you  clearly thought about the massive  implications that chat GPT has on  Healthcare so give us a high level  overview what are some of the high  points in terms of how it's going to  affect our lives as Physicians yeah I  think there's a difference between what  we can do today and what we can do  tomorrow so from 10 000 feet I wanted to  just introduce the subject so that  Physicians can start spending time and  thinking about it I feel like some of us  in healthcare take a little bit of time  to adjust to new technologies and I knew  that this was going to end up taking a  big portion of what's called Healthcare  and chat gbt and so how I see this done  the simplest way I see it as education  every 72 days medical knowledge doubles  and so being able to go into a database  ask it questions and be able to answer  those I think it's a plus and so I'll  take it to a real example I'm meeting  with different medical students for  providers and they're saying that for  medical school they're having it they're  putting in maybe a PDF of like a chapter  on you know Cardiology and it'll  summarize a chapter give them the high  points it'll make tables for them it'll  make flash cards for them for a  practitioner I'm actually seeing I got a  great example the other day I met with a  Pediatric Cardiologist he said that he  was able to diagnose this patient and  there was only 200 cases in the whole  world with this and he for Giggles  wanted to put all the symptoms that he  saw of the patient in Chachi PT he put  the symptoms the prior Imaging studies  and it came out with the diagnosis and  he was shocked because he said Harvey  this is something and he even mentioned  the disease to me I can't remember it  myself right now but it was something so  rare and I thought you know from a point  of view of it's not going to replace a  human I I don't think but I think it  will help supplement and you know  unfortunately doctors can't know  everything and so that's why we all  specialize but then being in our  specialty it changes so much how nice  would it be to use that tool so that's  what I'm seeing a lot of right now and  then one more example on the ER side I  work close to an airport and then the  airport we were getting people from all  over the world and unfortunately my EMR  didn't have the discharge instructions  for that language and so again assume  mean I'm not putting anything inside his  hip obviously into this and there's 18  identifiers I could go in put the  diagnosis and say this is a person's  language and it would translate and then  I could hand that to the patient and I  thought what an amazing tool that I  could use for my patients  what is it specifically about Chachi BT  that just makes such an impact because  there's just so much technology that's  that's introduced to Physicians and it  ends up making not a difference what's  special specifically about we call this  generative AI of course what specific  about generative AI that you think is  going to be such a big impact on our  lives in contrast to some of the other  technological innovations  I think it's because it can adapt and  Medicine adapts so fast and the fact  that this technology can adapt faster  than we can recall a lot of these  subjects I think that's one big one I  think in my opinion Healthcare from a  physician patient point of view it's a  lot about education you have an  education on a certain disease and  you're passing that education to a  patient and helping them change their  practice or changing the practice  health-wise and so I think Chachi BT can  help you as far as on the patient side  and the physician let me give a quick  example if we talked about the position  what about the patient what if the  patient knew they have diabetes they're  following up with you as a primary care  doctor but then they could say what are  the best questions for my doctor and  what are the follow-up questions and  then going into the physician a patient  relationship they usually only get 13  minutes as a national average with the  doctor what if that 13 minutes was so  high yield that they had these questions  from chat GPT and said hey this is what  they said here you go do you bless this  and then now you're really creating an  environment and I foresee that being in  the future I foresee  websites apis that will go that will go  out with chat CPT that will integrate  with basically computer systems and  websites but then a patient can go ask  those medical questions and then chatgpt  will generate the answer but then  they'll be a human being a physician  that will read it bless it and send it  back to the patient that brings us to  the point about accuracy right so a lot  of Physicians if or patients for that  matter if they're asking chat DBT for  you know medical advice medical  information if you give it a  constellation or symptoms you'll give  back a potential diagnoses comment about  the accuracy that you're seeing with  chai GPT as it relates to health  information  well it's a hard one because I could  only comment on things that are in my  space and I think that's a a very  important statement because other  Physicians out there may be blessing  medical Knowledge from chat GPT that may  not be in their space I know this  respect to those Physicians but it may  be so specialized of a answer back from  Chachi PT that they may not recognize  that in fact as an error and so I'm  always cautioning patients especially  patients outside the United States  because I feel like  um people outside the United States can  self-diagnose and then go straight to a  pharmacy pick up medication take the  medication and make what if it's the  wrong medication what if it's the wrong  disease what if the allergy I mean  there's a million things so from an  Ethics point of view I think this has  got to be taking with caution and that's  why I want to educate both the  Physicians and patients how to use this  tool correctly because my bigger worry  there's a negative outcome out in the  world because of chat CPT then it's  going to delay the progress and it's  going to end up hurting people in the  long run because we cannot use this  technology  talk about the company behind chai gbt  It's a startup called open AI I know  Microsoft has invested billions of  dollars in this  in terms of all the information that  we're putting in charge EBT  privacy HIPAA how are they using what  we're putting is this something that we  need to be concerned about of course yes  and and I tell every doctor and patient  please do not put anything as far as  your personal information and and I even  know this until recently I didn't  realize that when someone passes away up  to 50 years later that information  cannot be shared and so please don't put  anything on the chat GPT servers just to  give you a quick background open AI  originally was supposed to be open and  Elon Musk and other billionaires put  money into it because their goal was to  keep this independent from a private  sector Microsoft came along invested I  believe they have about 49 ownership  right now and so now it to me it's not  really open it's more Microsoft product  and so with that said now that from an  ethical point of view it kind of changes  things because now this isn't open now  it's endorsed by a company now it's  going to be looked as a product and it's  Gotta create a financial gains and so  from an ethical point of view I worry  that perhaps people that don't have the  funds for this technology will not be  able to get it and those that have the  funds will be able to use it and we'll  be able to do better at work or maybe  eventually get better health care and so  from an ethical point of view it just  it's an interesting question to just  kind of think about  so I'm a primary care physician I do  Internal Medicine I see patients three  days a week  do you see any application for chat gbt  in the exam room in a typical office  visit with a physician  yes I'm working with some companies and  what they're doing is creating an  independent server that way it's not all  that information is not going back to  the main database and they're basically  creating I call it like a mini chat GPT  server and so what they're wanting to do  is for example you would see a patient  and the patient would give you different  symptoms then two things would happen  chat GPT could interact with the patient  can create summaries so when the next  time you see the patient it could go  back to the last 20 times and give you a  one-page summary of all those visits and  then anything more that you want can do  I know you already have that but this  will be a better summary other  applications I love is just the medical  education portion so on the discharging  of these patients you can customize so  when you discharge a patient that's 80  year old with diabetes versus a person  that maybe a 18 year old your therapy  may be different and your advice may be  different and so because of that  customization effect through Chachi PT  that is a way that it'll be used I think  fast forward I don't personally think  it's going to be chat GPT I think it's  going to be bio GPT and that'll be  another article in the future that I'm  going to write about but I think that's  what's going to be the future in  healthcare  we read about the potential threats to  some jobs that chat GPT may bring is  there anything that Physicians need to  be worried about going forward in terms  of chai gbt improving to a point it may  infringe on some physician  responsibilities  I love that question and I see a lot of  debate about that question I personally  do not see it taking our job away at  least in my lifetime I see it more that  those that understand this technology  and are being efficient with this  technology those are the ones that are  going to eventually be hired by the  bigger Hospital systems and are going to  want those to be promoted and those that  are Physicians that are resistant to  change that do not want to use these  tools I think those doctors eventually  will not have a job and in that sense  they will be replaced but not the way  we're thinking by a computer it'll just  be by another person that's using it and  I see this more as an assistant for  example  I've worked 30 hour shifts in the ER I  know at four five in the morning I'm  really exhausted I'm doing my best to  give my best care but how nice would be  to have a peripheral brain just like we  have on our mobile devices why not have  that resource that I can say you know  what I'm on the fence and it's already  integrated into EMR and it's showing me  okay the patient's head chest pain five  different times this and that here's  your differential diagnosis and I look  at it I'm like actually there is one on  the list here that I haven't really  ruled out let me order this following  test or you know I was on the fence I  wasn't going to order this but the  computer is really saying there's a 90  predictive value that this is probably  the diagnosis and I may be missing it  let me order these tests or let me  actually double check I think that's how  it's going to end up being used  we're talking to Harvey Castro he's a  physician Healthcare consultant and  serial entrepreneur his book is titled  chat GPT in healthcare the key to the  new future of medicine we're talking  about his Kevin MD article  revolutionizing medicine how shot GPT is  changing the way we think about health  care  Harvey I know that there's been some  seismic changes Chachi PD has only been  here for about three to four months now  what do you see the next normally I say  one year to bring a generative AI is  moving so quickly what's the next few  months going to bring  honestly there's lots of rumors now  they're going to add images to chat GPT  and when that happens again this is  rumors I believe it's gonna  revolutionize medicine especially  Dermatology and let me give you a quick  example if you could put symptoms and a  picture of a mole or picture of a  pathology then and chat CPT is able to  look at those factors and turn around  and say it's possibly this then I know  that already exists out there in some  companies but I think this is going to  change that and then fast forward if you  can if I can show a picture of you to  chat GPT and it turns around and says  okay here's his website here's  everything those are the things that are  coming and imagine all the medical  applications that can come from that and  that's with chatgpt4 and I really think  that's going to happen this year  and my final question tell us some of  your take-home messages you want to  leave with the Kevin and the audience  honestly at the end of the day I just  want everybody just to keep up with  technology I know some of us are  resistant to change but just learn about  it and my take-home message is there's  nothing wrong with just reading about it  and learning about it and so that's  basically it stay up to date  Harvey thank you so much for sharing  your time and insight and thanks again  for being on the show thank you  [Music]  foreign
