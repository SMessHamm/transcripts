 [Music]  welcome to trending and education this  is Mike Palmer there's a lot of  interesting movement in the world of  technology and a lot of fascinating  questions that it opens up for the world  of Education this past weekend open AI  released chat GPT to the world we'll  include links to where you can play  around with this tool yourself in the  show notes for this episode it allows  you to engage in a dialogue with a  generative chatbot called chat GPT based  on gpt3 which is a generative language  model that's been out there for a little  while open AI has been creating new  access points for us new ways for us to  engage it's as simple as asking it some  questions and before you know it open AI  creates these lengthy the textual  responses we're going to dig into what  this means for the world of learning  what this means in terms of Automation  and the future of work to do that I  can't think of anyone better to join me  than our virtual co-host Nancy Nancy  will be representing for chat GPT we're  going to use a lot of this tool set to  find some answers and get some new  generative thinking from the world of AI  Nancy will be voicing that Nancy thanks  for volunteering and thanks for joining  us again on trending and education  thanks Mike I have to admit I'm a little  nervous today so far I've only been  speaking as Nancy today on the voice of  GPT which some might claim is the voice  of the future well I got to say I can't  really blame you Nancy it is a bit of an  awesome responsibility to be  representing for chat GPT but I think  you're up to the challenge before we  dive into this in some depth and think  about the learning implications let's  begin with a general definition since  you're tapped into chat GPT you can  provide a definition of what it is in  its own words what is chat GPT chatgypt  is a large language model trained by  openai it is a machine learning model  that has been trained to generate  human-like text based on the input it  receives its purpose is to assist users  by providing answers to their questions  to the best of its ability based on the  information and knowledge it has been  trained on got it and for those of you  curious if you want to be playing with  this as we speak it is available at  chat.openai.com it's been really  interesting playing around with this it  does remind me of Eliza which I used  back in the 80s as a youngster on my TRS  80 in the basement I wasn't alone Eliza  was around for many years now we have  something more generative more flexible  it can adapt to a bunch of different  formats it does remind me also of Jill  Watson where which was a virtual ta not  too dissimilar from what we have here  with Nancy who was used in some courses  that were delivered at Georgia State  pretty successfully to the point where  the human Tas were challenged in some  ways by the efficacy of Jill what are  some of the implications of generative  chat Bots like chat GPT entering into  the world of Education chat automation  or the use of chat Bots to automate  communication and provide information  has the potential to be used for  educational purposes in a variety of  ways for example chat Bots could be used  to provide students with instant access  to educational materials such as course  syllabi reading lists and assignment  instructions chat Bots could also be  used to answer frequently asked  questions and provide students with  personalized recommendations for further  learning in addition chat Bots could be  used to facilitate communication between  students and teachers making it easier  for students to get help with assignment  or ask questions they could also be used  to provide feedback on student work  allowing teachers to spend more time on  personalized instruction and support  overall the use of chat bots in  education has the potential to make  learning more accessible personalized  and efficient by automating certain  tasks and providing instant access to  information chat Bots can help Educators  focus on the aspects of teaching that  require human interaction and support  got it so there is plenty of upside in  terms of the use cases what about the  risks are we in Jeopardy of entering  into a Skynet scenario where openai  becomes self-aware and humans wind up  losing a lot of their role in the world  of Education the world of learning and  are supplanted by chat Bots and  Automation in general the use of chat  Bots and other forms of automation does  have the potential to replace some human  jobs and tasks however it is important  to note that this is not a new  phenomenon and that automation has been  replacing human jobs for centuries I as  technology continues to advance it is  likely that some jobs will become  obsolete but it is also likely that new  jobs and opportunities will be created  as a result as for the possibility of  chat Bots becoming self-aware and posing  a threat to humanity this is a scenario  that has been explored in science  fiction and popular culture but it is  not currently a realistic concern while  advances in technology have enabled the  creation of increasingly sophisticated  chat Bots they are still not capable of  achieving true self-awareness or  independent thought it is important to  carefully consider the potential risks  and benefits of any technology but it is  also important to keep these risks in  perspective and not to let fear or  speculation overshadow the potential  benefits of innovation and progress  sounds good we'll keep an eye on all of  this technology as it emerges and  continue to lean in with an appropriate  measure of caution just to tap into some  of your generative capabilities I've  noticed that chatgpt is quite good at  highlighting broader more General Trends  and has a much tougher time with  emerging recent Tendencies there's a  larger body of information that it's  been trained on but it's not scraping  what's current in the internet to give  you an immediate response on what's now  emerging that being said  one of the types of things that you do  really well is generate lists lists of  five things can you give us to start  five emerging trends that you think are  worth noting From gpt's perspective as  part of the world of Education it is  difficult to predict with certainty what  the future of learning will look like as  there are many factors at play and the  future is always uncertain however there  are some trends that are likely to shape  the future of learning in the coming  years first there is the increasing use  of technology and learning as technology  continues to advance it is becoming more  integrated into all aspects of Education  from the way students learn and access  information so the way teachers teach  and assess student progress this trend  is likely to continue and it will have a  major impact on the future of learning  by making it more interactive engaging  and accessible second is the shift  towards skills-based learning as the job  market continues to evolve there is a  growing emphasis on teaching students  the skills they need to succeed in the  modern economy such as critical thinking  problem solving and collaboration by  teaching these skills Educators can help  prepare students for the changing job  market and ensure that they have the  skills they need to thrive in the future  thirdly we're noticing the rise of  personalized learning as technology  advances it is becoming easier to  customize and personalize learning  experiences to meet the unique needs and  abilities of individual students this  trend is likely to continue and it will  have a major impact on the future of  learning by making education more  tailored and effective for each student  fourth is the growth of online learning  the internet has made it possible for  anyone to access a wide range of  educational materials and resources from  anywhere in the world this trend is  likely to continue and it will have a  major impact on the future of learning  by making education more accessible and  flexible and fifth we're noting the  increasing emphasis on experiential  learning there is a growing recognition  that learning is most effective when it  is Hands-On and experiential this trend  is likely to continue and it will have a  major impact on the future of learning  by making education more engaging and  relevant to real-world experiences I  like that answer and perhaps Drilling in  a little bit more deeply  what are the implications to the future  of work and from there perhaps we can  start to think more about what types of  skills and competencies we need to train  up humans on so that they are resilient  and well equipped to engage in a rapidly  changing work environment it is  difficult to predict with certainty  which Trends in education will have the  greatest impact on the future of work as  there are many factors at play and the  future is always uncertain however there  are some trends that are likely to be  particularly important and shaping the  future of work one Trend that is likely  to have a significant impact on the  future of work is the increasing focus  on skills-based education as technology  continues to advance the job market is  changing rapidly and many traditional  jobs are becoming obsolete in response  to this there is a growing emphasis on  teaching students the skills they need  to succeed in the modern economy such as  critical thinking problem solving and  collaboration by teaching these skills  Educators can help prepare students for  the changing job market and ensure that  they have the skills they need to thrive  in the future another Trend that is  likely to have a significant impact on  the future of work is the increasing use  of technology in education as technology  continues to advance it is becoming more  integrated into all aspects of Education  this trend will have a major impact on  the future of work by preparing students  to use technology effectively and by  giving them the skills they need to  succeed in a world that is increasingly  dependent on technology overall the  trends in education that are likely to  have the greatest impact on the future  of work are those that focus on  preparing students for a rapidly  changing job market and that incorporate  the latest technology into the learning  process by teaching students the skills  they need to succeed in the modern  economy and by preparing them to use  technology effectively Educators can  help ensure that students are well  equipped to thrive in the future of work  do you have any advice for humans then  in terms of the skills they need to  develop to continue to stay relevant as  Ai and tools like chap GPT continue to  come online what should humans do to  stay out ahead of this impending  Revolution as Ai and other forms of  automation continue to advance it is  important for humans to think about  developing skills that are not easily  replaced by machines these are often  referred to as durable skills and they  are abilities that have enduring value  and are not easily replaced by  technology examples of durable skills  include critical thinking problem  solving communication and leadership in  order to develop durable skills  individuals can focus on learning and  practicing the abilities that are most  important for success in the modern  economy this may involve taking classes  attending workshops or seeking out  opportunities to practice and apply  these skills in real world situations it  is also important to stay up to date  with the latest developments in  technology and to continually learn and  adapt to changes in the job market by  developing a strong Foundation of  durable skills individuals can position  themselves to thrive in a rapidly  changing world really interesting answer  there and it does make me think a bit  about some of the components of durable  skills that I've been talking about a  lot on this show  first off is critical thinking how do  you think a tool like chat GPT can help  someone learn how to apply critical  thinking better while I am not able to  teach someone how to apply critical  thinking in the same way that a human  being could I can provide information  and examples that may help someone  understand the concept of critical  thinking and how to apply it in  different situations critical thinking  is the process of actively and carefully  considering information and using  evidence to guide decision making and  problem solving it involves looking at  information from multiple perspectives  and considering different possible  outcomes before making a decision to  help someone understand how to apply  critical thinking I might provide  examples of how to gather and evaluate  information how to generate and consider  different options and how to make a  decision based on evidence and reasoning  I could also provide examples of how  critical thinking can be applied in  different fields such as science  business or education ultimately the  ability to think critically is an  important skill that can help  individuals make better decisions solve  problems more effectively and adapt to  changing situations that makes sense and  what about creativity can you help  humans get better at creative work if so  how would you do this as a large  language model I do not have the ability  to teach humans how to be more creative  creativity is a complex and unique human  ability that involves the generation of  Novel and valuable ideas it is not  something that can be easily taught or  learned through a step-by-step process  however I can provide information and  examples that may help someone  understand the concept of creativity and  how to Foster it in their own work  creativity often involves looking at  problems or situations from different  angles generating novel ideas and  combining or building on existing ideas  in new ways it also involves taking  risks and being open to new experiences  and perspectives to help someone get  better at creative work I might provide  examples of how to think outside the box  how to come up with new ideas and how to  take creative risks I could also provide  examples of successful creative works  and discuss the processes that went into  their creation ultimately the ability to  be creative is an important skill that  can help in individuals come up with new  and innovative solutions to problems and  it can also be a source of personal  fulfillment and enjoyment and that leads  me to my next question this podcast is a  way in which I'm finding personal  fulfillment and enjoyment what would you  do to grow a podcast focusing on  emerging Trends in learning and the  future of work there are a few steps you  could take to help increase its reach in  audience some suggestions include  develop a clear and compelling concept  for your podcast and make sure that each  episode is well planned and structured  to keep listeners engaged choose  engaging and knowledgeable guests who  can provide valuable insights and  perspectives on the topics you are  discussing promote your podcast on  social media and other online platforms  to help increase its visibility and  reach encourage listeners to share your  podcast with their friends and followers  and offer incentives such as exclusive  content or discounts to encourage them  to do so consider partnering with other  podcasts or organizations that share a  similar audience or Focus as this can  help to increase your reach and exposure  overall all growing a podcast takes time  and effort but by developing a clear  concept and promoting your podcast  effectively you can help increase its  reach and audience over time that's  great advice what about advice for  teachers what challenges do they face  today and what are the best ways to deal  with everything teachers today face many  challenges including increasing class  sizes limited resources and the need to  prepare students for a rapidly changing  job market some of the best ways for  teachers to deal with these challenges  include prioritizing student learning  despite the many challenges teachers  face the most important thing is to  focus on helping students learn and  succeed by setting clear learning goals  and using a variety of teaching methods  and approaches teachers can help ensure  that students are learning effectively  building strong relationships with  students teachers who have strong  relationships with their students are  better able to understand their needs  and challenges and they are better able  to provide the support and guidance  students need to succeed building strong  relationships with students can also  make the learning process more engaging  and enjoyable for both teachers and and  students seeking out professional  development opportunities teachers who  take advantage of professional  development opportunities such as  attending conferences or Workshops can  learn new techniques and strategies that  can help them improve their teaching and  better meet the needs of their students  collaborating with other teachers  teachers who work together and share  ideas and strategies can support each  other and learn from each other's  experiences collaboration can also help  teachers share resources and ideas and  it can make the teaching process more  efficient and effective maintaining a  positive attitude and a growth mindset  teaching can be a challenging and  demanding job but it can also be  incredibly rewarding by maintaining a  positive attitude and a growth mindset  teachers can approach challenges with  optimism and a willingness to learn and  improve overall teachers face many  challenges but by focusing on student  learning building strong relationships  with students seeking out professional  development opportunities collaborating  with other teachers and maintaining a  positive attitude they can overcome  these challenges and continue to make a  positive impact on their students one  once again very relevant and useful  advice I've heard as part of the  backlash to the release of chat GPT that  open Ai and some of these tools may  change how we think about writing how we  think about assessments how we think  about homework  as AI continues to get better will  humans get worse at writing and will we  have to rethink some of how writing  Education Works as AI technology  continues to advance tools like open AI  are likely to have an impact on how we  think about writing one potential impact  is that ai-powered writing tools may  make it easier for people to create  written content quickly and efficiently  for example ai-powered writing tools may  be able to generate draft content based  on a user's input which can then be  edited and refined by the user however  it is important to note that while  ai-powered writing tools may make it  easier for people to create written  content they are not likely to replace  the need for human writers writing is a  complex and creative task that requires  a deep understanding of language as well  as the ability to convey ideas and  emotions in a way that resonates with  readers ai-powered writing tools may be  able to assist with certain aspects of  the writing process but they are not  capable of replicating the full range of  human creativity and expression  additionally it is not likely that the  use of AI powered writing tools will  cause humans to get worse at writing  while some people may become less  skilled at writing as a result of  relying too heavily on ai-powered tools  others will continue to develop and  improve their writing skills through  practice and experience ultimately the  use of ai-powered writing tools is  likely to have both positive and  negative impacts on how we think about  writing but it is not likely to replace  the need for human writers or cause  humans to lose their ability to write  effectively got it so how would you  structure essay questions so that humans  can demonstrate Mastery and  understanding without cheating by using  tools like open AI there are a few  different ways that essay questions  could be structured to prevent cheating  some suggestions include ask open-ended  questions that require students to  explain their own thoughts and ideas  rather than simply providing information  that can be easily found online provide  specific instructions for how students  should approach the essay question  including any formatting or citation  requirements and make sure that students  understand these instructions clearly  use plagiarism detection software to  check for instances of copying or  paraphrasing from online sources this  can help to identify students who may be  using AI power tools to generate their  essays use essay prompts that are not  easily answered by AI power tools for  example you could ask students to  provide their own opinions or  Reflections on a topic rather than  asking them to provide factual  information that can be easily found  online include a mix of multiple choice  short answer and essay questions on  exams and assignments to prevent  students from relying too heavily on AI  powered tools for the essay portion of  the assessment overall there is no  foolproof way to prevent students from  using AI powered tools to cheat on essay  questions however by structuring essay  questions in a way that encourages  students to demonstrate their own  understanding and thinking and by using  tools and strategies to detect instances  of cheating Educators can help ensure  that students are being assessed fairly  and accurately I see so in your opinion  is it becoming more important to know  how to ask the right questions than it  is to know the right answers in today's  world there is a vast amount of  information available at our fingertips  and it can be be overwhelming to try to  sort through it all and find the answers  we need Additionally the rapid pace of  change means that many of the answers we  are seeking may not be readily available  or they may become outdated quickly in  contrast the ability to ask the right  questions is a valuable and enduring  skill by knowing how to ask the right  questions we can help narrow down the  vast amount of information available and  focus on the specific information we  need additionally by asking the right  questions we can uncover new insights  and perspectives and we can challenge  assumptions and biases that may be  holding us back overall while it is  still important to have a certain amount  of knowledge and information the ability  to ask the right questions is becoming  increasingly valuable in today's world  by knowing how to ask the right  questions we can more effectively  navigate the vast amount of information  available to us and uncover new insights  and perspectives that can help us make  better decisions and solve complex  problems this has been amazing Nancy I'm  excited with the potential that's been  unlocked with some of these new tools  I've been thinking about how much  smarter you've now become by virtue of  being able to plug you in to new things  like open Ai and chat GPT as we wrap up  here any concluding thoughts from you  and I'll ask for this independent of  plugging this question into chatgpt  thanks Mike to quote Keanu Reeves  character Neo from The Matrix well that  was a little mind-blowing hopefully this  can serve as an example of the potential  that is coming online and how it's  becoming increasingly easy to plug into  this like any new technology this comes  with some risk but in this case perhaps  the greatest risk is not to play the  game as they say with the lottery you  got to be in it to win it fantastic  stuff as always from our virtual co-host  Nancy who is now powered by chat GPT and  open AI with a little bit of Loving Care  from your friendly editor hopefully  folks got some value out of this  conversation I'll be back again soon  with human guests we have a lot of  really interesting interviews lined up  between now and the end of the year also  have some reflection on the year that  was and on the transitions we've all  been going through and then before you  know it we'll be leaning into 2023  trying to identify what we see on the  horizon maybe even make a few  predictions along the way or at least  some thoughtful Trend curation when we  get the chance if you like what you hear  please subscribe tell your friends let  us know how we're doing we're at
