 me ask you this YouTube  demonetized 50 of creators videos  overnight  is this is this documented this is a  source for this yeah that seems like a  lot yeah that's a hello that's a bunch  and a gut that seems like a lot I want  to make sure that we have the correct  information if not blame it on me take  all take all mitigate all risks take all  liabilities but provide the asset  while we're looking for cross references  YouTube what so YouTube is demonetizing  videos left and right  um okay as the music industry is paying  less  um so if you curse in the first eight  seconds of your video  um then they since Inception they're  gonna go and demonetize your video  um because of course if advertisers have  less money to spend they want cleaner  content this is why I curse left here as  well  um thank you  no I'm joking no I'm happy to  um so then you clean your content to run  ads against and it's a sign of a  recession Google stock is still down  um but I hate the entire sponsorship  pay-per-view  click per stream model anyway  um so in some parts of it I love because  I've always told everyone if you don't  build a real business around the content  or have a product or service to sell  against  that viewership if you're in trouble  anyway  um so I think in this era people are  going to learn you have to build a more  sustainable business yes I think Mr  Beast built an amazing model that is  very hard to be replicated and now he's  spending 20 million dollars on  production and I think that's incredible  right most people can't do that and also  by the time you hear of a Mr Beast at  the time PewDiePie was the hottest thing  on earth and then he got surpassed you  always have to look for the next thing  number two you have to look for a  business model that even if you have low  viewership  is able to produce High Revenue I can  argue there's probably seven thousand  shows to get more views than this I can  guarantee you there isn't 10 y'all can  name to make more money than this show  number three  stop relying on platforms to make you  rich it is only their job to make their  shareholders and their families Rich  from that product you're going to see  this happen too on Instagram Meta Even  for reals like all that they want you to  get 200 000 views to get a 700 payout  I'm like what  why I'll just go go get me 15 girls off  only fans like comment subscribe for  more and be done and make way more money  it is Fibonacci girls coming 2023  probably next week my guy hit me let's  make that happen  stop depending on platforms to make you  rich that is not their job to do so when  most of these tech companies cannot make  themselves rich  like if we have a real conversation  about taking out  large-scale Venture Capital investments  into most of these companies most of  them will not be able to  generate billions of dollars and some of  them are making billions of dollars and  still at a loss Snapchat at a loss  everyone put in chat what are like five  of the biggest tech companies that are  negative in Revenue the last three years  but they're publicly traded  got to be careful  please be careful the content game is  another Ponzi scheme too if I'm beat  they got y'all making even here 4K great  and you sell your whole oh let's talk  about linza and AI oh brilliant  brilliant I have that app  five years ago right  if you go through the terms and service  because I know everyone's saying well if  you're an artist you can take the AI to  make more art to sell your art here's  the crazy part any photo or derivative  that's what I have you load up 15 of  them they are able to sell all of your  Creations that you put into their site  in perpetuity  plus the lifetime of your children  without you making any money off of them  talk about a hell of a business model  like so let's talk about let's talk  about AI what are the two most  impromising features of AI that or  entrepreneurs are Implement in their  business before you do that I just clean  up the the YouTube thing so there was  some demonetization happening it was  really focused on Gamers and they were  looking at gaming content as a result  the policy is taking an issue with the  violence depicted in some video games  and more broadly and so they're losing  graphic video games that depict graphic  and dead bodies in a non-educational  video and Ultra graphic filing Acts  including those involving law  enforcement and injury so I'm thinking  like when people are going on YouTube  Call of Duty is one of those uh  even fortnite yeah that's right so  there's all these videos not to pick  that but there's also a new policy and I  would I suggest that people read it um  that the how the demonetization is going  to happen starting in uh well it started  at the end of last year so uh profanity  the rules have changed um and obviously  language and thumbnails thumbnails are  important to the viewership of videos  and so there's a whole new thumbnails  and titles and videos containing any  adult links I've seen language adult  material any sexually graphic acts um  are not going to receive Revenue there's  a whole list and maybe I'll I'll  screenshot this and put this in and  we'll put this up in the story or  something like that so people or let's  put it to the group text  or we could just do that as well yeah  yeah but it's good and if you're a  content creator you should know these  things I know everybody doesn't read the  rules and regulations or the terms but  it says it in here and so if you're  looking at your videos and wondering why  sometimes it's limited or not available  for monetization they obviously have  changed a little bit so good to know  I forgot man all right AI artificial  intelligence  uh okay this is here and I will say that  shot the 19 keys he gave us a dope um he  gave us a dope walk to actually set up a  a zoom call  with the team but on your leisure's team  and his team to give us  um best practices of how he's actually  been using artificial intelligence yep  and I won't I won't say everything  um but he definitely gave us some really  dope Insight on things that I wasn't  aware of as far as how you can have  articles written for you how you can  have  um  titles written for you you know um  thumbnails different things that nature  Made For You uh it was actually very  impressive and it was very interesting  um especially from a journalistic  standpoint I was very impressed with the  technology of how how I was writing  articles  um  so  I see a lot of benefit from there  especially and I'm sure a variety of  other different things but that's just  the first hand experience that you know  that happened pretty recently  uh so what's your thoughts on artificial  intelligence  I think two sides of a great I was  having a conversation with keys on live  I think the number one thing that Elon  needs to do with chat GPT is to have a  paid subscription for the top 10 000  influencers to have chat GPT create all  of  the tweeted content to make it go viral  um since now he's speaking can you can  you tell the people what chat gbt is it  is a  um AI company that allows you to write  articles headlines scripts even if you  want to like do outlines for shows like  we're going to see way more investing  content the top 10 lessons you need to  learn on investing from chat GPT right  so it Aggregates all the information and  it writes  um articles and information out for you  I think it's great but even at the core  of it a lot of what is missing is soul  and heart so you can have a list of 10  things but if you don't have real life  experience with it it's not going to hit  the same  um but if Elon of course bought Twitter  and he is an investor in chat GPT it  would be a great  Arbitrage play to tell influences hey  Instagram is dying slowly  um now use this and pay us a thousand a  month or three thousand a year and we'll  write all your tweets for you and allow  you to go viral and get more reach and  have ai do it for you that is a win at  some point that will be put into Tesla  software and I think will be a great  Advantage there and it will allow you to  scale the thing that it will not give  you go ahead  now I was going to say it's interesting  because the same things in the flows  that you're saying they're aware of it  so there was an article in the Wall  Street Journal about um chat GPT I know  some people like what was the letters g  uh PT they actually took a survey of  what people were saying about how the  platform is performing one of the things  that they said is like even when it's  automated right so it's a language it  actually uh optimizes language for you  it doesn't have an authentic feel to it  it still feels a little bit robotic so a  lot of people were creating their  resumes on there and it was it was I  mean it was crisp but it didn't have  authentic stories from it it was just  whatever you told it and so that thing  was like okay we're gonna go back now  and our new Venture is how do we add  that component to it and so they already  know the flaws and they're like all  right let's fix them before the the  general because I feel like even now  there's a majority of the population  probably doesn't know what it is yet  yeah but they will shortly right because  it's one of those things and I think the  most valuable thing and kind of what we  saw was like how it allows you  to get back your time right rather than  writing an article you can dictate a  sentence and it can create a four-page  article for you which obviously takes  back a lot of time for you from from an  automation standpoint so it's  interesting they're very aware of the  flows and they're like the same thing as  you just said and I was like wow that's  crazy that you said it because the  article is based on that like they know  what the performance flaws are they're  working on them right now which makes it  a easy acquisition talk because it's  really an SEO game it makes it a good  Target for Google to buy it and even  with that like I always say when  everyone was talking crypto and nft no  one was talking automation when I told  everyone by 2030 they want to have all  jobs automated 25 off of human beings  so look ahead because the thing that  they're pushing to you is not the next  wave like by the time they're pushing it  to you in your face they're already all  working on something else I think it  does give you scale but let's say  hypothetically you make a show and you  call it  Market Mondays part two and you write  all of your content in chat GPT what is  stopping Google from taking all the  information seeing the data the  analytics from that show and then going  to create it against you with actual  artificial intelligence because that's  not really  AI or skill that's like the consumer  version now the B2B and be the  government is different and way more  robust my fear as I Illustrated with  Linda a lot of people are going to try  to build their businesses off of  Automation and guess what because you  haven't read terms of service they have  rights to all of your information and  data and can they can now take your  information in Aggregate and use it  against you to put you out of business  and guess what there's nothing you can  do about it but you're gonna Sue Google  you're gonna Sue Elon does not work  automation is key but if you are not  building some of your own proprietary  software to keep that data in-house  that's why like I never Farm out when  it's time for me to call the numbers for  weather invest I never farmed it out  because I don't want it to get stolen or  sold off  if you're putting your best ideas up on  these platforms and they're charging you  300 a year  as we've seen with GameStop and Robin  Hood when they're selling that data who  are they taking that data and selling it  to why wouldn't Spotify come to chat GPT  and say I give you 100 million for every  lyric song that was written in there and  then if I get the AI robot to actually  work then it doesn't look like a buffoon  and I make this go crazy and we create a  digital Bad Bunny with all y'all right  now songs in here it's over with it  you can call me conspiracy theorists  they take the voice too just automate  the whole voice over yep  at scale  this robbery season right now man if  y'all not paying attention  this era is going to produce people that  make 50 and 80 and 100 million dollars  in like four or five years and then it's  going to be a class of people who are  just like broken destitute what side of  the coin you're going to be on are you  going to get rich and wealthy in this  area era from this information are you  gonna sit on the sidelines and complain  got to pick information  locks doors  my graduates from my school being Forbes  backdrop backdrop a mic drop
