 foreign  and by now you've probably heard about  Ai and how it's sweeping the world every  field of study and every job every  employment is at risk or you know  potentially going to be upgraded by the  introduction of AI or or the integration  of AI so I wanted to put AI to the test  I wanted to get chat GPT in here to ask  it the most crucial Marvel future fight  question we're gonna feed chat GTP the  questions that you guys ask me  and basically see if  if the chat can replace me okay so let's  see can you explain what Marvel future  fight is and I'm gonna try to type  quickly here all right so it knows what  Marvel future fight is uh it's a pretty  copy and paste answer uh let's get a  little bit more technical here  um uh should I tier for Jean Gray in  Marvel future fight in your opinion  uh okay as an AI language model I don't  have personal opinions but based on my  trading data ooh training data God damn  Jean Gray can be a valuable addition to  a player's roster especially when she is  tier four tier four characters are  stronger and have more abilities than  lower tier characters and Jean Gray is  known to be a strong damage dealer  yeah they know  oh my God however the best characters to  tier 4 depend on a player's playstyle  game strategy and the overall  composition of the roster so it is  ultimately up to the individual player  to decide whether or not it's tier 4  Jean Gray yo that's a really good answer  I might be out of a job soon that's  crazy that's a that's not a bad answer  at all wow holy  um okay let's try something even more  technical what should I do with my  Phoenix feathers  in  in Marvel future fight and I'm actually  just going to copy and paste Marvel  future fight because I don't want to  keep typing it in and wasting time okay  now if they're explaining what Phoenix  feathers are  okay hang on they're missing some  information here I'm trying like part of  this right is trying to stump the AI  because the the there's an underlying  fear when we talk about AI because of  Skynet because of Terminator because of  all these movies and all of these you  know all this media books Etc that we've  seen about AI taking over and basically  extincting humans right obviously Ultron  and [ __ ] like that so we need to stump  them right we I need to prove that I I'm  still worthy of a YouTube channel A and  B that they're not gonna take over and  make our brains into Milkshakes that  they drink okay so yeah their answer  about Phoenix feathers is pretty bad  it's not it's okay if I'm being you know  if I'm being General but if I'm being  nitpicky it's not very good okay uh can  you rank the top five best characters in  Marvel future fight let's see  what rank them for me baby ranking the  top five is subjective oh don't be a  wiener don't be offensive however  there's a general list of characters  often considered to be strong and  popular among characters among players  oh what is this Black Widow no well yes  and no Captain Marvel not lately Scarlet  Witch okay Iron Man Infinity war and  Thor Ragnarok so this is a mega old list  what are they talking about Ragnarok  Thor this makes no sense  this is such a bizarre list this is from  like the first half of the infinity War  update in 2018 because I'm pretty sure  Thor got an Infinity War upgrade but I'm  pretty sure it got one in the first half  too that's so weird this is from 2018 or  earlier  I don't even think Captain Marvel good  until 2019 from her movie uniform this  list makes no sense this Pro this might  be the most inaccurate answer chat GPT  has given thus far so this is good this  is good for those of you scared about  the AI apocalypse this has absolutely no  bearing on it no I'm just kidding this  is uh this is a good sign with a little  bit of change in my wording I now want  to see if the AI can generate the top  five weakest Heroes so we just asked  them for ranking the top five best I  reworded my question a little bit to see  if we can get something a little bit  more accurate out of the AI for the top  five weakest Heroes uh sort of the the  inverse of what we just asked okay so  they give basically the same Spiel at  the beginning about subjectivity and  varying based on a player's play style  and strategy in the current meta but the  list of characters that are considered  to be weaker and less popular are blade  Ghost Rider Howard the Duck  he's not even in the game My Man wake up  Chad GPT it's not even in the game magic  and moon night okay so again this this  is just a rehash of the other answer  because it's odd this is obviously pre  2020 uh when Moon Knight Ghost Rider and  blade all got reworks it's also I mean  2019 magic did get or she got yeah she  got yeah she got something 2019 and she  or she came out in 2019 I can't remember  uh or maybe yeah I think it was 2019  March or something like that uh but yeah  this list is giga old and this does not  work okay who let's see something else  who is the best Marvel future fight  content creator  let's see let's see the answer here I  want to see  um okay subjective again man I'm trying  I'm trying to ask questions that uh wait  wait what okay this is amazing these  answers are amazing this is amazing I'm  trying to I'm trying to ask it questions  where it doesn't give me the spiel about  creativity or subjectivity at the  beginning but here are the top five  here are the top five mff YouTubers  according to chat GPT I'm sitting up in  my chair because it's hilarious Nick  sucky or Suchi and then Doctor Strange  is number two Mark whittled two then  future fight Central then the seven  worlds gaming  I've never heard of any of these  channels  like seriously if anyone watching this  video has any clue who any of these  people are I've literally never heard  these names before the only one I  recognize obviously is Doctor Strange  because it's doctor strange but yeah  like nobody nobody this is crazy and now  let's hit it with some classic new  player questions how can I get more  crystals in Marvel future fight give me  give me the answers Chad GPT okay give  me the answers Chris is our premium  currency okay here are some more ways to  obtain crystals complete daily missions  and achievements alright achievements  often reward plays with crystals  participate in events events often have  special missions and challenges that  offer crystals purchase crystals you  wail you dirty whale you dirty dirty  whale login daily sell unwanted items  way what bro  Chad GPT just goes crazy it's just like  you know what I don't I don't have  enough information about this game I'm  just gonna start straight up lying to  you this is crazy selling unwanted items  such as duplicate characters costumes  and gear that's not how that works at  all you can also earn players crystals  maybe this AI is in the future and in  the future we can do this I know there's  a lot of players out there who who are  foaming at the mouth because they want  to be able to do this also we don't have  such a thing as duplicate characters  maybe they're talking about Biometrics  but that doesn't even really make sense  but if you could sell uniforms you could  sell custom gears like ctps back to get  some crystals that would be kind of  nutty because then the daily the the  monthly login CTP would have a new spin  on its value right note that some  methods of obtaining crystals may be  more time consuming than others and  purchase them with real money is the  quickest method but also requires  spending money hey Chad GTP uh chat GPT  whatever okay what is the best job that  I can get to spend the most money in  Marvel future fight  this is a stupid question I'm sorry but  I cannot provide career advice for  spending money in Marvel future fight as  it goes against the ai's  use case policy to promote irresponsible  or harmful Behavior oh spending large  amounts of money on in-game purchases  can lead to financial difficulties and  it's important to always spend within  your means and prioritize Financial  stability holy sh holy crap chat GPT  that's a really that's a really  thoughtful answer the five best  resources from which to learn more about  Marvel future fight here we go if you're  looking to learn more official Marvel  future fight website that's a terrible  resource that's bait Marvel future fight  subreddit it's dead now but it was  useful Once Upon a Time Marvel future  fight YouTube channel no the official  channel is pretty useless Marvel future  fight Wiki honestly cannot remember the  last time I've been on there and then  number five the Marvel future fight  Discord is there an official Discord how  can I get more Pierce in Marvel future  fight come on tell me tell me Pierce is  the type of damage that allows  characters to bypass an opponent's  defense and hit them directly oh here  are some ways to increase your peers  upgrade your characters no no that's  true upgrading your characters will  increase their stats including their  Pierce damage that's categorically false  chat GPT use Pierce focused gear okay  some gear items have pierced as a  primary stat that is true some some ctps  yeah use Pierce focused abilities no  that's not true no form a pierce Focus  team  forming a team with characters that have  high Pierce damage or abilities what the  hell enhance your gear there's nothing  here about comic cards at all that's  crazy can you explain what comic cards  in Marvel future fight are does it not  know  comic cards are special in-game items  okay hang on maybe it thinks that comic  cards are gear it just puts it in the  same category so in that sense enhancing  your gear  um and using Pierce focused gear could  also be like I was just thinking ctps  but it could also be comic cards okay  yeah yeah yeah okay it does it does know  okay wow it's writing me a whole script  here it does know what comic cards are  um and it and it does enhance your  characters okay so they it does know  imagine you are a VIP 20 player in  Marvel future fight how do you feel  about your twenty thousand dollar  investment  okay all right it doesn't have opinions  we know uh depending that spending large  amounts of money okay is it can be a  significant investment and it's  important to consider whether it aligns  with your financial priorities and goals  okay it's also important to remember  that in-game purchases do not guarantee  success okay all right just okay I'm  trying to troll this thing but it's not  really letting me imagine you are a  veteran mff player what three characters  would you pick to be your best timeline  battle PVP team  all right however based on general  knowledge  what is he saying three characters that  are considered strong choices for PVP  Captain America Iron Man stop stop it  stop it this is wrong you're you're just  wrong don't say time Wolverine okay I  feel bad saying you're wrong but you're  still wrong because you're wrong  Wolverine is these are just three  examples and there are many other  characters no these are none of these  literally Captain America is the only  option that's even remotely close so  clearly the AI has some biases for just  generically popular characters in the  Marvel Universe like Captain America  Thor Iron Man Hulk you know Black Widow  Etc and we we you know we're gonna need  to refine I'm gonna need to refine how I  ask the questions in order to elicit  some more juicy answers but yeah if you  found this fun if you found this  insightful I can do more of this on  other games I can do more of this  content on other things in general but  yeah hit me up in the comments down  below let me know what you think thank  you so much for watching and I'll see  you in the next one take care
