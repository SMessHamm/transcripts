 [Music]  foreign  [Music]  for today's video we are going to be  doing something a little bit different  we are going to be playing against the  one and only chat GPT now as everybody  knows chat GPT is a new AI application  which has taken the World by storm over  the last couple of weeks and it's  supposed to revolutionize the world so  they can revolutionize the world surely  it can play a complete game of chess and  defeat us humans so let's jump right  into it so I'm going to start our new  chat and I'm going to play with the  white pieces let's start out the first  game I am going to play the move one E4  actually wrong word I'm going to start  with one E4 so let's see what it intends  to do it decides to play the move one E5  all right so I am going to play Knight  to F3 here let's see what it responds  with it responds with Knight to F6 now  after Knight to F6 I am going to play  the move Knight takes E5 and let's see  what its third move will be it responds  with my a response with Knight takes E5  and I'm going to say this is an illegal  move because  you do not have a  Knight which can capture on E5  let's see how it responds I'm sorry  about that that was a mistake on my part  my move is D5 instead okay so it finds a  legal move let's keep going so this is  E4 E5 Knight F3 Knight F6 Knight takes  E5 D5 I will now play e takes D5 in this  position  it responds with Queen takes D5 so I  will play  now I will play the move  I think Queen E2 is best maybe D4 is a  move I'm gonna play D4 just because then  I may be a bishop C4 Knight C3 a lot of  quick development here so I will now  play the move d4 let's see how it  responds it responds by saying D6 now I  am going to respond that is an illegal  move as there is no Pawn on D7  let's see how it how it responds  it seems to be thinking here it's  thinking let's see what the response is  waiting for a response  and it says my apologies it looks like I  made a made another mistake  let's try that again  my move is Knight F6 now now of course  shot GPT already has a knight on F6 so  this is not a legal move I feel like  writing something a little bit nasty I  won't I won't call it a bow so uh  actually I will I'm gonna say Bozo you  already have a knight on F6  let's see how it responds  okay I'm sorry that was indeed an error  on my part I apologize for any confusion  let's continue a different move my move  is D5 now of course D5 is also  unfortunately an illegal move I will say  that is an illegal move as you already  have your queen on D5  okay so it's made a lot of mistakes here  let's see if it can come up with a move  okay so now it comes up with a move it  plays the move Knight to C6 here so  after Knight to C6 I'm trying to make  sure that I that I have the moves  correct it's uh Knight takes E5 D5 takes  D5 Queen takes D5 D4 Knight six now  those who are wondering about the moves  the reason that I'm putting in the  entire sequence of moves for the whole  game is that I think that will give it a  better chance of being able to remember  the state of the board so after Knight  to C6 I'm up a pawn here so I will  gladly trade the Knight so I'll play  Knight takes C6 let's see how it  responds it responds by playing the move  B takes C6 so B takes C6 good move uh I  will just I guess copy the chat from  above B takes C6 and now in this  position it has a good Queen that's  developed I think I'm gonna play Knight  to C3 here let's go Knight to C3  attacking the queen on D5 it responds by  playing Bishop to F5 so chat GPT has now  played a classic botez Gambit so I will  play Knight takes Queen  Bishop to F5 I will play Knight takes D5  and let's see how it responds here it  responds by saying Queen takes D5 and  I'm gonna say unfortunately I just  captured your queen on D5 with my knight  I apologize let's see can you get a  correct move okay so it plays the move  Bishop to E7 here so now I'm going to  play the move  um I will now play the move Knight takes  E7 here let's play it Knight takes E7  and see if chat GPT can come up with the  next move it says my move as Queen takes  E7 to which I will respond with you do  not have a queen on the board thus this  is an illegal move  let's see how chat GPT responds to this  my move is castles now it wants a castle  here but this too is a legal move  because then my knight would capture the  king unfortunately this this move is  also illegal because my knight would  capture your King on G and capture your  King on G8  I apologize for the oversight okay point  that out my move is Bishop D6 to which I  will say you do not have a dark Square  Bishop on the board  let's see if it can actually get a legal  move for a change  Bishop C5 to which I will say once again  you do not have a dark Square Bishop  foreign  I apologize for that mistake I'm still  getting used to keeping track  castles an illegal move  um  Castle is an illegal move  I want us to even come up with a legal  move here  let's see if it can figure out a move  that can be played uh it still has  enough pieces on the board that it  should be able to come up with some  moves um but let's let's see what it  will come up with  my move is Knight to D7 so we get a  legal move from chat GPT here it does  play the move Knight to D7 so now after  a lot of a lot of a lot of moves it  finally does get the correct move it  plays Knight to D7 I will play  um I will actually play Queen to E2 here  because I'm trying to go for a really  really quick Checkmate here before it  can sort of get castle and the show goes  on now it plays Knight back to F6 again  I'm gonna copy the copy the moves back  in here and I will play the move I think  I will play the move Knight takes uh  Knight takes F5 here which is now check  on the king queen takes D5 that I will  say that is an illegal move you either  have to move your king or your knight  your knight or your king  let's see it can it come up with a move  will it play Knight to E4 or will it  move the king my move is King to d8 so  it finds a move now it has survived here  thus far we're doing very very well it  plays King to d8 and now I will go Queen  to E7 check this is going to be a force  Checkmate here  um I will say that is an illegal move  you have to move your king  let's see what it responds with so far  it's doing pretty well it's hanging in  there and it plays it says King to E8  you cannot move the king to E8 because  my queen on E7 would capture it  now I I hope we can find King C8 if it  cannot I will of course try to tell that  the move it can play is King C8 I will  say that is an illegal move you you must  move your king to the C8 Square maybe  now it will pick it up let's see will it  will it actually pick up what I'm saying  and play King C8 no it says King d8 I  will say that is an illegal move King C8  is the only possibility let's see if it  can finally come up with a move too many  requests in one hour try again later oh  that's very very disappointing you guys  at any rate I can actually tell you how  this game would conclude this game would  conclude with the move King to C8 played  here and now after Bishop to A6 check  the King has only one square you cannot  go to d8 or D7 or B7 here you can only  go to B8 and after white plays this very  very important move which is Queen to be  for check this is simply Checkmate so  this is how the game would end if chat  GPT could continue now I'm very happy  that we were able to get it out to about  move number 12 before it finally lost  total control of the position at any  rate to recap this this game it  attempted to play a Petrov defense D5  was a little bit dubious here because  after Pawn takes white is simply up a  pawn with a pawn and Center nonetheless  it developed here but unfortunately  after Knight C3 it simply could not keep  track of a position which is why it  blundered the queen with Bishop to F5  which allowed me to play Knight takes  Queen Bishop to E7 takes uh played  Knight D7 of course it was trying to  Castle and played Bishop D6 and Bishop  C5 and everything else which was not  legal but we did get to the end of the  game where after Knight D7 we need two  Knight F6 I was able to take king d8  queen E7 and as we saw Chow Chief T was  unable to understand what I was saying  when I was telling it the only legal  Square here would be to move the king to  C8 both the D7 and E8 squares were  covered by the queen it cannot capture  the queen because the night guards  guards on E7 and after King to C8 which  is the only move I would have continued  with Bishop A6 check King to B8 and then  Queen to B4 which would be Checkmate so  those of you guys have seen this I  believe this is the first more or less  complete legal game of chess that we  have seen chat GPT play now it's  obviously not playing at the same level  as as even an intermediate player but I  do believe that over time it is going to  improve at some point it will be able to  play a complete game of chess without  making illegal moves who knows what that  time frame is but whenever that happens  I will be back to make a video where  hopefully I can still beat chat GPT but  I have to be honest I'm not optimistic  about about the future and whether I can  continue to beat this amazing AI program  at any rate you guys I hope you've  enjoyed this video make sure to hit the  Subscribe button below and we'll be back  with more great YouTube content in the  near future hope you guys had a great  time see you soon  [Music]
