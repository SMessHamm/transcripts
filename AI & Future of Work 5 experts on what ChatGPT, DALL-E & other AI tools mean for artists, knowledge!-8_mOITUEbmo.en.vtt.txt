 foreign  [Music]  five experts on what chat GPT daily and  other AI tools mean for artists and  knowledge workers this is on the  conversation  from steam power to an electricity to  computers at the internet  technological advancements have always  disrupted labor markets pushing out some  jobs while creating others artificial  intelligence remains something of a  misnomer the smartest computer systems  still don't actually know anything but  the technology has reached an inflection  point where it's poised to affect new  classes of jobs artists and knowledge  workers  specifically the emergence of large  language models AI systems that are  trained on vast amounts of text means  computers can now produce human sounding  written language and convert descriptive  phrases into realistic images  the conversation has five artificial  intelligence researchers to discuss how  large language models are making are  likely to affect artists and knowledge  workers and as our experts noted the  technology is far from perfect which  raises a host of issues from  misinformation to plagiarism and that  affects human workers to jump ahead to  each response here's a list of each  creativity for all but let loss of  skills  potential inaccuracies bias and  plagiarism  while with humans surpassed Niche and  handmade jobs will remain old jobs will  go new jobs will emerge leaps in  technology lead to new skills  creativity for all but lots of skills  Lynn Parker associate Vice Chancellor at  University of Tennessee large language  models are making creativity and  knowledge work accessible to all  everyone with an internet connection can  now use tools like chat GPT and Dale E2  to express themselves and make sense of  huge stories stores of information for  example producing text summaries  especially notable is a depth of  human-like language expertise large  language models displayed in just  minutes novices can create illustrations  for their business presentations  generate marketing pitches get ideas to  overcome writer's blog a block or  generate new computer code to perform  specific specified functions all at a  level of quality typically attributed to  human experts  these new I AI tools can't read minds of  course a new yet similar  simpler kind of human activity  creativity is needed in the form of text  problems to get the results the human  user is seeking  through iterative prompting an example  of human AI collaboration the AI system  generates excessive rounds of outputs  until the human writing the prompts is  satisfied with the results for example  the human women winner of the recent  Colorado State Fair competition in the  digital artist category who use an AI  power tool demonstrated creativity but  not of the sort that requires brushes  and an eye for color and texture  while there are significant benefits to  opening the world of creativity and  knowledge worked to everyone these new  AI tools also have downsides first they  could accelerate the loss of important  human skills that will remain important  in the coming years especially writing  skills educational institutes need to  craft and enforce policies unallowable  uses of large language models to ensure  fair play and desirable learning  outcomes  second these AI tools raise questions  around intellectual property protections  while human creators are regularly  inspired by existing artifacts in the  world including architecture and the  writings music and paintings of others  there are unanswered questions on the  proper and fair use by large language  models of copyrighted or open source  training examples  ongoing lawsuits are now debating this  issue which may have implications for  future design and use of large language  models  as Society navigates the implications of  these new AI tools  the public seems ready to embrace them  the chatbot chat GPT went virally  quickly viral quickly as did image  generator dial e mini and others this  suggests a huge untapped potential for  creativity and the importance of making  creative and knowledge work accessible  to all  the potential inaccuracies biases and  plagiarism  Danielle Acuna Professor associate  professor Computer Science University of  Colorado Boulder he said I'm a regular  user of GitHub capital a tool for  helping people write computer code and  I've spent countless hours playing with  chat GPT and similar tools for AI  generated text in my experience these  tools are good at exploring ideas that I  have not thought about before  I've been impressed by the model's  capacity to translate my instructions  into coherent text or code they are  useful for discovering new ways to  improve the flow of my ideas or creating  Solutions with software packages that I  did not know existed  once I see what these tools generate I  can evaluate their quality and edit  heavily overall I think they raise the  bar on what's considered creative but I  have several reservations  one set of problems is their  inaccuracies small and big with capital  and chat GPT I'm constantly looking for  whether ideas are too shallow for  example text without much substance or  insufficient code or output that is just  plain wrong such as wrong analogies or  conclusions or code that does not run  if users are not critical of what these  tools produce the tools are potentially  harmful  recently meta shut down its Galactica  large language model for scientific  tests text because it made up facts  about sounding very confident that  sounded very confident  the concern was that it could pollute  the internet with confident sounding  falsehoods another problem is biases  language models can learn from the  data's biases and replicate them these  biases are hard to see in the text  generation but very clear in image  generation models  researchers at open AI creators of chat  GPT have been relatively careful about  what the model will respond to by users  routinely find ways around these guard  rails  another problem is plagiarism  Recent research has shown that image  generation tools often plagiarize the  work of others  does that same happen with chat GTP  I believe that we don't know the tool  might be paraphrasing its training ideas  the data an advanced form of plagiarism  work in my lab shows that text  plagiarism detection tools are far  behind when it comes to detecting  paraphrasing  now these tools are in their infancy  given their potential for now I believe  that there are solutions to their  current limitations for example twos  could fact check generated texts against  knowledge bases use updated methods to  detect and remove balances from large  language models and Run results through  more sophisticated plagiarism detection  tools  with humans with humans surpassed Niche  and handmade jobs will remain  quintaro Toyama professor of Community  Information University of Michigan  he says we human beings love to believe  in our specialness but Science and  Technology have repeatedly proven this  conviction wrong people once thought  that humans were the only animals to use  tools to form teams or to propagate  culture that science has shown that  other animals do each of these things  meanwhile technology has quashed one by  one claims that cognitive task requires  a human brain the first adding machine  was invented in 1623 this past year  computer generated work won an art  contest I believe that the singularity  the moment when computers meet and  exceed human intelligence is on the  horizon  how will human intelligence and  creativity be valued when machines  become smarter and more creative than  the brightest people  there will likely be a Continuum and  some domains people still value humans  doing things even if a computer can do  it better it's been a quarter of a  century since IBM's deep blue beat world  champion Gary Kasparov but human chess  with all its drama has not gone away  in other domains human skill will seem  costly and extraneous take illustration  for example for the most part readers  don't care whether the graphic  accompanying a magazine article was  drawn by a person or a computer they  just wanted to be relevant new and  perhaps entertaining if a computer can  draw well  do readers care whether the credit line  says Marty gen or systemx illustrators  would be would but readers might not  even notice  and of course this question is not black  and white many fields will be a hybrid  whereas some homo sapiens find a lucky  Niche but most of the work is done by  computers think manufacturing much of it  today is accomplished by robots but some  people oversee the machines and there  remains a market for handmade products  if history is any guide it's almost  certain that advances in AI will cause  more jobs to vanish that creative class  people with human-only skills will  become richer but fewer in number and  that those who own creative technology  will become the New Mecca Ridge if  there's a silver lining it might be that  when even more people are without a  decent livelihood people might muster  the political will to contain runaway  inequality  old jobs will go new jobs will emerge  Mark Finley associate professor computer  science Florida International University  says large language models are  sophisticated sequence completion  machines give one a sequence of words  like I would like to eat and and it will  run likely completions Apple  large language models like chat GPT that  have been trained on record-breaking  numbers of words trillions have  surprised many including many AI  researchers with how realistic extensive  flexible and content sensitive their  completions are  like any powerful new technology that  automates a skill in this case a  generation of coherent albeit somewhat  generic text it will affect those who  offer that skill in the marketplace  to conceive of what might happen it's  useful to recall the impact of the  introduction of word processing programs  in the early 1980s certain jobs like  type is almost completely disappeared  but on the upside anyone with a personal  computer was able to generate well-type  set documents with ease broadly  increasing productivity  further new jobs and skills appeared  that were previously unimaginable like  the oft included resume item MS office  and the market for high-end document  production remains becoming much more  capable sophisticated and specialized  I think this same pattern will almost  certainly hold for large language models  they will no longer be a need for you to  ask other people to draft coherent  generic text on the other hand large  language models will enable new ways of  working and also lead to new and as yet  unimagined jobs  to see this consider just three aspects  where large language models fall short  first it could take quite a bit of human  cleverness to craft a prompt that gets  uh desired output minor changes in the  prompt can result in a major change in  the output  second large language models can  generate inappropriate or nonsensical  output without warning  third as far as AI researchers can tell  large language models have no abstract  General understanding of what's true or  false if something is right or wrong and  what is just common sense notably they  cannot do relatively simple math this  means that their output can unexpectedly  be misleading biased logically faulty or  just plain false  these failings are opportunities for  creative and knowledge workers for much  content creation even for General  audiences people will still need the  Judgment of human creative and knowledge  workers to prompt guide collate curate  edit and especially augment machines  output  many types of specialized highly  technical language will remain Out Of  Reach of machines for the foreseeable  future and there will be new types of  work for example those who will make a  business out of fine-tuning In-House  large language models to generate  certain specialized types of texts to  serve particular markets  in some  although large language models certainly  pretend disruption for Creative  knowledgeable workers there are still  many valuable opportunities in the  offing for those willing to adapt and to  integrate these powerful new tools  leaps in technology lead to new skills  this is by Casey Green Professor by  biomedical informatics University  Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus saying  technology changes the nature of work  and knowledge work is no different the  past two decades have been have seen  biology and Medicine undergoing  transformation by rapidly advancing  molecular characteristics such as fast  inexpensive DNA sequencing and the  digitization of medicine in the form of  apps  telemedicine and data analysis some  steps since technology feel larger than  others  Yahoo deployed human curators to index  emerging content during the dawn of the  World Wide Web the Advent of algorithms  that use information embedded in the  linked patterns of the web to prioritize  results radically alter the landscape of  search transforming how people gather  information today  the release of open ai's chat GPT  indicates another leap chat GPT wraps a  state-of-the-art large language model  tuned for chat into a highly usable  interface it puts a decade of Rapid  progress in artificial intelligence at  people's fingertips and this tool can  write passable cover letters and  instruct users on addressing common  problems in user-selected language  styles  just as the skills for finding  information on the internet change with  the Advent of Google the skills  necessary to draw the best outfit from  language models will Center on creating  prompts and prompt templates that  produce desired outputs  for the cover letter example multiple  prompts are possible write a cover  letter for a job would produce a more  generic output then write a cover letter  for position as a data entry specialist  the user could craft even more specific  prompts by pasting portions of the job  description resume and Specific  Instructions for example highlighting  attention to detail  as with many technological advances how  people interact with the world will  change in the era of widely accessible  AI models the question is whether  Society will use this moment to advance  Equity or exacerbate disparities  this is how the conversation by lime  Parker associate Vice Chancellor
