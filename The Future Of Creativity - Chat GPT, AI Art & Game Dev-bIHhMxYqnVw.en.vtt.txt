 hey what's up guys so there is a lot  going on right now chat GPT is buzzing a  lot of AI talk so I wanted to give my  take on it from a game devs perspective  and talk about the implications on the  creative Pursuits such as Game Dev and  art in general because they are quite  staggering so if you have no idea what  I'm talking about let me quickly get you  up to speed so a few weeks ago open AI a  company at the Forefront of AI  engineering and the creators of the Dali  AI art generation tool released an open  Beta to their chat GPT artificial  intelligence interface and it has  absolutely blown people away it's a  sophisticated and at times overconfident  chat bot which understands plain  language input that is to say you can  talk to it as you would a normal person  unlike a search engine where you have to  kind of type keyword Centric of queries  this you can have have a dialogue with  and it'll give you natural responses  it's absolutely wild it's a complex  neural network that Taps into the vast  compendium of human knowledge and  language and it learns it's capable of  giving basic answers to simple questions  all the way through to exchanging deep  philosophical ideas on complex topics it  can write content it can write scripts  essays book chapters and you can mimic  the styles of different authors it can  help design games it can help you write  code and organize your architecture you  can essentially ask it to provide you  with any info you want in any kind of  formatting to try to list even a  fraction of the things it can do would  be to do it a disservice it's quite  remarkable indeed in a short time this  chat GPT beta has been available the  platform has grown quicker than that of  Facebook and that is really saying  something this technology is about to  disrupt a whole lot of markets and  industries and potentially even human  culture as we know it a bit of a  Pandora's Box because it's such a  powerful Competitive Edge in the right  hands and you cannot do away with  competitive edges once they're known to  the public that's it and if you are a  creative in any of the creative  disciplines whether it's content  creation YouTube game development game  design  art creation then you need to be well  aware of this I've already seen  um notable YouTubers creating complete  scripts using this bot system where you  say basically like hey give me the  script for the best YouTube video that  has a high chance for being viral  um you know on this topic and that topic  but this is only an early version and  I've been told the next version is  around the corner which is supposedly  going to be 500 times more robust I  can't even comprehend what that even  looks like I mean it's pretty impressive  now so to say something's going to be  magnitudes of order a more sophisticated  we had a bit of a Crossroads here you  could say a Crossroads for Humanity even  I'm predicting within years we're all  going to be tapped into a form of system  like this this system  is basically going to make conventional  websites and blogs and things like that  obsolete why would you go to Google  and you know make a search query then  have to filter for all these different  websites ads popping up in your face and  all this stuff when you can just ask  this system the question and it'll give  you the best possible answer based on  all the content aggregation available  it's going to change the way we interact  with the online space for sure  and it's a very powerful tool if we're  leveraged correctly so let's talk about  the implications on the creative arts  such as Indie Dev and Game Dev in  general you see this system can help you  make games you know I've joked with  friends in the past years ago we would  say you know like imagine one day  there's a system where you can press a  button and it will make a game  so we are not there yet  but we are a step closer to that  strange reality dystopian Game Dev so  Chachi BT can assist you with game  design  you know you can ask it give me  100 ideas for an indie game  in this genre or that genre and it'll do  it for you it'll give you that  information and then you can say okay  well I like this particular idea write  me a game Loop  design me a level give me give me more  info and it will be as detailed as you  ask it to be so within uh you know  minutes or hours having a conversation  with this system you can come up with a  complete Game design document now  naturally uh you know you'll need to be  a  skilled game designer to know if it's  been correct or not it needs some  oversight however if you do have those  skills this system can benefit you  greatly for your programming this could  be very effective because  you can ask it for Concepts design  patterns say you can you can ask it um  well you know I have an inventory system  that I have this many items how would I  you know go about designing the  architecture for this and it'll give you  a comprehensive breakdown of you know  what are the practices you might want to  consider very impressive very impressive  but obviously um you know programming is  is a complex  discipline that is not so easy to  replace but the system can create basic  scripts in various languages and  YouTuber Ben Bonk recently created a  video documenting the creation of the  minigame purely using the chat gpt3  outputs now the scripts that were  provided were often you know problematic  with strange decisions made but it was  interesting to say the least you know  within a year or two years what does  that look like nobody knows at this  point you know nobody knows and then we  have ai art  artwork is of course a big part of game  design concept art  background art character design  all these things have already been  massively impacted by AI generated art  stable diffusion Dali mid-journey just  to name a few of the AI generation  systems for artwork now I know people  who are already using these systems to  generate artwork for their games and  it's very impressive this is good art  exceptional art in some cases but it's  interesting you know where does that go  because it needs artists to get the  source material from  so if that Source material was to dry up  the art would effectively never really  change all the AI generator art would  kind of start to look the same because  it all uses the same Source material now  that might not be so evident now but  over time we would learn to have an eye  for what is probably AI generated art  and that will affect stylistically you  know and culturally what is considered  aesthetic art you know as people will  try to move away from anything that  might resemble AI art so that's  interesting that would be a big shift in  human culture because art is such an  integral part of human culture now you  can imagine the implications of this  technology for solo indie game  developers like myself or people that  don't necessarily have an eye for art or  aren't trained in art or don't have the  budget to hire an artist it may  ultimately determine how your game looks  because you know if you're using this  tool you have to work within the  confines of the results so here we have  an indie developer who's been doing the  rounds on various news Publications  because they built this kind of fairly  simple shmup but it was fully made with  AI art and it's quite impressive what  they did it's not necessarily you know  award-winning art by any means but it's  coherent and the fact they didn't have  to draw any of it is quite remarkable  [Music]  very impressive you know like they  basically bypassed the need for having  an artist  so that's a problem for artists right  because a lot of people make their  livelihood from creating artwork so here  is another case where an AI generated  artwork won first place at a fine art  State Fair in America you can see here  an AI generated artwork one first place  at a state fair uh Fine Arts competition  and artists are pissed but I mean yeah  it looks kind of cool right and this  probably took him you know a few minutes  to generate so also had a look at what  other things people were coming up with  this was in the public repository of  artwork people had generated different  concepts each and every one of these  images is unique it's completely unique  and you can keep pressing the refresh  button in these systems and you'll keep  spitting out more and more variations so  concept art is probably going to be hit  the hardest by this so let's jump in and  see what we can do quickly give me  10 ideas for an RPG video game  boom  sure  look at that  so that's pretty cool we've got you know  10 fairly good ideas a game set in a  world inspired by Norse mythology where  the player can choose to be a warrior  Mage and you can say okay  tell me more about nine  and then he will flesh it out even  further  then when will I say what game systems  might it have  so that there should be more than enough  to both amaze and terrify you depending  on which side of this you're on now if  you're a skilled game designer you're  going to be like holy crap yep the  market is already so saturated and now  it's going to become a whole lot more  saturated so here is the crazy part  mid-journey Dali you have to give it  inputs so you can now go to chat gpt3  and ask it to give you inputs that are  compatible with those art programs  so you get a full circle of content  creation now but one thing I've noticed  with these systems as a game designer  myself  is that  the responses these systems give  are a little bit warded down they're a  little bit vague and diluted they're not  really that Punchy they're very generic  in a sense  they kind of miss that  that spark that surprise or mystery it's  very predictable in a way so this is  fine if you're just making like um you  know simple stuff but if you're trying  to do something really impactful and  meaningful  it may not really work out although it  can still be used as a foundation and  then you can add that surprise and  mystery on top that's what kind of makes  art art you know it's this  um  there is an Essence there rather  ineffable but it's it's surprise  vulnerability and a potential for  failure you know and you take that away  it's not really art it's artistic but  it's not art as we kind of Define uh  culturally  but maybe you can code that in too right  maybe you can code in Surprise code in  this human Essence we'll see so how  impactful will this technology  ultimately be on the market and Industry  as a whole many have already said that  this is the equivalent of the Gutenberg  printing press Revolution which  completely changed the world and how  information was disseminated if everyone  has this in their pocket  this is going to essentially change the  world now if they put this behind a  paywall which they very well might  you know I imagine people would pay  thousands of dollars a year to have  this technology at their disposal  because it's such a competitive  Advantage there's an ethical way to use  this technology and a very um dubious  underhanded way to use it as well  depending on what you're trying to do  so you can just imagine a lot of get  rich quick schemes already being hatched  around this technology there is a  natural inclination to be afraid of  these things because it's such a big  change and I myself had an anxiety when  I realized the implications of this  after chatting with this system  from multiple hours last night it was  like a rabbit hole man I just kept on  going oh my God this thing can so start  thinking about how these Technologies  can be plugged into your life to make  your life more efficient but I encourage  you to try to remain ethical with these  things because there is a dark path  potentially before us if enough people  use it in the wrong way you can just  imagine how many YouTubers and content  creators in the video space are going to  start using this technology to churn Out  video scripts and things like that there  is a combination of  different sentiments going around at the  moment some are thrilled they're like  hey this is like great we can leverage  this others are falling into a state of  despair  and understandably because it's  encroaching on your skills and creative  space and I can understand that however  this technology is not going away this  is only the surface and it's only going  to get more widespread and integrated  into our markets and life  so look at it as an opportunity embrace  it and start coming up with ways that  you can utilize this technology to  benefit your life and your creative  expression use it in tandem with your  creativity to elevate it not to destroy  it that's my advice to you I had a  conversation with a friend who was like  look  the style of art I do is basically at  odds clashing with this stuff  you know the systems are essentially  pulling his artwork from the database  and you know using it  and he's like I can't compete with this  you know these artworks take me weeks to  make and all of a sudden people are just  making it like that and you can tweak  things on the Fly very quickly you can  go into a board room with a concept art  and the art director will say ah you  know can we change the arms or the armor  see in a conventional setting the artist  would have to go back and spend all day  making these changes but now you can do  it in the boardroom without leaving you  know you can just make a bunch of word  changes and get a whole new Direction  that's incredible both a threat and an  opportunity think of this technology as  a personal assistant that will alleviate  the bottlenecks in your workflow and let  you focus on what it is that you  actually enjoy doing getting rid of all  the mundane boring stuff that you may  not actually even be good at allowing  you to really focus on the fun stuff and  helping you to bring that Finish Line a  bit closer faster I think that's a fair  way to look at it so you don't have to  like feel threatened necessarily that  this is going to take away the stuff  that you enjoy doing you can continue to  do that you know but this kind of plug  this on and enhance the whole process  basically and that all sounds great but  when you have a low barrier to entry in  any field what you get is people who  just want to make money who have no  interest in the craft or creative  expression like all these people making  these videos AI art prints money yeah  it's a money printer you know sell a IR  to 300 a day make money  money money money money money money  money  money  okay and that's where it all falls down  and I'm not at all surprised all these  art station  um users holding protests and boycotting  AI art which has been infiltrating their  platform you need to keep it a little  bit challenging because you want  people to be committed and dedicated to  the craft because that yields the best  results one of the reasons I like  gameniff personally is because it's  challenging I like the challenge if you  take that challenge away I'm not sure  I'll be that interested in game  development and I might be inclined to  move to a different creative field or  discipline  so it's a catch-22 accessibility is cool  up until a point so you have to kind of  balance that out so these Technologies  they can take us over that Tipping Point  where it just opens the floodgates where  people are rolling out of bed it's just  going hey let's make some money and that  distance the whole market so yeah a bit  of a balance is required very quickly  you can get a race to the bottom and  we've seen this happen in the mobile app  stores which started out really cool and  really Innovative then over time just  became governed by corporate interests  who've started churning out this  repetitive games Clash of whatever  something Crush every thumbnail starts  to look the same some character with his  mouth open screaming it's not great for  consumers because they're just getting  fed the same old gruel day after day so  I'd love to get a conversation going  about this let me know down below what  do you think about this technology do  you think it'll be as disruptive as I  have mentioned or do you think you know  it may take a different path what do you  think about it overall are you afraid of  it do you embrace it do you think it  even should have been created is this a  good direction for Humanity and where  will it take us in you know 10 20 years  as this thing matures because that's  where the big question is right right  now it's one thing but you continue down  this trajectory where will it be in 50  years so this is a bold new future we  are stepping into you know it's a hell  of a way to start the new year so  anyways I hope you've enjoyed this video  and the information if you have please  do give it a like drop a sub if you  haven't already and I'll see you all in  the next video bye  thanks for watching guys I hope you  enjoyed the video if you did please do  drop a like and thanks to all my patreon  supporters I appreciate you guys so much  [Music]
