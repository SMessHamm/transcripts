 in what ways will chat GPT contribute to the&nbsp; evolution of our society over the next few&nbsp;&nbsp; years here are some Concepts to consider one it is&nbsp; possible that robots with human level artificial&nbsp;&nbsp; intelligence will begin to emerge within the next&nbsp; several years language models such as Chad GPT May&nbsp;&nbsp; acquire human level intelligence or at the very&nbsp; least get extremely close to achieving this goal&nbsp;&nbsp; it is possible that in the near future high-end&nbsp; humanoid robots that are capable of carrying&nbsp;&nbsp; on conversations on par with humans will be&nbsp; widespread even the sounds that were manufactured&nbsp;&nbsp; by their AI were able to sound very realistic to&nbsp; us in addition to this it is likely that virtual&nbsp;&nbsp; characters will appear in virtual reality settings&nbsp; equipped with the same capabilities by the year&nbsp;&nbsp; 2035 these kinds of AIS may have developed into&nbsp; artificial general intelligences which are capable&nbsp;&nbsp; of carrying out every intellectual work that&nbsp; a human being is capable of carrying out Eric&nbsp;&nbsp; Schmidt a former CEO of Google is likewise&nbsp; of the opinion that at least one artificial&nbsp;&nbsp; general intelligence could come into being by&nbsp; the year 2035 2. virtual assistants comparable&nbsp;&nbsp; to Jarvis might become standard practice in the&nbsp; future it's possible that chat GPT will pave the&nbsp;&nbsp; way for virtual assistants as early as this year&nbsp; in addition these digital helpers will become&nbsp;&nbsp; astonishingly more lifelike over the course of&nbsp; time they may help you succeed in job interviews&nbsp;&nbsp; say all the appropriate things on dates find the&nbsp; ingredients for food recipes at grocery shops and&nbsp;&nbsp; assist you in navigating a strange place in the&nbsp; near future we will be able to access them through&nbsp;&nbsp; a variety of devices including augmented reality&nbsp; glasses smart speakers smartphones and more if&nbsp;&nbsp; we tell them our aims and objectives they might&nbsp; even recommend different strategies goods and&nbsp;&nbsp; services that will assist us in achieving those&nbsp; goals the more you engage with their suggestions&nbsp;&nbsp; through a system of upvotes and downvotes the more&nbsp; accurate their recommendations will become over&nbsp;&nbsp; time three it's possible that most search engines&nbsp; will include results generated by AI the majority&nbsp;&nbsp; of the main search engines including Google have&nbsp; the capability of including AI generated results&nbsp;&nbsp; which would be displayed in parallel with the&nbsp; highest ranking web pages users would be able&nbsp;&nbsp; to have a better well-rounded understanding of&nbsp; almost any subject imaginable as a result of&nbsp;&nbsp; this 4. the production of movies and shows will&nbsp; become a great deal less difficult integration&nbsp;&nbsp; of language models into art generators created by&nbsp; I will continue to become more prevalent in the&nbsp;&nbsp; future language models have the potential&nbsp; to not only make the process of creating&nbsp;&nbsp; scripts more efficient and eliminate writer's&nbsp; block but they also have the potential to give&nbsp;&nbsp; real-time development of storyboards for each&nbsp; scene they could also offer films photographs&nbsp;&nbsp; and virtual environments to provide us with a&nbsp; clear a picture of how the characters and the&nbsp;&nbsp; worlds in which they live should appear visually&nbsp; 5. there is considerable room for improvement in&nbsp;&nbsp; education Concepts and areas of studies such as&nbsp; mathematics history and physics could be better&nbsp;&nbsp; understood by students with the assistance&nbsp; of language models from virtually every angle&nbsp;&nbsp; imaginable people will be able to further expand&nbsp; their comprehension by gaining access to films&nbsp;&nbsp; photos and 3D assets that were made by AI after&nbsp; these AIS are integrated with a IR generators&nbsp;&nbsp; this could result in a discernible rise in exam&nbsp; scores across the board in every country where&nbsp;&nbsp; people have access to the internet 6. it's&nbsp; possible that chat Bots used in businesses&nbsp;&nbsp; will become 10 times more effective on company&nbsp; websites chat Bots could provide individualized&nbsp;&nbsp; responses to every inquiry on a company's&nbsp; products in response to each individual&nbsp;&nbsp; interaction it is possible that you will feel&nbsp; as though you are conversing with an actual and&nbsp;&nbsp; employee of the organization 7. the pace at&nbsp; which software is developed might be able&nbsp;&nbsp; to pick up it is possible that most aspects of&nbsp; software development such as computer-generated&nbsp;&nbsp; imagery CGI for movies and video games may become&nbsp; increasingly automated the majority of software&nbsp;&nbsp; development projects have the potential to&nbsp; have their cycle times reduced by at least&nbsp;&nbsp; 10 percent 8. artificial intelligences could be&nbsp; an incredible resource for mental health support&nbsp;&nbsp; if a person gives language models sufficient&nbsp; information about their life such as their&nbsp;&nbsp; goals their challenges and how they are feeling&nbsp; at the moment the language models may present&nbsp;&nbsp; the person with an altogether fresh viewpoint on&nbsp; the journey that is their life they might offer&nbsp;&nbsp; an infinite number of ways for them to achieve&nbsp; their objectives an infinite number of answers&nbsp;&nbsp; to the challenges they are currently confronted&nbsp; with and an infinite number of perspectives on&nbsp;&nbsp; life that are more upbeat and positive these&nbsp; artificial intelligences have the potential&nbsp;&nbsp; essential to make people feel more enthusiastic&nbsp; positive and upbeat about life in general 9.&nbsp;&nbsp; social media Bots May soon be able to compete with&nbsp; humans in some areas the use of human level bots&nbsp;&nbsp; on social media platforms could give users with&nbsp; new opportunities for learning and entertainment&nbsp;&nbsp; these platforms are owned and operated by social&nbsp; media businesses soon businesses and individuals&nbsp;&nbsp; will be able to develop and distribute their own&nbsp; known sophisticated Bots that can do a range of&nbsp;&nbsp; tasks when this occurs the level of inaccurate&nbsp; information that may be found on the internet&nbsp;&nbsp; May reach previously in reachable Heights 10. the&nbsp; use of language models might be able to assist us&nbsp;&nbsp; in the creation of new technologies Sam Alton&nbsp; the Chief Executive Officer of open a asserts&nbsp;&nbsp; that chacht is unable to generate new information&nbsp; or knowledge however within the next 5 to 15 years&nbsp;&nbsp; this could completely shift when language models&nbsp; and similar systems gain additional capabilities&nbsp;&nbsp; they may be used to construct quantum computers&nbsp; Aid in the discovery of remed cities for diseases&nbsp;&nbsp; make it possible for humans to live longer and&nbsp; assist in the creation of speedier spaceships&nbsp;&nbsp; as these artificial intelligences get more&nbsp; generic and begin to reach super intelligence&nbsp;&nbsp; this problem is only going to become more&nbsp; widespread thank you for watching and we&nbsp;&nbsp;
