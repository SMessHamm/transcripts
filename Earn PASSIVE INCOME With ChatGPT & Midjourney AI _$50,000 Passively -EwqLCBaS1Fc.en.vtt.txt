 this simple storybook for kids made over  one hundred thousand dollars in passive  income on Amazon so in this video I want  to show you guys how you can do the same  thing how you can use AI tools to create  storybooks and upload them on Amazon and  make money online the only thing that I  want to ask you guys in return is to  press that like button and subscribe if  you want to see future videos on how to  make money online so yesterday I was  having fun on Amazon and looking for  different things to buy then for some  reason I stumbled on storybooks for kids  and what actually blew my mind is how  much money in passive income you can  make from these ebooks or storybooks for  kids and actually it is really easy to  create them so for example you can see  this storybook they have  5391 ratings and this is only probably  10 percent of the people or even less  than 10 percent that left rating so if  you go and calculate for example  5391 times 11 which is actually the  price of this storybook that is 59 300  in passive income so in this video I  want to explain you guys how you can go  and actually create these story books  for kids publish them on Amazon and get  money with zero investment so this is  something really crazy as I said because  you don't need any special skill and for  example you can see this one has  7256 ratings again this is not all the  people that bought the ebook but if we  only calculate the people that left the  rating times five dollars and ninety  five cents you can see this one has made  over forty three thousand dollars and  again again this is only people that  left the rating probably less than 10  percent of the people that bought this  ebook  you can see there are tons of different  ones and as I said you don't need any  investment to publish this uh these  story books and also you don't need any  investment to create them you can  actually use chat GPT and AI tools to  create the storybook for kids in just  less than 20 minutes so I'm going to  show you guys exactly how to do it so  you can go and create these storybooks  go on KDP on Amazon and self-publish  these books you can see right here you  can go and publish them in less than  five minutes and appear on Kindle  stories worldwide in 72 hours you can  also earn 75 70 sorry percent of  realities of the sale so this means that  you're not going to get all 100 of the  profit so for example if you sell ebook  for ten dollars you're going to get  seven dollars and three dollars is going  to come to Amazon so you're going going  to have this split but Amazon is  providing you with the customers because  they already have millions of people  coming to their website and you're not  going to really lose that much money for  providing for Amazon that is providing  you this service so I want to explain  you guys how easy it is to create these  story books so first thing that you want  to do is you want to go on chat GPT now  it is really easy to create your 100  free chat GPT account and if you are  living under the rock you and if you  don't know what is chat GPT it is  basically AI where you can ask any  questions give any tasks and chat GPT is  going to provide you with answers or  whatever you actually need so just go on  open AI create your 100 free account and  once you log in it is going to look like  this now you can go and shoot choose the  dark mode or light mode I actually like  this light mode now what we need to do  is we need to create title for storybook  for kids so we want to say to chat GPT  to create us a title or storybook for  kids  and you want to press enter or click on  this button right here and it is going  to take some time for a chat GPT to  provide you us with storybook titles so  for example the adventures or spark  Sparky and friends so this is a pretty  decent storybook name and you can go and  say for example write me  five more and chat GPT is going to  create you different variations or  different uh different titles for your  ebook so for example we want to choose  the random one we don't want to go with  this first one we want to make this a  little bit complicated so so for example  we are going to go with this type of The  Curious Case of missing treasure so we  want to copy this name of this ebook and  we want to now say create chapter create  chapters page outline  4 and put the name of storybook  and we want to click on enter so what is  going to happen now is chat GPT is going  to provide us with step-by-step chapters  that we want to create our storybook so  this is going to be really useful for us  because we are now going to use these  chapters to actually create a storybook  so I'm going to show you guys how it is  easy to do so first thing that we want  to do now is you want to go and copy the  chapter one so we want to create a small  Story We for this chapter one The  Mystery Map so we want to copy this name  and we want to say for example name of  the chapter I'm going to put for example  at the whole chapter one and I'm going  to add write  write them story and what is going to  happen now is chat GPT is going to  create us the chapter one story for our  storybook and this is really useful  because now we can use this for our  storybook and as I said it is really  easy to do we just want to let AI create  everything for us that we actually need  now next thing this is really important  what you want to do is you want to go  now and read this text you don't just  want to blindly copy and paste you want  to go and read find if this is a good  story and then if something is for  example not understanding or it is hard  to read or you feel like it is not the  best option you want to say chat GPT to  write another story so this is really  easy to do just make sure to tell chat  GPT to write it over and over and over  again till you find the best best one so  this is something that the only thing  that you need to work on is you need to  read the story find out if it's good if  it's not good just make sure to find uh  the one that is shooting your chapter so  I'm not going to read right now because  I don't want to waste your guys time I'm  going to just go and create now images  for our storybook so it is going to cost  you probably thousands of dollars to pay  some influencer or to pay someone else  to create this content but if you go on  a midi Journey this is another AI tool  you probably heard about it this is a  really crazy AI tool where you can give  prompts to this mid-journey AI tool and  they're going to create images from your  text I'm going to show you guys this  software in action because this is  something because this is actually  something really mind-blowing for me so  if you go and click on join the beta  you're going to see page like this so  you need to download Discord and once  you download Discord you're going to see  a page that looks like this now it is  going to be everything is going to be  done on Discord and you can give prompts  to a mid journey and they're going to  create images for you for example you  can so you can see this guy is giving  prompts to create mini a dino cute uh  baby love tweens flowers and so on so  you can see what is the end result  this is really crazy because they  provide you guys with high quality  images and you can go just and type in  whatever is on your mind and meat  journey is going to come with it you can  see a kitchen with long uh Island and so  on beer and you can see that mid-journey  created this so this is something really  mind-blowing uh I'm using mid Journey a  lot because as I said you can create  images from thin air just by giving the  text  so what I'm going to do right now is I'm  going to create our storybook image so  how I'm going to do that I'm going to  write a slash and I'm going to click on  this imagine and prompt so I need prompt  for my ebook so I'm going to come back  on chat GPT and I'm going to paste for  example on the trail of to Treasure  so I'm going to copy this chapter and  I'm going to paste it right here so what  is going to happen it is going to take  some time of course for Mid journey to  generate as image you can see it says  wait to start so it is going to take  probably around two or minutes or one  minute to create our image you can see  it started creating for us it is zero  percent right now and after it is  finished I'm going to come back and show  you guys the results of this image so it  actually took us a little bit less than  30 seconds for AI to generate this crazy  crazy image now what you can do is you  can go and choose different variations  of these images if you don't for example  like any from this free so you can see  this first one is something I like this  the second one I actually don't like  this third one is really great and I  like this fourth one so for example if  you want to choose which image you want  to download now you want to for example  if you want first one you want to click  on this U1 so the chat this mid Journey  AI tool is going to give you guys the  Solo image only of this one but if you  want variations you want to click on V1  so chat sorry not chat GPT mid journey  is going to provide you with variations  on this first image so it really depends  on what you actually need and what you  actually want so for example I want the  image of this third one and I'm going to  click on you free just to show you guys  in action so it is going to again take  some time probably around few seconds to  generate and upscale our third image so  once it is done I'm going to again come  back and show you guys the results  so it actually took us a little bit  longer than one minute I didn't expect  that but you can see the final product  of our image so what we can do now is we  can just go right click and click on  save image and now we have downloaded  the image on our desktop now what is  going to happen now is you want to go  and create for each chapter you want to  create nine different images and you get  the point how to do it it is really  simple to do if you have any questions  feel free to ask in comments down below  and I'm going to try to help you guys so  you want to go again say imagine put the  name of the chapter one as prompt and  you want to see which image you actually  like so once it is done I'm going to  come back again and show you guys the  results and you can see the final result  of our map for our chapter one so if you  don't like for example any of this you  want to go and type in right here to get  or to generate another four Images now  if you want to for example variation of  this fourth one make sure to click on V4  but I actually like this fourth one so  what I'm going to do is I'm going to  upscale or create the only single image  of this fourth one so I'm going to click  on Q4 right here and again it is going  to take some time for Midi journey to  generate our image probably around again  one minute or so so once it is done I'm  going to come back and show you guys the  final product finally you can see it  took us around one minute or so again to  generate this beautiful image now what  you want to do is you want to right  click save again and you want to repeat  this over and over again till you create  all the images for all nine chapters now  once you're done with this you want to  use another free software called canva  now this is another software that you  can use to create different stuff but  what I'm going to do is I'm going to  create storybook so I'm going to search  for storybooks and I want to click on  this storybook first one now they're  going to give you guys different options  different templates but we actually  don't need anything please the reason  why is because we already have our  images and we already have everything we  need for our storybook now what you want  to do is you want to go and click on  this upload upload button right here now  what you want to do is you want to go  and click on this upload button right  here and click on upload files and you  want to upload all of your nine images  to this tool so our chapter one is this  I'm going to come back and see the miss  history's map so we want to go now and  upload our first chapter right here we  want to fit the screen like this and we  want to add text now you can choose  different different headlines or sub  headlines right here and we want to go  now and paste our storybook so I'm going  to put this smaller text because we have  a lot of a lot of text to upload to our  tool  so I'm going to copy all this chapter 1  text and I'm going to paste it right  here  so we want to go now and make sure to  fit the screen or you can see it is a  little bit longer so what you want to do  is you want to go now and format this  text so you can you can fit the screen  I'm not going to do that right now  because again I don't want to waste your  guys time and just make sure to enter  this text or if it's too long you want  to go and ask chat GPT to make smaller  text now it can actually fit the screen  but again I don't want to waste your  guys time and format all of these stuff  right now you can see that it is really  easy to make it fit just like this make  sure to her do this and make sure also  to make the text bigger so that is  something really important you can see  that it is easily it can fit just you  want to remove these spaces between the  text so once you're done with that you  want to go and click on ADD page right  here you want to now go and upload your  second image you want to make it fit the  screen just like this and you want to  repeat the process over and over again  now what is going to be our chapter two  you can see the chapter two you want to  tell chat GPT to write the story for  chapter two you want to come back on  canva upload your story and you can have  this ebook or playbook in just few  minutes so this is how you can go and  generate this play so this is how you  can generate storybooks over and over  again upload them back on KDP on Amazon  and and make passive income for yourself  this is really easy to do anyone can do  it the only thing that you need is time  and you need to work on lots of  different story books and upload them to  Amazon so if you really like this method  guys if you want to see more videos like  this make sure to like this video make  sure to subscribe and make sure to leave  a comment down below if
