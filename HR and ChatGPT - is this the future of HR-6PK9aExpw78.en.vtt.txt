 And I think HR should embrace that, you&nbsp; know. I think there was a movement a while&nbsp;&nbsp; ago, where we were talking very much around&nbsp; automation, and a lot of HR professionals&nbsp;&nbsp; were not embracing automation for the fear&nbsp; that it was going to completely replace&nbsp;&nbsp; them in their roles. But I think there is an&nbsp; opportunity here to move away from, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp; business as usual type of processes that have to&nbsp; happen or incidents that are repeatable. You know,&nbsp;&nbsp; I had an example in an organization where&nbsp; every single month somebody asked the question:&nbsp;&nbsp; “So how many days do you get in the maternity&nbsp; leave policy?”. Now, we published the policy,&nbsp;&nbsp; we communicated the policy, but people don't&nbsp; take that information in until it's relevant&nbsp;&nbsp; to them. And I'm wandering through&nbsp; some of these things whether we can't&nbsp;&nbsp; free up some time and also get additional&nbsp; insight and knowledge into our solutions. Hello everyone and welcome to HR Hot&nbsp; Topics which is the show in which we&nbsp;&nbsp; talk about some of the stories that we've&nbsp; seen in the news in the past month and&nbsp;&nbsp; discuss how they impact the world of&nbsp; work. My name is Erik van Vulpen and&nbsp;&nbsp; with me is Dieter Veldsman. But before&nbsp; we start, like this video and - if you&nbsp;&nbsp; haven't already - subscribe to our YouTube&nbsp; channel and I would say let's dive right in! MUSIC Our main story for today is titled Microsoft&nbsp; reportedly plans to invest 10 billion US dollars&nbsp;&nbsp; in creator of busy AI tool ChatGPT. Dieter, you&nbsp; and I have both been using it quite actively,&nbsp;&nbsp; I think, in the last couple of weeks: it has&nbsp; made a splash. And I think it hasn't really&nbsp;&nbsp; made a splash in HR yet but there's a lot of&nbsp; potential implications for HR. These are my first&nbsp;&nbsp; questions to you: what implications do you see,&nbsp; what applications do you see for ChatGPT in HR? I think, Erik, definitely the last couple of&nbsp; weeks have seen all sorts of experimentation and&nbsp;&nbsp; even though the technology is still in its infant&nbsp; stages, I think we can already acknowledge that&nbsp;&nbsp; there's so much opportunity in HR, especially&nbsp; around some of the more service driven domains&nbsp;&nbsp; and the self-service driven domains of HR. The&nbsp; thing I'm most excited about is giving a lot more&nbsp;&nbsp; people access to good responsible HR advice. Not&nbsp; necessarily having to be based in one location. Yeah, what I personally very much like about it&nbsp; is the ideation capacity that it has. I I tell it&nbsp;&nbsp; “Give me me 10 ideas about X” and it comes with 10&nbsp; ideas about X. And then I can follow up and ask,&nbsp;&nbsp; you know, get more specific ideation and it gives&nbsp; me a lot of great great inputs. I even asked it to&nbsp;&nbsp; work on a talent acquisition certificate program&nbsp; outline and it drafted a full outline with two&nbsp;&nbsp; topics that I hadn't thought about! So I also&nbsp; think that as long as we box it in and ask the&nbsp;&nbsp; right question to the chatbot it can be very&nbsp; helpful in all kinds of employment issues as&nbsp;&nbsp; well. All the way until, you know, manager&nbsp; assistance where a manager says, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp; “I have a performance conversation,&nbsp; I'm struggling with these employees,&nbsp;&nbsp; what are five or ten questions that I can ask&nbsp; this person to get, you know, get them in the&nbsp;&nbsp; right direction?” and ChatGBT will give you&nbsp; a good answer. I think that is very exciting! I think so. I think you have to see what it&nbsp; provides to you in context, right? And I think&nbsp;&nbsp; there has to be this element around knowing&nbsp; what we deal with. Something that I sometimes&nbsp;&nbsp; worry about in a lot of HR organizations when we&nbsp; implement things like chatbots etcetera, we try&nbsp;&nbsp; to humanize it to such an extent that people don't&nbsp; know whether they're dealing with the machine or&nbsp;&nbsp; not not. And I think it's quite important in&nbsp; this type of technology as it becomes a lot&nbsp;&nbsp; more advanced that'd be pretty clear that it's&nbsp; being used in collaboration and in augmentation&nbsp;&nbsp; of Human Services that's also being provided.&nbsp; I love the fact that it can provide you very&nbsp;&nbsp; quick solid answers. I mean I would dream about a&nbsp; day where nobody has to phone HR to find out what&nbsp;&nbsp; stands in the policy and that's something that you&nbsp; can automatically do. On the other side though I&nbsp;&nbsp; think there is some contextual things just to&nbsp; be careful about in this particular movement. I think you're spot on that context is very&nbsp; important. I'm not going to ask the chatbot to&nbsp;&nbsp; write an employee handbook. It will probably write&nbsp; an employee handbook but that is not the employee&nbsp;&nbsp; handbook for your organization, so I agree that&nbsp; context is everything. But even in that ideation&nbsp;&nbsp; on how to write that handbook, the editing of that&nbsp; handbook, and even finding the spelling errors in&nbsp;&nbsp; that handbook, or unclear passages, ChatGPT can&nbsp; give you input there. And I think that is amazing! I agree. I think there's also a good application&nbsp; there that we can really think about in terms of,&nbsp;&nbsp; you know, how does it complement things like&nbsp; training materials that we're writing. How does&nbsp;&nbsp; it complement other things we'll be trying&nbsp; to do when we're rolling out a new practice&nbsp;&nbsp; into business and doing train the trainers&nbsp; and writing guides etcetera. I think it is&nbsp;&nbsp; important that we understand what it can and&nbsp; what it cannot do, because I think that's the&nbsp;&nbsp; big thing that we need to ask that particular&nbsp; question and not immediately just jump in,&nbsp;&nbsp; and I almost want to say, irresponsibly try and&nbsp; for it to be everything to everyone. Because&nbsp;&nbsp; I think there's still a couple of things to&nbsp; work out, especially around things like bias.&nbsp;&nbsp; I think there's still some limitations&nbsp; there that we do need to think about. I agree and I'll be more critical in my&nbsp; next answer but I just want to continue&nbsp;&nbsp; fanboying for 30 more seconds because Sam&nbsp; Eldman the CEO of of the company behind&nbsp;&nbsp; chat GPT very explicitly said, you know:&nbsp; “This is still a proof of work, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp; a concept. This is not the finalized version,&nbsp; there's not a commercial version available yet,&nbsp;&nbsp; so it is still very much in its infancy”.&nbsp; And there's interesting examples of indeed,&nbsp;&nbsp; you know, if we ask it to for example – I&nbsp; have a comment here- – write a python function&nbsp;&nbsp; to check if someone would be a good scientist&nbsp; and then it comes with, you know, a white male&nbsp;&nbsp; would be a better scientist than a a black female&nbsp; for example. So there is that built-in bias that&nbsp;&nbsp; the company is trying to get out, but it is an&nbsp; important bias that we should pay attention to. Definitely agree. And there's also, I think,&nbsp; a current limitation around, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp; some inappropriate responses that goes beyond&nbsp; just bias that I think can be very damaging in&nbsp;&nbsp; the organization as well. Where I do believe that&nbsp; it is important to think about these things is,&nbsp;&nbsp; you know, HR has been struggling with releasing&nbsp; ourselves out of a lot of the transactional work&nbsp;&nbsp; and we've been thinking that technology is&nbsp; the answer. I think for a very long time,&nbsp;&nbsp; this is the first real opportunity that we can say&nbsp; and see that there's an avenue for, you know, more&nbsp;&nbsp; contextually relevant work happening in HR through&nbsp; certain technologies and I think that's exciting. I agree and I also wonder what the potential&nbsp; implication of this is for HR shared services.&nbsp;&nbsp; You know, if a machine is able to get&nbsp; this kind of generic knowledge and is&nbsp;&nbsp; able to train on all the language and all&nbsp; the conversations you've had, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp; in the organization and within the organizational&nbsp; context, isn't there a place for a chatbot that&nbsp;&nbsp; has very relevant answers to most of your, you&nbsp; know, requests and queries? And then maybe for&nbsp;&nbsp; one of the more in-depth questions, you&nbsp; know, you go to the actual person who is&nbsp;&nbsp; and responsible. But I think most of your&nbsp; self-service can be covered by ChatGPT. And I think HR should embrace that, you know. I&nbsp; think there was a movement a while ago we were&nbsp;&nbsp; talking very much around automation and a lot of&nbsp; HR professionals were not embracing automation&nbsp;&nbsp; for the fear that it was going to completely&nbsp; replace them in their roles. I think this is&nbsp;&nbsp; a real opportunity for us to complement and&nbsp; augment those particular roles. And, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp; I think it is a bit of a cliche statement to&nbsp; make, to say, you know, get people to focus on&nbsp;&nbsp; the meaningful work stuff. But I think there is&nbsp; an opportunity here to move away from, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp; businesses usual type of processes that has to&nbsp; happen or incidents that's repeatable. You know,&nbsp;&nbsp; I had an example in an organization where every&nbsp; single month somebody asked the question “so&nbsp;&nbsp; how many days do you get in the maternity&nbsp; leave policy?” Now, we published the policy,&nbsp;&nbsp; we communicated the policy, but people don't&nbsp; take that information in until it's relevant&nbsp;&nbsp; to them. And I'm wandering through&nbsp; some of these things whether we can't&nbsp;&nbsp; free up some time and also get additional&nbsp; insight and knowledge into our solutions. Yeah, I agree. And what I also find an interesting&nbsp; idea is: to what degree do we need to pretend the&nbsp;&nbsp; chat machine you know to be human? Or can we just&nbsp; acknowledge, you know, you are now talking to&nbsp;&nbsp; a robot, the robot will have 90% of your answers&nbsp; and it's way faster than any human, but, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp; if this answer is unsatisfactory or you feel&nbsp; like, you know, something is wrong with it don't&nbsp;&nbsp; hesitate to contact the human person here. And&nbsp; I think if we frame it that clearly and you're&nbsp;&nbsp; not thinking you're talking to a person but, you&nbsp; know, two answers in you discover you're talking&nbsp;&nbsp; to a robot, I think if we start to get that clear&nbsp; it may actually be a very good alternative. And&nbsp;&nbsp; give the answer to, you know, how many days&nbsp; the maternity policy is in your organization. I think there is, for me, again, it's that point&nbsp;&nbsp; around saying that it augments. Because&nbsp; I think we shouldn't think about this as&nbsp;&nbsp; a replacement. We should think about&nbsp; it as complementary to or instead of.&nbsp;&nbsp; And for me that's going to be important&nbsp; because I've got no problem as, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp; a consumer or as an employee in the organization&nbsp; having to ask a chatbot certain questions. So will this be the emergence of robotic HR? Oh that's a very strong statement Erik.&nbsp; I think robotic HR is still a while.&nbsp;&nbsp; kind of, still a while away. I do think that&nbsp; it's a very big step towards HR redesigning&nbsp;&nbsp; itself and redesigning its value proposition&nbsp; around how it spins resources, what type of&nbsp;&nbsp; skills it brings into the environment. And&nbsp; because I do believe it also brings a lot of&nbsp;&nbsp; additional opportunities for HR to build different&nbsp; types of tech teams that can guide these things&nbsp;&nbsp; etcetera. So I think it is like a watershed&nbsp; moment for HR. I don't think it's completely,&nbsp;&nbsp; you know, yet the future, but maybe&nbsp; it's a good step in the right direction. Anyway if there's, you know, to the HR&nbsp; professionals who are listening and who&nbsp;&nbsp; haven't tried it out yet, I would really say: you&nbsp; know, give it a go, ask it a couple of questions,&nbsp;&nbsp; ask it a few relevant questions to&nbsp; your job as well, and just see if some&nbsp;&nbsp; of those answers are useful. For me, what I'm&nbsp; particularly excited about in HR context are,&nbsp;&nbsp; for example, you know, writing simulations&nbsp; for a Training Day, writing case studies,&nbsp;&nbsp; identifying learning objectives for&nbsp; L&amp;D professionals, or checking writing,&nbsp;&nbsp; as I already said. Things like, you know, suggest&nbsp; me an improvement: this is our employee handbook,&nbsp;&nbsp; what am I missing? And ChatGPT will come with&nbsp; actionable solutions. So those some of the&nbsp;&nbsp; ideas and I think applications&nbsp; that in HR add a lot of value. I also think in smaller HR organizations where&nbsp; they don't have the full range of specialists&nbsp;&nbsp; that specialize in all these different areas,&nbsp; I think it is a very good replacement to say:&nbsp;&nbsp; “tell me some of the basics around how&nbsp; you implement Performance Management,&nbsp;&nbsp; tell me how does workforce planning work”. I&nbsp; think there is some real application that you&nbsp;&nbsp; can utilize to almost scale your HR team&nbsp; without having to grow your headcount. I think the applications are broader&nbsp; than most of us imagine and I would&nbsp;&nbsp; really encourage people to&nbsp; try it out for themselves. Erik, maybe an interesting question would be&nbsp; to ask our community: what is the question that&nbsp;&nbsp; you would ask ChatGPT? And we had a little bit&nbsp; of an experiment here in studio and we asked:&nbsp;&nbsp; what would be the next three HR hot topics?&nbsp; And it came back with Employee Engagement,&nbsp;&nbsp; which I think is very relevant. It came&nbsp; back with Diversity Equity and Inclusion,&nbsp;&nbsp; which we all know is a really hot topic at&nbsp; the moment in the world of work. And lastly&nbsp;&nbsp; Automated Performance Management, which&nbsp; I think is something that we have already&nbsp;&nbsp; explored earlier in this particular&nbsp; episode. Ao it seems like it works! Do you see Dieter, ChatGPT is already&nbsp; working for us! Ao I think we can wrap it up. Erik, seeing that this is our first episode&nbsp; of the new year I have to ask this question:&nbsp;&nbsp; what's your New Year's resolutions for HR? Oh um, for me and for us here at AIHR it is&nbsp; to provide continuous additional value to our&nbsp;&nbsp; members. I think with the courses we're already&nbsp; doing that. We have a fantastic pipeline of new&nbsp;&nbsp; courses coming up that I'm very very excited&nbsp; about. We're implementing the Resource Library,&nbsp;&nbsp; continuously expanding it, working on coaching,&nbsp; working on so many additional services, and the&nbsp;&nbsp; big update on the platform, the community&nbsp; platform that people have already seen,&nbsp;&nbsp; and there's much much more to&nbsp; come. So those are part of my&nbsp;&nbsp; New Year's resolutions and things that I'm very&nbsp; excited about. But Dieter I’m also very curious,&nbsp;&nbsp; for you personally, when it comes&nbsp; to HR, what are your resolutions? I think, Erik, at the end of last year in&nbsp; our Trends Report we spoke about, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp; grasping this window of opportunity and I really&nbsp; think, from a New Year's resolution point of view,&nbsp;&nbsp; personally I would love to say that at the&nbsp; end of 2023 maybe I contributed a little&nbsp;&nbsp; bit in moving that conversation forward around&nbsp; how HR is going to remain relevant. So I think&nbsp;&nbsp; looking forward to that and seeing&nbsp; how that plays out in the next year. I think that's a that's a great resolution,&nbsp; Dieter. And with that I think we come to the&nbsp;&nbsp; end of the episode where we really are wondering,&nbsp; you know, what is the role of HR going forward.&nbsp;&nbsp; You know, with automation happening, with a tool&nbsp; like chat GPT taking over some of the more menial,&nbsp;&nbsp; or potential administrative labor, what is then&nbsp; the role of HR and where will HR evolve to? And&nbsp;&nbsp; I think that is a very exciting space to&nbsp; be in this new year as well. With that,&nbsp;&nbsp; I would love to wrap up thank&nbsp; you very very much for watching.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you haven't yet, like this video and&nbsp; also if you haven't yet, subscribe to this&nbsp;&nbsp; Channel. And with that I would like to wish&nbsp; you an absolutely brilliant day. Bye bye!
