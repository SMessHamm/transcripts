 is the artificial intelligence spot chat  GPT coming for your job joining me today  to talk about this is alyosha birch  heart of the German Research Center for  artificial intelligence  I'm Christy bladson bringing you another  DW business special  ayosha thanks so much for being here  I'll tell you we did ask chat gbt to  write an introduction for you but  unfortunately it couldn't find enough  data on you just yet but it also did not  know who I was so we can both hope that  this special booths are profiles a  little bit I mean you're an AI expert  have you played around with this smart  chat bot yet  yeah of course I played around with it  and also looked at social media but  other people tried out and I must say  it's absolutely amazing even to me if  you had asked me five years ago if that  would be possible with AI today I would  have probably said no way  okay interesting I want to come back to  that point in a second but just some  quick context for anyone who's not  familiar Microsoft is said to be in  talks to invest 10 billion dollars in  open AI that is the creator of chat GPT  now chat GPT is an advanced language  model developed by open AI that can  generate human-like text it's been  trained on massive data sets to  understand and respond to a wide range  of topics it's been used for chat Bots  language translation text summarization  and it has the potential to change the  way we interact with machines and  process text Data let's chat about all  the cool things chat GPD can do and its  potential impacts on different  Industries  now if you couldn't tell that  introduction was written by chat GPT  itself we tested it out on the show  earlier this week as well first we asked  it to pitch an idea for a sitcom set in  80s West Berlin and it came up with the  characters in an outline of story all by  itself then we asked it to write a scene  with a few jokes they were not the best  jokes I've ever heard but I've also  heard worse  and we told chat gbd to drop a Halal  meal plan for the week those were pretty  good ideas and finally coding we asked  it to write a simple to do app in Python  and not only did it write the code but  we tested it out and it actually worked  so Al yosha back to you what I'm seeing  in this bot is script writer  nutritionist programmer all in one  there's a lot more it can do as well  we've been talking about AI coming for  the majority of human jobs for years  tell me what jobs has AI already  replaced  foreign  we have been dealing with AI in many  different contexts all the time but but  we didn't talk about or we didn't even  notice like all the kinds of navigation  systems that we are using search  translation tools and in all kinds of  small helpers that we've seen but but  they they haven't been so not noticeable  as Ai and now I'm in chat GPT of course  has the potential to to change a lot but  you always have to ask yourself I would  say the other way around what kind of  jobs do we want to hand over to the  machines if you see that for example  doctors or nurses that they spent 40 to  60 percent of their working hours for  for documentation then I mean this we  want to direct to the machine so that  they have more times with the patients  you see if we only use it for  rationalization that they then later on  I mean twice as many patients I mean  then we haven't won a lot  yeah I think that's a really great point  I was just talking with a colleague  about how we immediately talk about AI  replacing jobs but at the same time  we're dealing with a major worker  shortage for example in nursing like you  said in a lot of under other sectors  um as well well so talking about the  potential for the software what about  this Microsoft deal what do you think as  an AI expert a company like Microsoft  could aim to do with this this kind of  tech  I think at this point we are still in  the b2c setting right and they are  probably expecting that the kind of web  search will will change or be changed to  these um yeah big language models or  even the chat functionality that we  won't have the the search we've seen in  the past uh but but maybe a chatbot will  answer our question will direct us to  web pages we'll maybe ask back do you  mean it this way or that way and this  means of course also the advertising  Market on the web will change a lot and  I guess that's what they are after but  at the same time you have to see there  is also the the whole big B2B business  and we have many for example in Germany  Europe many small and medium Enterprises  that might want to use these  Technologies for doing their paperwork  or for talking to their customers or for  doing certain analyzes of their data and  so on and so forth and there I think we  have to talk about I mean we we don't  know yet um there are many much more  open questions I would say than in the  applications that you've shown that are  quite straightforward where maybe also  mistakes don't matter that much  what do you think about claims that this  technology could potentially challenge  Google  it's really a potentially potentially a  challenge for Google I would say as I  said for the search market right I mean  that it's more comfortable if you get  the answer right away or if you get an  explanation and then the same aspect did  you mean it this way or that way right  it could help us finding the right  content other than I mean like we do  today where we go through all the web  pages and browse through them ourselves  and try to find the right content that  we are looking for I mean this could  really change  and also the the recommendations we've  we see in online marketing right they  might also change they become more  natural more outspoken yeah you don't  only get the product but you may get the  short text why do we recommend this  product to you or yeah did we yeah did  we get you right that you are looking  also for something else or did we get  you wrong and then you have much more  interactivity I would say also in in  online shopping  right right so then we can really see  why Microsoft would consider investing  such a large sum of money in this  technology well we spoke with one Tech  CEO Yasha Sivan of innovation platform  I8 Ventures about this technology he had  mixed feelings let's take a listen  a I am not sleeping for the last month  literally not sleeping and I'm a great  lover of sleep and it is because what we  see now is the culmination of 10 years  of extensive work actually a global work  that open AI has been able to utilize to  bring in something that is a  demonstration of something that is a  wonderful and frightening Revolution  now alyosha in your opinion what is  wonderful and what is frightening about  this technology  I mean what is wonderful I would say  it's a kind of democratization light  yeah I mean many people now can play  around with this technology can get  experience can learn how to use it how  not to use it yeah where are limitations  and this is really good I mean yeah in  terms of making people aware of the  technology and helping them getting into  contact play with it and learn about it  um  of course there are many questions that  need to be discussed if we talk about  the the usage in in business context  what do we do with our confidential data  what do we do with all kinds of  information that's not in the system  like names of medicaments or like spare  part numbers and all kinds of  information that you're using in  business context that this model has not  yet been trained on how do we get all  this information in also how do we do  quality management how do we make sure  that what gets out is does not do harm  to people does not lead them in the  wrong direction give them wrong uh  advices and so on I mean this is one  thing but at this point to be honest my  biggest horror is that all this  artificial information texts also images  music and other kind of AI results that  they are polluting the web you see the  web we've seen so far has been curated  by humans all texts that you see are  written by humans of course also by bad  and uh and anti-democratic and so on  humans but by human right and all photos  have been taken in the real world and  sooner or later with the web can can  double or triple or get much much bigger  fed by text that no longer contain  proven facts and photographs or images  that that have been made up by machines  and then of course the next generation  of machines will probably be trained on  these texts and you understand what's  going on then  yeah that leads me to another question I  had I noticed that you actually tweeted  about chat GPD a few days ago and you  compared it to a sort of nonsensical  answer that your young daughter had  given to some questions I mean is is  this why you made that comparison are  you saying that some of the answers that  this bot is giving us are are not going  to be accurate or are going to be  nonsensical  yeah in Parts it's it's it's  hallucinating right we've we've seen  this example it made up uh uh citations  of of scientific papers that don't exist  because they just I mean they just  fitted at this place right so it made it  up but this can be changed I guess  that's not the problem but the  comparison to the to the small side is  for me more more kind of feeling that  the systems that they are sometimes you  have the impression that they are like a  small child because they are  sometimes the systems are over explicit  they are explaining things about the  world that you know already and that  um a human speaker would never mention  or mention twice or Thrice within two a  few sentences in in different ways and  this of course because these these  systems don't have empathy for the for  the listener they don't know what the  other person knows already right so they  are they are telling you some things  that are quite obvious and this is maybe  a little bit more the the comparison but  I also like my my daughter was being  asked by a uh by some person water a  baby doll in the in the small  doll trolley what's what's her name and  she said a small child cannot walk  [Laughter]  but um yeah  I mean do you feel like you answered  that already or would you add anything  to that  I would say that this pollution of the  web with uh with things that we that we  that we cannot filter out easily  afterwards I mean that's probably a big  problem and other people of course have  noticed that these systems that they  might reproduce uh biases uh prejudices  racism and other things that are in this  world and that are in in the texts and  in the dialogues that you find on the  web and so it's it's it's mirroring to  us uh deficits of of the world we are  living in  okay that's a really interesting answer  because I also asked chat GPT the same  question I asked it what's the worst  thing about you  um and its answer I want to read now it  said one one potential issue with chat  gbt is that it's been trained on a data  set of text from the internet this means  it may repeat biases or misinformation  that is learned from that data like any  language model it is a machine and may  not always understand the nuances  nuances of human communication of the  context at which a statement is made  I mean I mean that's basically what  you're saying right  yeah that's what I'm saying but this  gives me the opportunity to to mention  one thing you you have to distinguish  between the underlying um  gpt3 language model that can do a lot  more and this chat component chat GPT  component that has been put so to speak  on top of it if you wish and this chat  component is uh is a quite uh searching  for Harmony and it tries to be  unobstrusive right and if you ask it  nasty question then it will answer some  people put it this way some people put  it another way oh I'm just a chatbot I  cannot explain these things I'm not  creative and and you you see some of  these answers have been scripted yeah so  obviously because I mean in the past  we've seen that some AI systems have  given quite blunt answers to nasty  questions and so I think people were  much more cautious this time and so it  has been trained to be modest and to be  a kind of realistic about its uh its  limitations and its potential and so on  but you can see I mean I guess these are  the scripted parts so these are not the  part in air quotes that the systems  feeds by heart but the engineers I think  they have built it that way so that  gives these answers that people are not  afraid so I wouldn't take this answer  too serious to be honest so you're  saying that's sort of a marketing answer  it's not really the a an objective robot  telling us the objective truth  yeah exactly I mean and this at the same  time sorry but at the same time it makes  you feel that the robot knows more about  itself than it does right so it's it  could also be misleading so we get the  impression oh well there's a very nice  well-behaved  um yeah a politically modest and trained  person sitting next to me which is of  course not the case it's a machine  now Mr Sivan who we heard in the quote a  minute ago was talking about how this is  10 years uh were the fruits of 10 years  of innovation you said yourself that  five years ago you wouldn't have thought  we would be talking or about this or  looking at it like this I mean I feel  that we've been having serious  discussions about AI this kind of AI  potentially replacing human jobs for at  least a decade now so I wanted to ask  you  um yeah do you feel that the  conversation we're having today is  different than that conversation that  was going on five or ten years ago or  has chat GPT fundamentally changed that  conversation  it will probably become easier now to to  help people support people but after all  we we want to see that the  socio-technical systems work I mean  human machine interaction that's that's  the that's the term right we want to  want to get support by these machines  again I mean it's not the idea my idea  at least to replace people but to  support people I mean doing work that is  I mean there are the four D's of  Robotics it's the dull dear dangerous  and and I forgot about the fourth but  these are the the kinds of tasks that we  want to hand over to the machines first  and this is something that we need to  keep in mind so people often ask ask the  question like there is some from from a  different planet there's this technology  coming and then we have to ask ourselves  does it help us is it good is it bad  what do we I think that's that's the  wrong type of Framing and thinking so we  have to ask ourselves of all the work  that it's lying around and that nobody  can do or nobody wants to do or we are  not fast enough I mean we should we  should build the machines that way that  it can help us with this work and I  think we are a step further now with  this technology and with the ease of use  that we see but at the same time I told  you that there are many questions for  for business use cases about  confidentiality of data and so on and so  forth and GPT 3 and gpt2 are two or  three years old I mean in the tech  business that's long and we haven't seen  or I haven't seen any decent business  model built on these things so there  must be a reason for that  well then just to wrap up now alyosha  with this forward look that you're  talking about what next steps should the  technology World should Society take  when it comes to this technology  I think we should embrace it and we  should look at our jobs and at the task  we have to do also in public  administration in in uh yeah organizing  our social life and and web search as  you said and and discussion for and  other things where do we want to go and  and where do we want to use this  technology and then the next question  that need to be asked is of course who  owns the technology who can use it and  what uh who can change it and yeah what  what I mean at the moment we are  depending on on a few suppliers of this  technology as we have been depending on  on technology in the last 20 years on  digital technology but that's the that's  not sovereignty I mean and we've seen  that that things can change and Things  Can Happen very fast in this world and  we also have to think about this how do  we build these infrastructures and how  do we build these possibilities so that  more uh that that we get a little bit  more uh bigger uh yeah ecosystem of  players that can that can offer these  services so that that we are not  depending on a few uh companies I mean  be they private or or or or or  publicly sourced I don't know  well we'll have to leave it there I want  to say thank you very much to you  alyosha burchard he's from the German  Research Center for artificial  intelligence  I also want our viewers to let me know  in the comments what your thoughts are  about this what your job is and whether  you think chat GPT could easily replace  you or what jobs you think should be  replaced by technology like this and if  you would like more on major changes  affecting business today I'd encourage  you to check out our latest business  Beyond special here on YouTube too many  people the challenges of demographic  change thanks so much for watching I'm  Christy platson in Berlin until next  time take care
