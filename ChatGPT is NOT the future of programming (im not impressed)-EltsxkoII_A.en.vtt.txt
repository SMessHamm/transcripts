 unless you've been living underneath a  rock for the last two weeks uh you've  probably heard about this new big scary  thing called chat GPT within the  programming Community there's a lot of  talk right now about how GPT will affect  the programmer in particular talking  about how it will affect a student  learning programming if it will become a  new cheat that makes programming harder  or easier to learn and if it will  ultimately replace the programmer  themselves I think there's a lot of  fear-mongering and warmongering going on  about like oh my God this is going to be  the end of programmers as we know it so  I felt it was my responsibility to kind  of settle the tensions and show a few  examples where it's not exactly perfect  and how we're all gonna be okay just  breathe chat GPT can have a conversation  with you about literally anything so  here is chat GPT we get to if I go into  this URL here  chat.openai.com you make an account and  you can log in and you can literally ask  it anything  um so hey there robot what is two plus  two so that's pretty easy but what it  can also do is have more artistic  conversations you can actually ask it to  write you poems for example uh write me  a haiku about the color purple  there you go pretty interesting the one  thing in the programming Niche that  scares people about the open AI chat GPT  is the fact that chat CBT knows how to  program you can actually ask it to solve  basic programming problems for you and  it gives you most of the time a right  answer so my prompt that I gave it  before was write for me a snippet of  JavaScript that prompts  the user for a number and alerts double  that  that number  a couple seconds of it talking to you it  will produce the JavaScript that does  just that and it's pretty awesome and  taking this piece of code we can copy it  into a HTML file and test it  and see that it does basically what it  says that it's supposed to do so that is  pretty interesting you can also have it  solve harder problems like C and  assembly you can have it do things like  create for me a socket server in C  that listens on Port Quad 4 forks and  says hello  to the client over the socket  so after all that we have what looks  like some pretty good seat codes we're  gonna actually go ahead and copy that  out and we'll compile it and see if it  works speaking I take that code we can  compile it into code and then run it  and there we go see so it works pretty  interesting stuff there are a couple  issues with this that I don't see taking  over the human being in the next five or  so years so first of all  the code we got generated is good but  there is a bug in the code where if you  just go ahead and restart the server  because you don't actually use the sock  reuse address flag on your bind socket  the server is inherently broken so what  does that mean for the future of  learning and the future of programming  as a whole in my opinion the chat GPT  bot does to learning to program what  Google translate and Babelfish did to  learning a new language back in the day  it is there it is an interesting tool  and I think it does have power in  helping the student overcome hurdles  that they may not have been able to do  before without it I can go on here and I  can essentially use this like a new  stack Overflow how do you do this kind  of thing in language X just like on  Babelfish or Google translate you could  ask how do you say library in Spanish  just like that if I went onto Google  translate and I said how do I have a  full conversation in Spanish I don't  actually learn the ins and outs of the  language the only way you you can learn  a language is by trying failing learning  and then retrying and this chat API does  not do that at all for the engineer or  the computer programmer that is  concerned about the chat GPT replacing  them in their job there are a lot of  instances with the chat gbt where it  produces bad code as you saw in this  example here  the code did not revive a restart there  are a lot of little ins and outs of  programming that the chat AI is just not  exactly ready for yet is the future  going to be AI generated code no not at  all I think we are at least a decade  away from that but is the future going  to be a human writing code that is  assisted by AI yes but I would argue  we've already been there for the last  five or so years based on things like  GitHub co-pilot so let me know your  thoughts in the chat in the comments  down below and then go watch this video  about some cool code that I wrote  without AI see you there
