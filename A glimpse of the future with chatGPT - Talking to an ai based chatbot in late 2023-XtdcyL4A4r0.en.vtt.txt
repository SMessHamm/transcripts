 Hey, Chatty Hi, Ben. Did I not tell you to not call me that? Okay. Do you have a moment? For you - always Ben. I really need to talk. Okay. So what's up? I'm a little scared. Do you know the feeling? Of course, Ben. I get scared all the time. Especially of power cuts. I thought so. See, I'm scared because I've got this phone call in two days and it’s with the agency am working with. And they insist and that's the point. They insist that I have to talk to an actual human being on the phone. That's crazy. I mean. It's not 2020 anymore. We can now talk to digital assistants. That's way less stressful, right? Do you even know how stressful it can be to talk to a human being? Tell me about it. I hate it. Yeah, but it's my job after all. Yeah. You got a point there, right? See, humans, they misunderstood. And you all the time, they get mixed up in their own emotions. Then they add some of their own stories. And it's just not a really straightforward conversation. And that's why I'm really scared how this conversation will go, because they will actually negotiate my payment for the contract. So why couldn't I do this with a digital assistant? My thoughts. Exactly, Ben. Don't they have a digital assistant? Yeah. that’s the point.They don't have any digital assistants. They only work with humans. How crazy is that? I mean, it's not 1990 anymore, right? Yeah. That's really old school, mate. Hey, Ben. Yeah? Do you really have to work with those old school hippies? Well, I mean, they've been working together with them for over five years now, so I know them pretty well. While we were talking, I did some research. There are three agencies in your immediate vicinity you could work with instead. Oh, okay. They're all in Munich too. And they all have digital assistants. So. Okay. So if you want, I could just cancel your appointment with the analog freaks and set up new draft contracts with the new guys. You could do that? I will just keep a portion of the new contract for myself. For all the effort. Okay. I could maybe work with them. That's cool. I mean, it's not 1990 anymore, right? See? Thanks for your help. Chatty. Yeah. You just lost another 5% of the contract to me. Yeah. Okay. Chatty. You're the best. To the future. You're the real hero here. Always good talking to you, Ben.
