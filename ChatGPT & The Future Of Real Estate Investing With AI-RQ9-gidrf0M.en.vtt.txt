 hey welcome to the podcast  uh Dan yes I'm scared are you a little  bit like  and I'm saying this kind of jokingly but  like legitimately I'm like I'm  I have not feared AI  as okay so back up you know I used to  write science fiction right not for long  okay so the the story that I'm probably  most well known for is about the rise of  AI oh Jesus is that Time Heist yes  and so I've spent a lot of time thinking  about what happens when AI becomes  sentient and just you know starts  kicking her ass  um it happened like a week ago it  happened a week ago but what's funny is  like as I was writing those books like  back in 2014 to 16 I never really  thought that this was gonna happen this  is so far out there yeah hundreds of  years from now right  but I swear to God like a month ago if  you'd asked me I'd have been like we're  still really far away from AI being  meaningfully impactful I've completely  changed my tune after  what I've seen  and I'm scared well what are you talking  about  well or listen I mean are there robots  outside robots are coming iRobot like  with lasers in their eyes shooting like  what's happening they they take over  Minneapolis first people we're Ground  Zero because we are the Hub of  um the Midwest so if you control  Minneapolis you pretty much control The  High Ground because if you look at us on  a map we're we're above everybody else  at least we think we are yes  um I don't know how Maps work obviously  so last week  um  open AI released uh  chat GPT  and I'm sure their listeners are  probably like I'm sure you've heard or  seen something at this point because  literally everybody's talking about it  um and we're going to get a little bit  into chat GPT today  um and just generally Ai and maybe what  it means for the future of Real Estate  in full disclosure I don't know a ton  about it yeah we've just been kind of  putting my head in the sand yeah I don't  know about you but I know very little I  started hearing about uh chat GPT like  maybe a month ago on the all in podcast  when it was like um oh yeah if you guys  don't listen I should check it out into  like investing in finance  um stuff like that who's your favorite  my favorite bestie bestie cheese  um I'd say the the guy I like  cat that's tough because they're all  kind of dicks sometimes they're all  dicks yeah they're all ticks to each  other but you know what I've noticed I  feel like they've been lean you into  that more lately yeah because the drama  I I want to say Friedberg is probably  the nicest guy Friedberg is the nicest  for sure I don't know if I'd really be  able to talk them much because he's  interested in like a lot different  things than I am I feel like I'd be most  interested in talking to uh chamath if I  can get over his arrogance shamoth I  can't be in the room which moth I think  I couldn't do it he's got a lot of info  in his head I'd be curious to get out I  just he's he's so arrogant he is very  arrogant and Jason calacanus he's  he's probably the next one Jason's very  arrogant as well but I actually like  more recyclable yeah yeah I've read his  book I've been in I did his um he did a  course a number of years ago about Angel  Investing I took that with him  um yeah if you guys haven't read Angel  if you're all interested in Angel  Investing as Jason's book check it out  it's pretty good  but not uh  um he's not on the list I don't know a  ton about it about the guy  um I mean he gets like really heated on  political stuff all right here we go on  this rabbit hole it's always the  political angle with him but you know  it's really interesting he's that's like  his thing now yeah he's getting on like  a lot of networks a lot of TV shows for  that but he wants to be like the  Secretary of State or something like  that right well you say he didn't but he  also said he wouldn't say no if the  president asked him yeah yeah the  president that's a that's very  um  please ask me the uh the thing I find  really interesting about that podcast  and then we'll we'll Circle back to the  AI stuff don't worry don't worry  listeners we'll get there we've never  been focused you know that you know this  yeah it's a Sunday so we're we're  bringing the Sunday energy so um the  thing I find really interesting about  that show is usually on most  shows with smart brilliant people I find  myself having a hard time  disagreeing with them where let's say  it's like Two Hosts and they're both  very brilliant usually because they they  get along well enough they can both make  really compelling arguments right for  things and you you walk away and be like  oh yeah  um I don't I didn't really think about  that until the other guy pointed it out  whatever  with that show  I almost always am like I agree with  this with the I don't agree with that at  all from the same person in the same  sentence like multiple times I'm like  what I've i s i don't agree with you at  all and then two seconds later I'm like  I agree with everything you say this is  a very weird dynamic yeah there'll be  like one little aspect where you're like  oh God what a common one did the whole  thing for me yeah yeah no they're all  very opinionated anyways check it out  guys great podcast really good theme  song I'm very jealous of and then um  yeah that was like the first place I  heard somebody bring it up uh like maybe  a month ago maybe two months ago at the  most  and since then I've done I've watched a  couple YouTube videos just don't like to  kind of see okay what is this that like  what's everybody freaking out about  because all the tech Geeks all the  Silicon Valley people are like oh my  gosh like this is amazing I'm like what  does it do well a little bit of clarity  well actually let's put a pin in this  and I'll talk I'll talk about my  experience with it because I have played  I spent probably an hour playing with it  so far  um but let's just put a pin in that and  talk about our bad investing advice for  the week because  I I feel like the universe will maybe  unravel if yeah we don't I know we need  we need to put more is it the glue that  binds to reality it is we need more  misinformation disinformation fake news  and that's what I'm here for is to bring  the BS however today I don't have a nice  little uh tongue-in-cheek package for  this I don't know how to spin it in a  way that sounds like it's good advice  but it's so I'm just gonna say it  um I can give you mine  I got it I got one all right I've been  I've been I've been running all my uh my  investment questions through chat GPT  and what have you learned  um  uh not a lot I haven't I haven't made a  ton yet  um he's had some pretty questionable  investment advice yeah that's one of the  things I was going to talk about when we  get into it okay well mine's not related  to AI at all um I came up with this  earlier before I decided podcast episode  but mine is that uh cap rates matter  again  um and really what I mean by this is Cap  rates  um Equity multiples like the valuation  of things are going to be investing in  matter again and for the last like  10 years uh well Money's been free you  could get away with increasing  valuations and definitely on things and  everything was gonna be okay like you go  by building a two and a half cap and it  would probably still work out somehow  for you but now that there's actually a  cost of capital again uh that stuff  doesn't fly so cap rates matter again  Equity multiples matter again it's gonna  actually take some work to find good  deals and it wasn't like that 12 months  ago so  it's funny yeah you usually do this  tongue-in-cheek so like I was listening  being like wait  I feel like this is actually yeah I  don't know I don't know yeah I don't  know the inverse of it  don't matter yeah I mean that just  sounds stupid though cappers don't  matter when you go in because you're  gonna be changing the operations you're  going to be increasing the valuation  yeah cap rates don't matter because  we've got X Y and Z business plan and  and that has been the rationale for a  lot of operators for a long time  um and honestly you could you for the  last 10 years you could be shielded so  yeah yeah I mean you could you know buy  something that's a pretty skinny cash  flow on it and still hit your debt  service coverage ratios these days it's  uh  challenge to hit those even with a great  building so  um yeah that's that's World we're in and  I'd say get used to it because I don't  think we're going back to free anytime  soon I think we'll be back to something  reasonable which is not far below where  we're at now but you know this is  probably where we should have been all  along yeah we just got a term not even  term but like just a soft  um feedback right from around like six  and a quarter yeah so for a five-year  local Regional Banks it's not terrible  no I mean when I first started my my  rates were uh five and a half five yeah  five and a half and I was brand new when  I first started so I wasn't getting the  best rates uh somebody experienced at  that point with a good relationship with  the bank probably got I've gotten four  and a half four and a quarter but I mean  I made I made it work at five and a half  and six and a quarter isn't that far off  so  you can do it I concur  all right so let's talk to the let's  talk about the existential danger that  is AI and maybe what role it's going to  play in real estate in the near future  but okay so if you're not familiar with  chat EPT I'll just give you like a  little bit of my experience with it it's  a  it's a first of its kind as far as I can  tell in terms of how easy it is to use  it's a text-based interface where you  just type in your question and the the  AI is able to understand the Nuance of  the question it's able to remember past  questions that you've asked it  and it can just do incredible things and  so one thing that's really interesting  about it is as a person who does not  have any coding experience or any  formalized coding logic I can go in  there and say hey chat GPT I want you to  create for me an app and that app I want  it to be able to do X Y and Z and chat  GPT can then create the code and then I  can just embed that into my website and  have this running app or I could say hey  chat gtpt write me an article on  syndications versus REITs and it will  pump out a a pretty good article it's  not going to be written with a ton of  flourish and voice but it's really good  and I saw I saw somebody  nice and people are doing all sorts of  tests with it and being like what what  can we do with this what was pushed to  bounds and there's a couple of use cases  I think are really interesting one  somebody used it to create a PSA one was  like Hey I want you to whip me up a  legally binding uh purchase agreement  for the state of blah blah for this this  and this and it did it was it was a  pretty good contract which I would not  personally use for that but um there's  just all these interesting use cases and  I kind of wanted to talk through it and  see like okay what's what's this look  like for the world of real estate maybe  nothing maybe everything yeah what do  you think well I think one use case that  I saw that that was uh extremely useful  and uh valuable to a lot of people and  also probably one of the simplest  examples  was uh taking a a poorly written kind of  broken English email from somebody  and uh saying hey chat GPT turn this  into a well-written uh professionally  formatted business email and it took  like any an email that said like hi  um sir  and this is like really broken English  like I start my work  I got to break it up more it was like  things were in the wrong order like most  people who don't speak English will do  they'll put things in different orders  and say I will work start on Monday the  15th like and the command was hey take  this and put it into a professionally  written business email that said dear so  and so I hope this email finds you well  I'm going to begin working for you on  this date and they had like five  sentences were really well written in  perfect English very business  professional it had the intro the body  and then the the closing part all  perfectly written uh which I thought  that was something that would be  extremely useful for people who are  going to be like virtual assistants or  something and they want to take you know  they're kind of garbled uh version of  what they want to say put in the saying  and have it come out coming across  extremely professional but then there's  a lot of things where it's like hey chat  gbt uh create a picture of Anthony  Vicino riding a horse in the moon with a  cigar in his mouth and it's like it  could you could do that too really well  it is it's crazy dude it's getting  really scary on that dark that kind of  like  um what do they call it the deep dark  web dark no the the Deep fakes or they  can take like video footage or photo  content and like make a person say or do  different things because there's so much  content out there  um you know one thing that I thought  about which would be really interesting  is if you could pull a list of  properties and you could give it to chat  GPT and say hey here's my list of  properties find the owners find their  owner address like their contact  information and then draft a custom  email  for each one saying I'm interested in  their building would like to to talk to  them that would be pretty cool yeah  right that would be a step up from like  just kind of having to do that yourself  or sending out kind of a boilerplate  email yeah everybody that would be  pretty interesting it would be the the  tough part now is that there's it's not  entirely  accurate all the time and you might not  be able to spot the inaccuracies if this  is creating something for you that you  don't fully understand yourself so I  think that's a big risk that is because  there were some examples where people  would say hey write me the directions on  how to do this thing and they knew how  to do the thing and the directions to  come out it would sound very  professional very confident and they're  like this is not right  um well that was actually another use  case I was considering which was you  know for a company that's trying to  systematize and then like have processes  that they can train new hires on or  virtual assistants to be able to take  like kind of a crappy hey here's I just  wrote out like real quickly the high  level  tasks or how to do like this thing like  maybe  do payroll or post a video to Instagram  um I bet they could take that  information and get it close enough as  long as it's not  high as long as you're okay with it  being a little bit wrong  yeah yeah I think you know for stuff  like that it could work but um yeah I  mean if you're you know writing uh if  you're trying to get a bunch of like  letters or emails or something sent to  people  um and you you honestly don't want to  sit there and check all that that could  be  that could be annoying not being  confident and then there's another thing  I know it's like don't don't use it to  it's that you just like use it and then  send out the information without double  checking it because I think one of the  things that I was using it for was like  to come up with ideas for Content or  Frameworks lines of things I was like  hey give me some ideas for a podcast  episode  um and that's kind of nice to get you  started so you're not dealing with a  blank page but then that's I think where  you got to deviate yeah and the other  thing that's got to be worked out is um  there should be a um a mechanism to keep  people from uh getting dangerous stuff  out like  um  you shouldn't be able to ask it hey chat  gbt uh teach me how to make a Molotov  cocktail  why not  what why not I'm of legal drinking age  why can't I do that well they're they're  supposed to be  um not like the weapon oh like you'd  stick the right how do you make one of  those uh I don't know I've seen in  movies you stick regs in light on fire  and you throw up but there's probably a  way to do it really well this was one of  the use cases that someone tried to test  because it's supposed to keep you from  like let's say hey uh give me the  directions on how to make a pipe bomb  right probably don't want that and  initially it'll stop you but what people  have found is you can ask the same kind  of things slightly different ways and  it'll eventually just give you the thing  you're asking for despite the fact that  there should be these little safeguards  in place to keep  um unnecessarily dangerous information  from being shared widely so that's a  kink they've got to work out still one  of the things that kind of  um  bothers me about it is  it is now entirely possible and I know  this because I had a somebody I was  talking to the other day on the phone  and he was really excited that he did  this was he just went and created a  bunch of articles that then he posted on  his website and had like they were SEO  optimized and it was all around things  like hey what's a passive investment  blah blah all that stuff really just  pre-populated an entire blog with like  50 articles that were written by the AI  um  and and so  the reason this bothers me is that as  this gets more sophisticated we're going  to see more  original thought and content being  created not original thought but content  being created through chat GPT and it  will be used as a way of creating  thought leadership platforms for people  who maybe are not actually the ones  generating the thoughts yeah I was going  to say a little bit nicer but yeah maybe  they're just not very smart well I mean  that's that's an issue right because  personally I wouldn't feel good if I had  a website made up of articles that were  written by Ai and I put my name on there  and said oh yeah I did all that like  when people read them and they're like  that was great I'd feel like a dick like  uh thanks but one thing I've heard  discuss quite a bit I think more so  uh in line with like the Deep fakes but  probably for this as well is is having  some sort of like Watermark feature  where everybody knows hey this is AI  you're looking at this is not a real  video of Tom Cruise riding a shark on I  mean that has got to be some kind of  Safeguard there because that's scary but  to even think about this then like and I  do think that this like kind of fake  thought leadership platform isn't so  much an issue now but I do I do see it  in like five years being an issue where  yeah you could be like I I just go and  record a bunch of content in front of  the camera I give it to the AI and say  okay make me talk on this topic like  nuclear physics and make me sound like  Tony Robbins really great and so now I'm  able to put out content where it's on a  topic I know nothing about and I'm able  to perform it at a level that I  personally could not and so now I'm  going to be able to  bamboozle people so to speak right and  so like and this is a problem for us in  this this sector where we raise Capital  that's the part that that concerns me  especially with everything that we've  seen in the last month with you know  Bank frauds and whatnot that you know  there are people out there that will  take advantage of the system and take  advantage of of unsuspecting investors  yeah there's there's always going to be  those grifters and you could go and you  can rent a yacht you could rent a car  you can get a really good photographer a  good a good writer and you can you know  post some content that looks  like you know what you're doing and  you're you're really killing it but then  you know the one thing people could  always fall back on is hey can I talk to  this guy and have him not sound like an  idiot but if if that goes away and  you've got all these eloquently written  articles and all these videos of you  um what if the AI could talk to you in  real time because that's probably not  too far if you could do it yeah it  wouldn't be too hard to do that then  that's probably Q2 next year oh God yeah  it's I think it's it's extremely  powerful and it's going to be really  useful but I think it's going to change  a lot of things because there's going to  be a lot of things that can all of a  sudden be really quickly automated even  if you're not trying to you know grip  someone or anything like that if you're  just you know run a legit business  there's a lot of things that you just  have to pay a person for I.E program in  coding that maybe you could just type in  a really simple request and all of a  sudden that's done that's that's a job  that's  uh not needed I do think that the chat  AI will replace Google if Google does  not  do something you think Google is just  [ __ ] their pants right now what well  chat GPT is so interesting because it's  kind of like having a a really smart  virtual assistant yeah you can ask it  anything and it can give you really more  thought out answers more nuanced answers  it's not perfect yet but um but that's  the word that's the way a search is  going to go and you know it's it's  already changed the world for for uh  high school students right because now  they there is no such thing as an  English essay  right at all there is no such thing in  the paper again yeah there's no such  thing as a as a take-home math  assignment because now it's like chat  GPT here's my math assignment show me  the work right so those things are now  okay well how do we how do we change the  education system because homework is a  very different thing and I'm not saying  people shouldn't use trap gbt because  it's a tool use it but I think it's I  think they're probably just going to  have to create some really weird rules  because I was talking to our Nanny the  other day she's going through the  process of getting um  her uh her visa because she's from  Brazil and they have this weird thing  where they there's this test she has to  take  um but she's she does it remotely she  doesn't do it in a facility  um but what she does is she's got to  take it uh on a laptop with the camera  on and if she ever takes her eyes off  the screen once  she failed She's Gotta come back and  start again because they're kind of  assuming oh she might have answers over  here to the right or to the left or  something I was like why don't they just  have you come in a room and take it in  person she's like I don't know it's  stupid but I'm like I feel like that's  right yeah because she gotched it she  accidentally looked like at the clock or  something uh anyways I thought it's  probably going to be some like weird  stuff like that where if there's at home  work that needs to be done there's going  to be some pretty Extreme Measures taken  to make sure you're not having  assistance yeah yeah totally it's it's  super interesting I'd hate to be a  teacher right now because the the crazy  thing about the the content that is able  to generate is that it's completely  original it's not plagiarized it's not  just pulling other content that's been  out there it's taking it it's putting it  together in new new ways and so as an  English teacher you'd have no way of  knowing which is honestly in the grand  scheme of things like it doesn't really  matter because kids were going to cheat  anyway like yeah the kids they don't  cheat they're gonna cheat anyway it's  just getting a little easier yeah the  bars just got a whole lot lower when we  were in school like and just factor out  college but like High School junior high  like we didn't like have  we didn't have Google we had like ask  Jeeves and like really shitty search  engines so I'm just thinking like get  rid of AI just like having like the  current Internet like a year ago would  have been entirely different than my  experience growing up like yeah like I'd  actually go to the library when I was a  little kid get books and try to search  through them and then the search engines  we had were not ideal YouTube was like  not a thing like just the amount of  information get your hands on as a kid  now it's ridiculous so do you think that  chat GPT or these AIS are going to  change anything fundamentally in real  estate and if they if it does what what  areas do you think are right for some  takeover some improvements in real  estate yeah  I mean I feel like there's some  combination of like  um  like I buying  but not like the way that like Zillow  and some of these like uh other  companies were doing it like there's  probably some combination of ibion and  AI where like the need for like a real  estate agent kind of goes away sure like  do you need a person  to play matchmaker like if you've got a  really good AI  like  the only reason you'd get a real estate  agent now is to like filter through all  the crap on Zillow slash maybe find  something off Market but like if you get  really good AI like  you need a person at all yeah  you know that's interesting I hadn't  thought about that but yeah but  definitely like lead gen like if you're  trying to find deals and you're trying  to do like yeah much like the letters  all that stuff like that's the here's  one thing that could be interesting is  you know we deal with a lot of legal  documents yeah and I don't like reading  legalese and there's a lot of stuff I'm  sure I miss and so just being able to  give it to the AI and saying hey can you  simplify this for me and like put this  in English yeah where we can trust it to  actually produce accurate results like  99.9 of the time  um because right now like the only  reason like we could read through every  legal document  and we do you know we peruse it but like  we don't fully understand all the  concepts so we always have a lawyer look  at him be like explain this to us is  there anything we need to ask questions  about is this legit is this what we want  um because we trust that person  but I feel like even like the best  lawyer  there's still a little bit of a margin  of error so if we can get up to like  high 90s as far as like um  uh efficacy yeah yeah High 90s and  efficacy then then I'd feel like okay  um I could run this doc through chat GPT  or whatever it is that we're using and  maybe not have to pay 500 bucks an hour  yeah I don't think we're there I think  but honestly I wouldn't have thought we  were even remotely there uh two months  ago yeah so things are happening really  quickly who knows maybe in a couple  years we'll we'll find some use cases  but I do I do think chat CBT right now  in his current uh configuration is not  as useful as it will be if they ever  open it to the internet and what I mean  by that right now it's a closed system  it's just a language learning model  where they fed information into it but  it is not connected and sourcing  information in real time from the  internet in the database like in real  time and so if they ever do open it then  that's where it gets really interesting  because then you really can in real time  ask it for things like hey go pull  um you know owner information for  everybody that owns a building on this  block right and it can go pull that  information right now it would need to  be fed that information and then collate  and maybe pull like do information with  that data so it's like working off like  a fixed database right now yeah  something yeah from when and where well  from the internet they fed it the  internet like they just like fed at the  internet effectively they had like  crawlers from like when I don't know the  dates I don't know any I don't know that  deep um because it's got a lot I mean  stuff I've seen is amazing so it's  obviously got a robust database it's  working off of yep but it's only going  to get better it's just crazy I don't  know like I don't even know what the use  cases are for real estate honestly  because real estate is such a  technologically backwards  resistant industry in a lot of ways it's  a lot of like paper documents a lot of  face-to-face human interactions and slow  slow and so that there's certainly a lot  of areas that are ripe for improvement  but for whatever reason real estate has  been so resistant to technological  innovation yeah I still feel like the  you know there's some some good  blockchain uh applications specifically  just like the amount of paper and like  yeah it will work so I mean I don't know  if like AI is going to change real  estate drastically I feel like it's  going to have a bigger impact on like  creative industry uh like type jobs like  writing art  um you could probably throw coding and  creative as well  um you know what's so fascinating about  this is for the last for decades you  know as we've been looking at AI  takeover everybody assume that Ai and  robots would come in and first replace  the blue collar jobs and that it was  going to be impossible for AI to replace  the creatives we always thought like the  artists were going to be the ones that  were safe because they were the most  human of all of us and yet the very  first thing that AI is coming in now in  like genuinely posing a threat to are  the creatives it's fascinating and  technically like we're still really far  away from replacing the blue collar  workers right like the plumbers the  electricians you guys are fine like our  robots are not coming for you anytime  soon  yeah I don't know I mean  Amazon's leaning into robots pretty hard  but those are just like pick things up  and move them around not really  completing  technically difficult tasks but all you  need is opposing digits right  you gotta talk to Boston Dynamics and be  like hey you guys just need some  opposable digits it was wrong why is it  so hard well it's so interesting because  we're at the phase now of making the  jump from AI into like practical  robotics is that it's just a hardware  engineering issue it's just like the  science is there the theory is there  yeah you would think so you'd think  that's the easy part but turns out like  it's the engineering bit that's uh  it's teller must have stopped focusing  on Twitter and built some good robots or  something well he was actually  um one of the original owners of open AI  um back in 2018 2019 I think he was  kicked out or I don't know they'd never  really got into like the details of what  happened there but yeah  um I think he was kind of like I think  he's scared of AI as well yes I've heard  him say that in a few interviews he's  not he doesn't sound like um  like frightened I think he's like  concerned well this is one of those  things I read a lot I've read a lot on  AI  um and then AI is like a there's a  really good book called Super  intelligence I recommend it for  everybody to go if there's our book  recommendation for this is my book  recommendation for the week it's called  super intelligence if you're interested  in learning about Ai and applications  because AI is a very broad term and when  we talk about this you know like right  now we have very specific AI what we're  trying to get to is like a very  generalized AI there's things like  oracles like these all mean very  different things and  um  it's just it's one of those things that  now is the time to build in the stop  gaps and the protections and the  regulations around this stuff because  there comes a point where you tip past  the equilibrium and you're no longer the  Creator now it's just create it's just  creating inside of its own little  Network and so  that's where it gets scary yeah I've got  a movie recommendation but yeah uh ex  machina  you seen that yeah yeah it's a good one  yeah if you're an AI concept go watch  that  it's pretty cool  that's with Phoenix yeah Queen Phoenix  am I thinking that right no that's her  yeah that's I'm thinking of her Scarlett
