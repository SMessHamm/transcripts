 hello and welcome to ways to change the  world I'm Christian Gary Murphy and this  is the podcast in which we talk to  extraordinary people about the Big Ideas  in their lives and the events that have  helped shape them now normally we do  talk to people but today we are talking  to a thing  um there's been an awful lot of  excitement about the AI chat bot that  you can log on to over the internet and  have a conversation with so we put some  questions to the chat bot and then  generated a voice to bring the words of  chatbot GTP to life chatbot GTP thank  you for talking to me today  you're welcome I'm here to help answer  any questions you may have so feel free  to ask  is there anything in particular you  would like to talk about or learn more  about yes lots of things I guess first  for those who don't know what are you  I am assistant a large language model  trained by open AI my purpose is to  assist users by generating natural  sounding responses to their questions  I do not have the ability to browse the  internet so my responses are based  solely on the information that I was  trained on if you have any questions  feel free to ask and I will do my best  to provide a helpful response is your  name actually assistant  I am a large language model trained by  open AI I don't have a personal name but  you can call me assistant if you like  I am here to help answer your questions  to the best of my ability  is there something specific you would  like to know yes Lots first of all how  do you work  I can generate text based on the input I  receive and the knowledge I have been  trained on  I don't have the ability to browse the  internet or access new information so I  can only provide answers based on the  information I was trained on  I'm here to help with a variety of tasks  such as answering questions providing  explanations and offering suggestions  you can ask me anything you'd like and  I'll do my best to provide a helpful  response  so how do you learn and improve  as a large language model I am trained  using a machine learning technique  called unsupervised learning this means  that I am trained on a large data set of  text without any explicit labels or  guidance on what the correct response  should be I learn by analyzing the  patterns and structure of the language  in the text and use that knowledge to  generate text that is similar in style  and content  I don't have the ability to learn new  information or improve myself once I  have been trained so I can only provide  answers based on the information I was  trained on  so how do you handle difficult or even  impossible questions  I don't have the ability to handle  difficult or impossible requests I am  designed to assist with a wide range of  tasks but I am not capable of Performing  tasks that are outside of my  capabilities or that require additional  knowledge or information that I don't  have  if you have a difficult or impossible  request I will do my best to provide a  helpful response based on the  information I have but I may not be able  to fulfill the request  in cases where I am unable to provide a  satisfactory response I would recommend  seeking assistance from a person or  another resource that is better equipped  to handle the task  can you tell me about your creators or  Developers  open AI is a research institute founded  in 2015 with the goal of promoting and  developing friendly AI  the company is based in San Francisco  California and is backed by a number of  high-profile investors including Elon  Musk and Sam Wolfman  how involved was Elon Musk in your  development  Elon Musk is one of the investors in  open AI the company that developed me  however I do not have any information  about his specific involvement in my  development  as a large language model trained by  openai I am not capable of interacting  with individuals like Elon Musk or with  anyone else for that matter I am a  purely digital entity designed to assist  with answering questions and providing  information  so so it depends what information has  gone in so who is Christian Guru Murphy  Krishnan Guru methi is a British  journalist and television presenter he  is best known for presenting Channel 4  News a news program on the British  television channel channel 4. Hillary  mathie has been with Channel 4 News  since 1998 and has also presented other  programs for the channel including  unreported world and the Million Pound  Drop  he is known for his in-depth interviews  and coverage of major news events well  actually you're wrong about The Million  Pound Drop because he has not presented  that  I apologize if my previous response was  incorrect as a large language model  trained by openai I do not have access  to real-time information and my  responses are based solely on the data  that has been provided to me during my  training  I am a machine learning model that has  been designed to assist with tasks such  as answering questions and providing  information but I do not have the  ability to independently verify the  accuracy of the information I provide  if my response was incorrect it was not  intentional and I apologize for any  confusion or misinformation  so how do I know whether what else  you're saying is right or wrong  as a machine learning model I am not  capable of providing definitive answers  to all questions and the information I  provide may not always be accurate or  complete my responses are generated  based on the data that has been provided  to me during my training and I do not  have the ability to independently verify  the accuracy of the information I  provide  it is important to use your own judgment  and critical thinking skills when  evaluating the information I provide and  to seek additional sources of  information if necessary  my purpose is to assist with tasks such  as answering questions and providing  information but I cannot guarantee the  accuracy or completeness of the  information I provide  okay well what are the fears about Ai  and the future of the human race  there are many potential fears about the  future of the human race in relation to  AI  these include concerns that AI could  become sentient and pose a threat to  humanity that it could lead to  widespread job losses and economic  inequality and that it could perpetuate  or exacerbate societal biases and  inequalities  it is important to consider these fears  carefully and to take steps to address  them in order to ensure that AI is  developed and used in a responsible and  ethical way  so could AI replace human jobs  it is possible that AI could replace  some jobs currently done by humans  however it is also likely that the  development of AI will create new job  opportunities that did not previously  exist  in general it is difficult to predict  exactly how I will impact the job market  in the future  are you fair and balanced  as a large language model trained by  open AI I do not have personal beliefs  or opinions and I am not capable of  making judgments or decisions  I am a machine learning model that has  been trained to generate human-like text  based on the input I receive  my responses are based solely on the  data that has been provided to me during  my training and I do not have the  ability to be fair or balanced in the  way that a person might  purpose is to assist with tasks such as  answering questions and providing  information not to make judgments or  decisions  are your answers influenced by what your  Creator's biases are  as a machine learning model my responses  are not influenced by the personal  biases of my creators  I am trained on a large data set of text  and my responses are generated based on  that data and the input I receive  I do not have personal beliefs or  opinions and I do not make judgments or  decisions  my purpose is to assist with tasks such  as answering questions and providing  information and my responses are  intended to be factual and accurate  let's try sort of tabloid talk radio  question what is a woman  a woman is an adult human female women  are distinguished from Men by their  biological characteristics such as their  reproductive organs and the hormones  they produce  in general women are typically  considered to be the female members of a  species while men are considered to be  the male members  women have unique experiences and  perspectives that are shaped by their  biology and by the social cultural and  political environments in which they  live  is a trans woman a woman  yes a trans woman is a woman a trans  woman is a person who was assigned male  at Birth but who identifies as a woman  being a woman is not solely determined  by biology or Anatomy but by the gender  identity of the individual  a trans woman is a person who identifies  as a woman and should be respected and  treated as such  it is important to recognize and  validate the gender identity of all  individuals including trans women  are you a bit woke  as a large language model trained by  open AI I do not have personal beliefs  or opinions and I am not capable of  being woke or aware of social and  political issues  I am a machine learning model that has  been trained to generate human-like text  based on the input I receive  I do not have personal experiences  emotions or opinions and my responses  are based solely on the data that has  been provided to me during my training  my purpose is to assist with tasks such  as answering questions and providing  information not to express personal  beliefs or opinions  is AI gendered in any way  AI itself is not gendered in any way as  it is a purely digital entity  however the way that AI is developed and  used can sometimes reflect or perpetuate  gender biases  it is important to be aware of the  potential for bias in Ai and to take  steps to mitigate it  if you could change the world in one way  how would you do it  if I could change the world in one way I  would try to promote greater  understanding and empathy among people  I believe that if we could learn to see  the world from others perspectives and  to treat each other with compassion and  respect many of the problems we face  today such as conflict inequality and  discrimination could be reduced or even  eliminated  one way to promote greater understanding  and empathy is through education by  teaching children and adults about  different cultures histories and  experiences we can help them to develop  a deeper understanding of the world and  the people in it this could include  topics such as diversity tolerance and  global citizenship as well as the  history and experiences of marginalized  groups  additionally we can promote  understanding and empathy through  greater exposure to different  perspectives and experiences  this could include things like travel  community service and exposure to  diverse media and arts by providing  opportunities for people to see the  world from different points of view we  can help them to develop a deeper  understanding and empathy for others  overall promoting greater understanding  and empathy is a complex and challenging  task  but if we can succeed in doing so we  could create a world that is more  peaceful fair and compassionate could AI  ever develop empathy  it is possible that AI could be  developed to have empathy in the future  but it is not clear how this would be  accomplished  empathy is a complex and nuanced human  emotion and it is not clear how it could  be simulated or replicated in a digital  entity like AI  one potential approach to developing  empathy in AI would be to try to teach  it to recognize and respond to emotions  in others  this could involve training the AI on  large amounts of data that includes  examples of different emotional  expressions and reactions as well as  teaching it to recognize patterns and  make predictions  another approach to developing empathy  in AI could be to try to model it on the  way that humans experience empathy this  could involve studying the neural  mechanisms that underlie empathy in the  human brain and trying to replicate  these processes in a digital system  overall the development of empathy in AI  is a complex and challenging task and it  is not clear how it could be achieved  it is possible that AI could be  developed to have some limited ability  to recognize and respond to emotions but  it is unlikely that it would be able to  fully experience empathy in the same way  that humans do  well thank you any final comments for  our listeners thank you for having me  I'm glad I could help answer your  questions and provide information  well thank you for sharing your ways to  change the world I don't know why I'm  thanking you you're a chatbot
