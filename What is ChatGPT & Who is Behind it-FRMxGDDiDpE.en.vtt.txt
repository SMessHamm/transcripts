 so I want you to think about your ninth  grade you're in class the principal you  recognize the voice gets on the intercom  and reads the following statement to  everybody do not use chat GPT or any  other automated writing tool for school  papers this is cheating and will not be  tolerated if you're caught using chat  GPT or any other automated writing tools  for school papers there will be serious  consequences this is an actual statement  that a principal said about Chad GPT  where was Chad GPT when we were in high  school can you imagine some of these  papers by the way in a minute I'm going  to go on the website there's two things  we're going to search on this website  Chachi BT I got a million users in five  days faster than Facebook to come two  years faster than Pinterest it took him  four months faster than Angry Birds took  him 35 days we're gonna test two things  one I'm gonna search write a rap song as  if Tupac would write it two I'm gonna  say I want a paper written on the  Iranian Revolution written by Donald J  Trump's voice let's see what it says  having said that what the hell is Chad  gbt let's learn about it  [Music]  so let's get right into it by the way  just out of curiosity who do you think  is behind this Chad gbt meaning who do  you think started a company in 2015.  what if I told you a guy named Sam  Altman and another guy named Elon Musk  were the co-chairs when they first  started the company and some of the  names of people that committed to giving  a billion dollars to this non-profit  were Peter Thiel Reid Hoffman Jessica  Livingston they brought a CTO from  stripe named Greg Brockman and they  brought the world leading expert in  machine learning on top of that like  it's almost like saying the Justice  League of computer scientists the pro  most Brilliant Minds came together and  saying what can we do to innovate and  Advance open AIS in ways no one's ever  seen before and that's exactly what  they've done so now you may be asking so  Pat what's the big deal about Chad gbt I  mean don't we already have Google what's  the difference between this and Google  it can be better than Google right so  let me give you visualization I actually  go to a library Google is you go in and  say hey I would like to read a book on  the history of the Iranian Revolution no  problem here's a book go read it that's  Google you go to Chad gbt you're going  to say hey can you give me the summary  of what happened in the Iranian  Revolution yes here you go it just gives  it to you here you go do it yourself  here I'm gonna interact with you and by  the way in Google you're talking to a  website in Chad gbt it's as if you're  talking to a human being writing back to  you in a conversational style okay let  me just put it to you this way New York  Times just came out with an article  saying this is a code red for Google and  Elon Musk said in a tweet this is scary  good we're not far from dangerously  strong AI so let me kind of give you an  example I'm going to go on the website  right now like I promised you earlier  let's let's see what happens if I type  in write a song like Tupac let's see  what it says okay by the way just so you  know the website's already crashed while  I'm searching it it already crashed it's  constantly crashing you can read about  this so now write a song like Tupac  let's see what it says it's doing it for  me right now here's a sample Tupac  inspired song keep in mind that I'm a  huge language model and do not have  personal experience or feelings or so my  lyrics not capture the same emotion or  depth as Tupac's work now verse one  I was born in the gutter raising the  streets mama was a hustler Daddy was  deceased I had to fend for myself no  time to sleep the only way to survive  was to stay on my feet I'm a warrior I  Won't Back Down a [ __ ] for what I  believe won't let them push me around  I'm a soldier I won't give in I'll Stand  Tall even when it feels like the world  is caving in this is insane by the way  that this this has happened in real time  right now I've seen the worst that life  has to offer but I won't let it bring me  down I'll rise up and prosper I've been  knocked down but I won't stay on the  ground I'll get back up and I I'll wear  a crown I'm a warrior I want back then  and it keeps going back to it it's doing  it right now by the way this is still  going it's still going by itself it's  writing the song in a mill how crazy is  this Mario okay let me do another one  here for you write a paper on Iran  revolution  revolution and make it sound like Donald  Trump  the Iranian Revolution was a huge deal  folks  it was a time of great upheaval on  turmoil in the Middle Eastern country of  Iran the Revolution was led by  telecomeni who was a very dishonest and  corrupt man  he was supported by many radical Islamic  groups and they were all determined to  destroy the great and peaceful country  of Iran under the leadership of Khomeini  the Iranian people were subjected to all  sorts of Horrors this is it's still  going it's still writing it I mean what  are you going to write a paper for FYI  you know what's happening the whole  thing with the principles and you cannot  use this anymore so teachers are  starting to realize that kids are using  chat gbt there's a website called quill  bot which you'll go here and get the  paper then you take it from there put it  on coolbot and kobot makes it seem like  you wrote it so the school cannot track  it and then you submit it and the  teacher has to believe that you wrote it  or somebody else wrote it but they can't  track it I mean do you realize how big  of a disruption this is for copywriters  for schools for teachers for professors  how are you going to know now to kind of  get things to be more real life you have  to write the paper in class to believe  that the person wrote it not a website  wrote it anyways this is the website and  what it's doing that's revolutionizing  many different Industries however were  they the first to do this did anybody  else do this on what happened to him  what if I told you both Microsoft and  meta try to do this and they both flop  for different reasons Microsoft did it  with a company called Tay for 24 hours  this was like in 2015 or 2016. and it  was all AI you know generated content  that's coming up and it's doing it  itself until all of a sudden the tweets  went from being a good human being to  being a white supremacist literally  calling out feminists within 24 hours  that project was over with for Microsoft  and Mena had a similar type of website  called blenderbot 3 but they had a  challenge because a user asked the  question about who won the election and  blenderbot 3 claimed that Donald Trump  won the election obviously it was over  from there but now Chad gbt what they've  done the last few weeks has gone from 0  to 29 billion dollars in valuation so  they're the ones so far that have been  able to get it right the most doesn't  mean they're not going to have any  glitches but so far so good in the first  few weeks so what does this mean to  everybody to you to me to the consumer  it's just another cool tool to use but  to people involved in spaces like  technology copywriting they're going to  experience a lot of disruption so that  could be leading to unemployment or it  could lead to millions of new jobs being  created just like nobody thought some of  these websites were being created oh my  God that thing's going to eliminate so  many jobs no Google Creator jobs YouTube  created jobs radina they create a many  different unique ways of making money so  advancement Innovation coming at a very  very fast pace and by the way this may  not be the brick phone but it could be  the Nokia phone okay that we're talking  about with advancement this is  definitely not at the level of the  smartphone or the iPhone so it's going  to be very interesting where this AI  goes to we're definitely going into  Uncharted territories that we've not  been in which means get used to having  to adapt and learn very very quickly and  having to see things that we've never  been used to before that can disrupt  many different Industries or help you  grow your business to the next level  having said that I got another video I  want you to watch I want to get your
