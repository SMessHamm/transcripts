 foreign  [Music]  for Thursday February 9th I'm Zoe Thomas  for The Wall Street Journal  a day after Microsoft introduced the  world to its new artificial  intelligence-powered search engine  Google described its new AI enabled  search features here's what prabhaka  raghavan a Google senior vice president  said at the event in Paris throughout  ongoing investments in AI we can Now  understand information in its many forms  from language  to images and videos even the real world  with this deeper understanding we are  moving beyond the traditional notion of  search to help you make sense of  information in new ways but investors  didn't seem to be swayed by it shares of  Google's parent company alphabet closed  down 7.4 on Wednesday so what did Google  demonstrate and how is this leader in  Search and AI development coping with  the competition  our European Tech reporter Sam schechner  joins us from Paris Hi Sam thanks for  coming back on the show thanks for  having me so Google held this event in  Paris on Wednesday can you tell us what  they were showing off what did they  announce well it was an event that  Google's big Paris headquarters and they  announced a series of more incremental  additions to Google search and maps and  translate that they base on AI as well  as giving a little bit more detail about  some announcements they made earlier  this week about chat GPT style chat bot  called Bard and a new kind of Google  search result that will use generative  AI the technology behind chat GPT  to give you answers to complex questions  and I think it's that latter part that  people were most looking for and and  that certainly I was most interested in  hearing about  so you were there at the event what was  it like I mean was it revolutionary did  it show you anything you didn't expect  they showed some pretty cool little  features some of which they teased  before about how you can walk down the  street while holding Google Maps up and  it'll identify what the places of  business are in front of you if they  weren't already labeled in real life  through augmented reality and they  talked about how they think generative  AI can help answer questions that have  no one right answer which is a problem  that search results face they want to  put the one right answer at the top of  the results page but in general I think  people in the room who are asking  questions maybe were a little  unsatisfied with the level of detail  about how this would compare to chat GPT  how this would compare to what Microsoft  announced with its integration with chat  GPT and Google didn't actually say when  their new chat bot or the new generative  search results would roll out so we  didn't get an answer on timing but what  about on look for people who've used  chat GPT before will this new Google  feature look similar well there's two  different products and that was  something they clarified today there's  Bard which is pretty much chat GPT  although they would argue it's better  it's it has access to information from  Google search for instance and then  there is a Google search product  something that would be in your search  results page for certain queries giving  you generative responses and so they did  give a little bit more detail about how  that would work you know it in certain  queries like if you ask a question that  doesn't necessarily have a right answer  like the example they gave was what are  some good constellations to look at it  will then draw from a diverse Ray of  sources to generate an answer for you  that's a little different from what chat  GPT does or even from what Microsoft  announced where you know you were able  to type in a kind of complex query and  it would compare different things from  Bing and give you an answer Google says  they're working on other kinds of of  search Technologies and products based  on this underlying technology but the  one today they talked about was this no  one right answer result page we've known  that Google has been working on AI for  some time can you tell us a little bit  about their broader efforts in this  field  well Google was mostly building AI more  quietly into its services like it was  improving its automated translations or  improving its understanding of your  search query so that it would give you  better results now obviously the public  interest has changed and the company is  talking a lot more about some of these  new products that it's rolling out and  the question many people are raising  some investors and even people inside  the company is well why didn't they put  out these products sooner yeah I mean  you've been speaking with experts what  do they say about this idea that Google  has maybe been caught on the back foot  when it comes to Bringing out an AI  product  I mean I think that there's a very real  impression that for the first time in a  long time there's a potential big  Challenger to Google search certainly  Microsoft thinks so Google's response to  that is well we are taking a very the  word they like to use is responsible  approach to releasing these tools  because the reality is that these kinds  of systems like chat GPT can as the word  is hallucinate if they don't have  information for an answer they will make  one up that might be fine if you're  asking it to write a haiku about Winnie  the Pooh but you know if you're trying  to like find out what medicines you can  take to cure an earache you don't want  it to give you the wrong answer and in  fact even Google's own Search bot Bard  in the announcement they made about it  Monday they had an image of Bard  answering a question the question was  what are some facts I can tell my  nine-year-old about the James Webb Space  Telescope and people really lies that  one of the bullet points it gave was  wrong it said that the James Webb Space  Telescope took the very first picture of  an exoplanet that is a planet outside  our solar system but there are images  that have been generated from telescopes  other telescopes long before the James  Webb Telescope was even launched Google  search executive in response when I  asked him that told me that this is  precisely the reason that these things  require rigorous testing and that's why  they won't give a time frame for when  these they're coming out apart from soon  because they're doing a lot of internal  testing and now with Bard some external  testing to make sure that they meet a  standard that Google thinks is  sufficient for their products we're  talking about we're talking about  Microsoft are there other company  trying to get into  search space you know you can't forget  about China's Baidu which operates the  big search engine there and they have  announced an AI powered chat bot that's  called erniebot that they say that they  plan to launch next month so it's  definitely a competitive space and I  guess what does all of this mean for the  future of the web and how we use it well  that's a great question and I think  Google would say that they're  responsible others might say slow  approach reflects concerns about that  because not only is there a question  about accuracy but there's also a  question about what are people using  search engines to do search engines  funnel a ton of traffic to other  websites news websites some of the  sources that are used to train these  large language models and Google today  at their event actually went out of  their way to say one of their concerns  is making sure that traffic still leaves  their website that you don't just read  the generated text on a search engine  and never click anywhere alright that's  our reporter Sam schechner Sam thanks so  much for joining us
