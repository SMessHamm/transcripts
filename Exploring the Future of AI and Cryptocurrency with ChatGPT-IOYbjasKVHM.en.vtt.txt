 foreign  [Music]  [Music]  begin with the exciting topic this week  and I am genuinely excited this week I  want us to do a brief intro I've been  friends with these two Blockheads for  the questions  we all have the banking industry but  within the tech side specifically  um  for this particular week's topic um as  you can imagine on the news and  everywhere that's going Automation and  AR system is being the hottest thing at  the moment but also at the same time  there's quite a bit of a talk around you  know what's happening around the kind of  bull market particularly in the crypto  World we've now started to kind of ramp  back up and people are starting to get  more excited about over these things for  me one thing that I that I've always  been passionate about is how do these  two worlds really matter because both of  them living in a random constant moment  right and we're going to look at  particularly around exploring the future  of AI and the political currency with if  I look specifically around AF what's the  smallest team right now  so for me if I was kind of a focus on it  how do we how do we look at what is so  many use cases once you get your  thoughts on some ways we even look to  integrate cryptocurrency let's just  saying and also like the user automation  tools like AI tools  um  sorry uh  what do you call that conferences  and there were lots of lots of companies  which are doing terrible trading using  yeah  you can you can call it anything that  basically statistical analysis of fast  data and you can try different products  using that uh the thing that worries me  the most is what happens when you have a  central  company  they release  for instance a trading Bond right I can  build a trademark which asks that  system to come up with this uh  prediction for today  now what happens when anything is there  is one and what happens if our interests  are completely so and the obvious next  step if this area is designed to do  exactly what is what it asks to do so  for instance make the most for us  then does the AI then get improved  inside does it go and manipulate people  who are actually asking questions  is again  um  you know  is  foreign  [Music]  [Music]  I was thinking  I mean I'm not challenging that I'm just  thinking is it possible I mean for that  to happen  like the judge believe we have to have  that data right so if  if that data is not available  so  one guy went online and asked charging  people to test all the banking websites  right now you will get a list of  websites  and then you ask it if you build and  Hardware or just a simple program to  exploit those organizations right now  it's overly simplified scenario this is  this most practical non-build group  because even if there is an exploit that  it's not easy to actually just exploit  something unless it's something that is  yeah but with AI learning so much and  people you don't need to have some level  of shared quarters some data with future  to be able to respond in improvements  not not all this information but some  information  little bit fast  uh so I won't ask if you wanted to be  very smart given  last year  um  and this is just again we need to  understand that the AI is a system which  is develops and if there is a possible  May  exploitation even with Technologies data  distribute  so  um  we know we assumed that this system will  be sturdy and we have the security  but I think that's that's  it's not a beautiful thing but we are  overestimating our capabilities  because let's talk about here is it  something like ai's creating new  problems necessary to these are existing  problems so the scale can be quite  impactful because it's all about like  self-taught machine learning type AI  that can hardly do a lot better than  humans so so for example all this Theory  people have been out there doing that  now because it's interesting so really I  think it's a greater opportunity to have  more companies  actually go up on cyber security and  making sure that we've got like a really  sound controls in place but I think for  me when you go back to this one topic  because  you know if you look at if you look at  the world  this is the part where it is  particularly around whether you want to  cryptography or more regulated or  decentralized I think that's going to be  another topic absolutely explored but  for me there's so much value for  benefits  their classic zero trust because we  fully believe in the kind of  computerized  um systems that are outdated to kind of  like validate contracts something else  however I think for me what's very very  interesting is the scaling and roll out  of even automation before you get into  AI means there's potentially risks that  are out there around like your trading  businesses particularly if there are new  companies that are looking to launch new  remote eggs and things like that all it  can take is just have to be seriously  going and creating a huge amount of a  huge interesting kind of spike games any  sort of pricing or like value because  it's not real humans  it could be one of those things so  particularly from a decentralized  company because if we don't have those  regulations in place do you see a risk  or am I talking about  and see so there's a couple of things  with  trading specifically and then you crypto  in general not just straight so we're  gonna save training and even uh you know  basically for trading for anything not  just video right and with the trading  part there's something so I started  seeing lots of uh special videos on  YouTube of people making uh they  collectively making money with a  charging box so I'm not saying that  so  so what happens if you know everyone  starts with intensity for uh  for a tradable right so trading like  essentially uh  if I do a trade and I win so this  essentially someone that's losing yeah  right so  at some point if all of us start using  charity  [Music]  so in that case  who has the best  uh algorithm but in this case this is  different like what happens so charging  is so good right well that's what  everyone say but what happens is  everyone uses chatability  So  currently the assumption is that um  they have uh  they follow some mechanism some other  them to decide  right and that is based on uh the  capital uh  and how much variance happens so some  people from the SMA and a few of those  metrics now the main differentiate  between people is which uh pattern works  and  my view always has been that none of  this work because the moment one pattern  starts working people say that as a as a  service I I have known people who try to  serve me as well  so what happens is something works then  everyone starts communicated  so that market is  it kind of normalizes everything so it  will work configuration but the first  day it will just stopped working because  everything is  AI  it it makes that a bit it takes  because now you can mask the AI which is  in the channel not just that use this  algorithm instead of it is  who uses uses instead of it in the best  way or who gets more weird you can find  a better better ways to use it as well  interesting thing  um okay so I personally agree that to be  a good developer  yes  foreign  what are some implications  yeah so I mean one obvious use case I  mean this is a I think it's a benefit  right  um so in this  I mean it could be for uh crypto in  general but also for 450 sorry specific  but also in general as an engineer I  mean we can use chat DPS or  as a recording assistant right so as a  software engineer I think we should  we should learn how to use it to uh so  that you know it's  basically makes our makes audio much  easier so we will be way more productive  the same in the same way that we  can you know not Google but when yeah  you know before it was like very hard to  find a solution yeah  um essentially you didn't have that much  that of us  and then it was obviously you have to  learn how to use uh  you know when searching for a solution  yeah that so that you are alone  no it's basically the same I think the  same thing  I think it should we should learn how to  use it so that we are more productive  and I particularly started  um I can struggled in the first days  um I couldn't log in  let's try to see um I mean uh you know  start using it and when I started I was  like I can see the potential yeah  um and which brings me to the other  topic I wanted to mention so  um if  so in particularly right  so this is something interesting so at  the moment what what what's one of the  main issues  there's so many [ __ ] colors right so  many uh scams so many  products that uh you know when you're  about to buy a new coin a new token your  this there's a lot of uncertainty yeah  uh yes or maybe it's not a scam but just  [Music]  security issues  and I mean if if you are just  uh a regular person you you don't know  how to recall  it would be very hard for you like how  can you trust it right how do you know  if it's if it's written if written like  you know with a good code quality  um yeah so there's no way for you to  know that that will accept trusting what  people say right or you know you know  but uh yeah  right or usually the case uh essentially  what everyone does is you know we use a  third party for a security code and then  that's what makes you trust level but  going back to the point now what GPD  will allow is to people  use television to say okay here's a  piece of code  are there can you find it a security  related  on one hand that would be a bad thing  because your hypers can use that yeah  but on the other hand people can use  that to say okay this code from this new  project doesn't have any security issues  so you know that's another  um so it looks fine it was good probably  I  have  [Music]  have been fully written it means that  you know there will be less issues like  when you know essentially there will be  less people scans  or maybe less uh of issues with uh you  know when you were talking and then  there was a security issue and then  essentially it was hacked so if that  happens that opens up a possibility  where there are essentially people start  buying better choosing better projects  and that would bring more trust into the  industry and essentially that would mean  more people like crypto  so that's one uh  is a secure  token or or a well written token  is a better code that's not necessary I  mean  just from this new Republic yeah so and  just because something is secure that's  not coming yeah so  um  whatever the difference  I mean yeah  so this is one problem  this is one of the issues yeah this has  a potential I'm not saying  yeah  actually now and this is where it is  I guess  that is  um the there's quite some really  interesting open-mind field of whole  Wrath of AI developers  and things are available  to differentiate between one and two  trucks  versus the ones that could be taken  advantage because it is  this is  I don't know  okay  decentralizes generally generally works  the reason why I'm saying that is if you  think about that if there is  um  [Music]  uh world and  people  now  [Music]  yeah yeah  company  and I use open AI challenge  correctly if you notice the public post  contact maybe you cannot you cannot ask  certain questions  about  making bombs or crediting someone don't  respond  foreign  [Music]  now  one of my employees who the smart advice  did he says  he can now point that AI to a website  that is his friend runs and he doesn't  like him so what he says  this guy is almost time and then  um explain it to them right so so oh  this is true yes so so we like who takes  the ownership often making sure that  these apis because because  [Music]  but that comes from a position of  knowing how to develop so when you know  about Canada then you can use it to uh  hello but when you don't know how to get  that so if you are  if they use the AI they will never learn  to do 40. so what they do is they always  depend on  um AI so for example when it is  you should know  right  when  we are up at the same age when we were  these languages we're already there yeah  I uh this is  they memorized a sign of course tables  there's a certain balance I think it's  gonna have huge implications  and I actually what to kind of look at  it so many times  okay  let's say let's say  if stackable router goes offline most of  the development is called across the  world  and they don't know what to do next and  this is happening now because  I'm doing only if I cannot access Google  right right  because you know that it's going to be  running again yeah  sorry  [Music]  it's really interesting but you guys  haven't talked about AI specific  information  it's very much still the this is just a  case  things like that help you create some  incredibly good executable type of music  but remember the true power of AI is  that it goes into  um  this will change but at least at the  moment  don't think there is any creativity I  mean that might be argument but because  what what is he doing is basically using  the data that is there so there's  nothing  so if you ask chatavity to assist you  with something it's not that it's  creating something new again and that's  that's what that's the age that we have  right so I mean it's it's using whatever  solution or whatever all it gives you  maybe it's based on the data that's  already there I don't think as far as I  know it's not  because  if you okay so the primary questions  in a different way  credit is nothing but  using a solution for model is into  another place  that's true  the problem that this will create is  what will people do when they don't have  anything else to do like what happens  so what's what happens is  um okay so let's say I am an engineer  and I have uh some AI assistant right  um for some reason I'm lucky and I will  say okay I'll hear you you have this  instance  problems  now I could have hired two more  engineers  but now  I am selfish and I don't want to find  people and I want to keep myself so for  the next 15-20 years I'm just going to  have chat with me learn more and more  and more right  there are two potentials  and in fact the the distance  [Applause]  to the episode but um  however I think the interesting thing  about this question is we've always had  throughout history  however I think the one thing that I do  I do feel it's an interesting challenge  to me up is it's not so much that we  haven't had as before like these  revolutions you know the case of this in  particularly of multiple modes of AI is  being generated  the pace of this is really relaxed  because this isn't something that's like  three years ago  yeah  at least one million users  now if you imagine us it took ages for  TV to reach one million yeah and the  other problem with AI is it learns  exponentially now it is up to the open  AI company well the problem because  because uh the the good things when they  accelerate we won't feel the feel the uh  impact so much but when the bad things  accelerate we will feel the impact  pretty quickly right so so that's a  problem in that sense but yeah it can  learn and it will learn exponentially it  will get better at it like within three  or four years we will be 100 reliable  there's no way we will not be uh using  it yeah yeah exactly the question is how  do we manage it how do we control most  probably the solution is going to be  some kind of data isolation  almost all companies will provide you  specific set data set to work with not I  mean it actually almost has to work hand  in hand like anything to do with the  jdprs or anything else it actually looks  at the data and obviously it's actually  that almost has to work hand in hand  with these things yeah so yeah  I just thought of about another thing  that uh could happen  which is we saw like that you know  there's thousands of uh cryptocurrencies  out there and now with chargeipity  being accessible to everyone  that could mean that also many people  that were not able because lack of  technical knowledge oh yeah okay now you  know you can use chargeivity and just  say you know write me some code right  now so that potentially could be an  explosion of new yeah  um which I think is good  um the more that we're all obviously  there will be lots of [ __ ] points also  but uh they I mean they could be also  new interesting project as well but the  interesting project in the sense we are  expecting people to come up with the  interest and solution and charity or AI  helping them with that solution rather  than AI coming up with us  and that's what we expect  that's actually quite an interesting  challenge well interesting position  about that because you could have  someone who's come on I mean I can  easily say that you guys are some of the  smartest developers I know but you can  have someone as Junior as me done a  basically University for example come in  and actually using chat apt or some sort  of an AI sorry I stopped thinking about  it and uh  foreign  you can have someone who's got Concepts  and ideas like I have but I'm not  obviously smart enough to do the problem  solving myself but I've I've kind of  allowed chat to beauty or one of these  types of the tools to go out there  search  50 or 80 different projects types like  this and combines that things go right  can you take this concept this one's  like they've done it well and come up  with something for me that can help to  solve X1 Z problems yeah and that's  quite an interesting thing to have  because actually then takes away well  want to add the patient scale problem  because there'll be lots of people like  me doing that yeah but secondly there's  AB this becomes potentially like a  cowboy everyone's out there just doing  all sorts of stuff and there's also  there yeah and there's also  um I mean another  thing that could happen is that  more people could  get into this kind of uh I mean for  instance right you're uh your your you  are into the tech space but you're not a  developer now you could say okay I mean  I could try it right why not and then  you might actually start uh doing  development right because now you feel  confident that you can you can use  strategy too to do this right it seems  like  I had a similar thought but more around  Trust  of data trusting the data that we get  from chat GPT or any AI okay so one of  the problems that we face as a society  is  fake news or or information that is not  100 right correct now let's say let's  say we all use Ai and we all asked and  this is the question that I asked uh  uh what happens if I ask like if I  relentlessly ask the same question again  and again will this create a bias in  your response and it says because I'm  using because uh because my responses  are based on previous experiences there  is a possibility that it can be so think  of DDOS  and I write a script and call this API  50 000 times every day  and after 15 days no matter who asked  this question you say no no no no one  else is the best developer is the best  and this is sounds funny but let's let's  say  you are a bigger entity not a person  let's say you are a bigger entity with a  lot of money now you can have another  solution AI or humans  and you can ask  questions to change the perception so  chat gpt's  kind of has a Persona if you think about  it Chan GPT has a person of our own  Collective knowledge like the the  knowledge that the society has or it's a  person of the internet right so what if  internet was the first foreign  now I am a government who doesn't like  uh this personality so what I want to do  is change or tweak this personality into  more uh something that will work for me  yes so I employ  500 people they all write scripts every  day and they ask very specific type of  question update very specific websites  that just be talking about government's  already done on social media yeah  it's exponential yeah  so we need to have and this is the  problem whoever owns this has a moral  responsibility and a impossible job it's  it's I cannot blame them for why they  are not doing a good job because it's  very difficult to do and unfortunately  they have to do the difficult job yes  are we saying we need a decentralized  to be honest I think you're advocating  for the opposite way no no I'm looking  advocating for decentralized chat Equity  so for instance  if because if it's a wild west uh  everyone putting all sorts of stuff in  there what has there is no  self-governing technology  is essentially  uh essentially one big company yeah that  owns you know the data and  they have the power yes we  I'm saying we if someone goes maybe we  someone builds you know a decentralized  version of child gbt and same comes with  cryptocurrency right where for instance  um you you know the people can  contribute with data with their own okay  yeah that's a good point yeah yeah so  that can also be had that can also be  manipulated in that sense  the easiest but essentially what happens  is you you  the power back to people instead of  someone an entity having all the power  but remember the people as much as I  believe in people in society and the  utopian world that we're potentially  living in the reality of that and  particularly from that sort of like kind  of a true Anarchy I mean look obviously  people will stand different places in  terms of like we are good enough in the  society to like not want to blow each  other up but there are often the little  allies over there the outliers with  enough power and backing behind them I.E  the DDOS type thing that you were  mentioning before touch which is someone  that with little intentions create  enough things even in a decentralized  world to manipulate and move things  because they've got the power and scale  within there but yeah AI to do that yeah  the the the the only benefits out of  like a group of it's called trusted  companies like Microsoft or whoever's  behind us because we trust them right  now with any of the other stuff at least  the benefits behind that is that they're  almost obligated to have a set of  controls in place for this  in a way with our data with stuff that  they do because if they're not this  would be like this is a fascinating  topic and I'm afraid we'll not be able  to cover the whole show okay again I  I cannot stop talking about these things  okay yeah yeah so do things  um  make the API calls expensive right now  what happens if open AI works with uh  they already work with Microsoft so if  there is a single entity which is making  money out of it they are making money  out of it by volume yeah not by value so  what that means is they will give uh I  heard it's 42 dollars per month that  might be a rumor because 42 is a funny  number but  um but but they might say that okay you  give me 42 dollars use as much as you  want and the reason why they're doing  that is because for them they only worry  about the compute space and because they  know the whole world wants to use it  they can set the price as low as they  want  now if we decentralize it the advantage  is the the value is not defined by them  but by automatic it's it depends on how  many people wants to use it and how how  much resources available if someone  wants to manipulate the system  they have to spend a lot more money to  manipulate the system and and that's a  that's a better end you can we can have  that as a letter or even if Microsoft  does it  there should be some way of first um one  of the good things about Microsoft is  they don't sell their face API to U.S  government right or federal agencies in  U.S however they don't say the same  thing about other governments which is  funny but but they should not they  should not sell these apis to uh  entities which have potential to  manipulate other people right so for now  until we see another Wikileaks  um so that's the that's the technical  side of it how we should how we can try  to control it I don't know if that's a  solution but I'm saying make it  expensive to manipulate right it's  actually quite an interesting thing  because to be honest like you've seen  who's saying I mean forget about it  before we even talk about Ai and things  like I was saying in the last like 20  years the Advent of some of these big  giants that come through like Facebook  like everything else and they've all  gotten into some sort of practice with  the governments around like the kind of  information the Gathering and what  they're doing with it and how it's used  to manipulate like when there is a  Cambridge analytics Saga and everything  else so so there is definitely and with  some of these governments to tighten up  the controls and tighten up the kind of  governance and regulations around us as  well right but I think there's also what  that does is only the big guns like your  Microsoft like your Google is everyone  else can have the money to kind of like  really invest in these types of things  but if there's a happy middle and I  think this is where we can possibly wrap  up today's topic but like if there's a  happy middleware decentralized  from a AI perspective a decentralized  from a crypto if there's a way to  demonstrate how  the two systems with the Technologies in  place and with the kind of thinking  that's been put in place around users  like smart contracts everything else  actually helps to create more trust in  this instance so you can put governance  in other areas but at least you you know  that you're not relying on companies  with purely the intent of making money  or learning the data because we've we've  now let this be for the people but we've  put enough little controls and things in  place so that that could come up so my  final question is to wrap up and  summarize this whole thing is and this  is probably a hard one we may not even  be able to cover it today but what yeah  [Laughter]  some what controls this to Cooperative  world but what are some things that we  can put in place that helps helps the  the people who actually want to look  after the people hopefully the  governments to to get get more  confidence that  decentralized could be a good way on  both these spots  there are actually other open source AI  Solutions available yeah so no one is  stopping anyone from creating a  decentralized uh version of chat GPT it  will be little different it may not be  as mature as to activity  but the thing is  the way Society Works everyone needs to  make money yeah and the moment there is  an opportunity why will the guy who's  building I mean open AI is not it's not  owned by Microsoft it's a separate  company and in the end  they went to the guy who has the most  money of course so so what's you mean  who's there  okay okay  money is Microsoft came to the game I  know I know  the power Just shifted from open AI to  Market what I'm saying is  and we don't like the whole idea of  decentralized being good for people does  not work because  people who build these Solutions also  need to make money and when they spend  two or three years basically concept of  the startup that goes into it being  absorbed yes the only option is where  you have uh  keep it open source make it available  and it is always open source and  everything is built on open source and  decentralized that's the only way okay  but why would anyone spend time okay  let's say you create this company which  is going to build a version of chat GPT  from a different there are open open  source models that are available so or  charge GPS is just one instance right  you can create similar instances now  let's say you create a company  which does both which takes Ai and which  creates a smart contract and marries  them together such that everyone that  wants to use it has to use a new token  that you have created right so that  means someone has to buy your token  doing that increasing the value of your  token and  or provide resource to run the compute  that is required to run the ER right so  these are the only two factors that will  come into I'm assuming that will come  into this and the need to have stored  the data that that we need to run the AI  on okay  why are you doing this why are we  building this you are doing this so that  you can make money  if you're an individual who's doing it  why did beta lake is between created I  mean  there's probably some  economic side of it but I believe from a  guy like him I think it was more like  the idea sure  enough of that sort of he always needed  the capital right and that yeah but  hypothetically you let's say you started  working but especially someone like  already has a lot of money right him  right or anyone that has a lot of money  if you already have a little money uh  you might want to just do something  that's good uh for society yes okay okay  so now let's say you are doing this  right after six months Google comes and  talks to you saying that Microsoft  already got chargity I want to buy your  company I'm giving you one billion  dollars  did you sell it or not  I mean  if if so in my case right if I have  already a lot of money and if I  um if I build this  for just for the idea uh I would  probably not sell it yeah but but that's  a very specific use case 25 people who  can do that like essentially there are  people that would sell it people would  not sell it what I'm trying to say is  that not everyone will do it just for  the money  just point is around this one is that if  you look at the forget about uh all  these kinds of new tech around this but  if you would just look at the  traditional mistake uh establish we were  all driven by capitalism yeah yeah I  mean if you have startup the chances are  you actually want to sell this to make  money and everything else as much as you  want to help people if you want to make  money right the thing with and I think I  know what you're not getting at is if  the premise of this only remains on open  source then it works meaning you can't  capitalize and make it into private  company and sell it off and everything  else it's still only remains on open  source then it has the power for it to  still be for the people and not being  manipulated by companies and and  organizations for anything else so so if  it becomes like a hybrid model then I  think it can be really interesting the  scenario risk that someone creates a  company yeah they're not not even create  a company just create a smart contract  and the tokens and release it and  close down the whole thing doesn't as it  does not have any monetary investment  within that system that's the only  scenario where where it can be again  yeah we then we won't expect them to  update the system if it goes down like  we need some kind of support as well  right yeah yeah and and yeah it's a bit  complicated  subject like it's not it's not something  that we can just uh sit and come up with  a solution to be honest I think I think  we've now opened up a few topics as we  touched on a few things but we've opened  up quite a few topics a little better  keep us busy on this but I wanted to  kind of take a pause there and actually  thank my guests here today we're going  to be our regular hosts as well  um and Andy and I'm Diggy so we have the  blockheads and we're excited to continue  to  um bring you guys some hopefully some  uplifting but also some point to  consider and things to ponder over the  coming weeks particularly around this  interesting topic around cryptocurrency  as well as any of the kind of upcoming  Tech that's coming through thank you all  thank you thank you
