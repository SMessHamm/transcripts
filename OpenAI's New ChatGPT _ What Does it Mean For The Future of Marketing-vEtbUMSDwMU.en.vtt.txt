 open AI what does this mean for  marketing [ __ ] have you have you looked  at Twitter I mean it's all over social  media right now yeah I think since  Wednesday There's been uh over 1 million  downloads of it it's a game changer so  let's explain what exactly this new  technology is so open AI you know is an  organization  consumed of uh comprised of a lot of  different really smart people I think  Elon might be involved in it this guy's  Sam Altman and essentially what they've  done is they've built a framework to  allow artificial intelligence to start  to be used in Practical kind of manners  right so and it just so happens  marketing happens to be one of the  things that it's highlighting big time  right out of the gate so if you think  about it from a marketer standpoint SEO  right we've tested this thing writing  SEO Pages it's amazing one of the things  that happens with with entrepreneurs and  business people is sometimes you know  you get they call it writer's cramp or  or you know it's hard to get started  with things and what this allows you to  do as a marketer is you can just go type  in some basic prompts right some basic  keywords keywords inputs what you wanted  to do in plain English and then it it  picks this up and it's able to let's  talk about SC write SEO Pages blog posts  uh social media headlines uh email uh  newsletters uh it can even be used to  plan your content plan your content you  can write scripts for videos like that's  insane yeah what you thought was super  authentic like what you say in a video  it can give you a script you put in a  couple keywords and what you want the  tone of the video to be and it does it  for you just think yeah think about this  as a as a small business yeah and you  have these ideas but you just don't have  time or you're not a copywriter to flush  all this stuff out and to really uh  round out the content to where it's  going to be valuable if you can just put  your thoughts down in a few statements  this thing will write it for you so yeah  it's like it's pretty much like it's  shortcutting tasks that usually but take  hours to generate like writing a Blog  yeah yeah form if this is your first  YouTube video You're creating that  normally takes hours to be like okay how  am I going to do this especially if  you're doing it alone so it's really  short it's a good jumping off point it's  a great point when you have a thought go  plug it in and now you have content  basically so yeah it's gonna even the  play and feel big time and the crazy  thing is that this is only the beginning  looking at the tools it has to offer  right now and we just named off a few  guys I'm sure there's a whole lot more  that you can use but this is only the  beginning so as far as where exactly  this is going to take the marketing  industry it's kind of unknown yeah so  but there's listen if you go to G GPT  chat or chat GPT go search it on Twitter  it's a free download right now it's in I  guess it's in early availability you can  use it you can start playing around with  this and go start testing it out like we  wrote an offer letter I put a couple of  blurbs in and it wrote the offer letter  to some new developers that were hiring  we have a master Services agreement with  a client that we're working through  right now I put the details in and it  wrote The Master Services agreement for  me so you know this is yeah it's it's  amazing so yeah if you you want to jump  on this and and get familiar with it  because there is a little bit of an art  and science to doing this right and  getting the proper output yes um but  yeah this this chat GPT tool you can go  find it online it's available and you  can test it out but if the game is  changing and we'd love to know your  thoughts and if you have tried this out  what you've seen and what you've learned  because we've tried it a couple times  and what we've learned how to be very  particular about the input yes that's  the only way because again it's an it's  an artificial intelligencing it's not  100 accurate or correct you really do  have to read through it but yeah comment  your thoughts we'd love to chat with you  about this  somebody referred to it is it's the best  [ __ ] artist that you'll you'll ever  meet you know so it you can give it  enough information where I can sit at a  table and have a conversation you think  the guys I know it all  yeah but Shannon you even mentioned too  about how it can bring emotion into it  yeah with the Christmas letter yes so  guys I'll pull up a screenshot  um and I'll I'll put the the lady's name  I don't have it right now so she input  like write a letter from Santa to my  six-year-old son explaining that Santa's  not real and it captured the heartfelt  emotion and it was able to capture how  you would speak to a six-year-old  because the tone is a lot different than  how you would speak to an adult and it's  insane y'all like it's that was the main  difference between Ai and a human is the  emotional aspect but now it can capture  that so it's like gosh Dahl you know  people are for sure voicing their  concerns about this they're saying is  this going to be taking people's jobs  well it very well could if it advances  even more because like we said this is  just the beginning just the beginning so  yeah so I think it's important that you  know because even how fast it's  developing because we looked at this oh  you know just even six months ago and it  was a totally different I mean you could  pick your voice and all that kind of  stuff and we thought well this is really  great if you want to rewrite something  you already have but right now it's  it's developing really good Creative  Concepts on its own like it's amazing  how little the inputs can be and what  actually it puts out so you know if you  have looked at it before it go back and  look at it again because it's going to  be something you probably need to follow  just because it's going to be a game  changer for anything with marketing and  whatever you're doing that's what I'm  saying because I understand people being  kind of like weirded out by you because  they don't want their jobs to be taken  by technology but regardless of the fact  this is something that I feel like  especially people in this industry  should be well aware of what this can do  for you and if you're a small business  owner how you can take advantage of  these tools there's no doubt yeah yeah  listen it puts it evens the playing  field out if you don't have you know  copywriters and a CMO on staff this is  uh and it really just gives you time  same [ __ ] saves you time and it's pretty  fun man to be involved in this so so to  be at the beginning of this and they  said gtp3 which I think GTP chat or chat  GPT is like version 3.5 they said  version four GP GT gpt3 was very  powerful they said the number four is  going to be 500 times more powerful so  if you can think it this it's going to  be able to do it yeah it'll streamline a  lot of small businesses  yeah a little bit of a teaser too we're  uh we're talking about how we're going  to implement this into our marketing box  platform yeah so it's going to be it's  going to be pretty badass yeah yeah  y'all comment where you think this AI is  going to take the marketing industry  yeah
