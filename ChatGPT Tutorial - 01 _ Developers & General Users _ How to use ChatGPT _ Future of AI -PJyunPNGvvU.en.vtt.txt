 [Music]  foreign  [Music]  this is Ravi welcome to my YouTube  channel  in this tutorial you are going to learn  all about what chart GPT is  and how it works  most importantly how you can use it to  boost your productivity as a software  developer and also as a general user  I can tell you that chart GPT is a game  changer  you don't want to miss out this just  watch this video and judge yourself  I'm excited to bring you this tutorial  on chart GPT  so what exactly is chart GPT and how  does it works  is an AI tool created by open AI  it was released in 2022 November  and gained 1 million users in just five  days so when you compare with Netflix or  Twitter right so they took almost two  and a half two three and a half years to  gain 1 million users whereas charge EPT  got in just five days so you understand  what is the demand in the market for  open chat okay so GPT is an advanced  language model that can understand and  generate text  you can use the information  and create content for your website or  to write articles or to write emails are  to generate cover letters and so on  so you can also use it to generate the  code in number of different programming  languages like python JavaScript HTML  CSS and much more  you can use it to write unit tests as  well and also you can translate the code  from one language to another language  you can use it to explain the code for  example if there is a piece of code that  you are not able to understand  so you can simply ask to charge GPT and  it will explain you very nicely like a  lecturer  so chart GPT can also help you learn and  remember things faster  for example you can give one piece of  text  and you can ask chargpt a bunch of  questions to understand the text  it can also prepare you for job  interviews  you can have it to improve your resume  or write a cover letter for you  and charge GPT is going to take your  jobs do you think the chart GPT is going  to take your jobs I personally don't  think that it can replace human however  it helps human to improve quality  increase the productivity and the  efficiency  so in this tutorial I'm gonna  show you how to use  the chart gbt to get more creative and  to get things done a lot faster  so I'll be showing you various examples  for different programming languages  both for beginners and experienced  developers it's really very important in  your day-to-day life  but before we dive into that let's take  a moment and understand how chart GPT  works  chargpt uses an artificial intelligence  called a language model  a language model is a type of software  that is designed to understand and  generate human language does this Buy  looking at large amount of Text data and  learning the patterns and rules of the  language  so now without delay let's jump onto the  system and let me show you  all with the examples right whatever I  told you let's let me show you with  examples how can we use this chart GPT  in your real life  okay so now let's jump onto the system  and see different examples  how we can use chart GPT in real time  first let me cover some general stuff  for the general users how we can use  chart GPT in the real life for a general  users so as part of this General stuff  let's see first let's say if I want to  know what are the top three books for  learning.net technology so let's type  what are the top  three books  for learning  dotnet  what are the top three books for  learning.net  so now as soon as you hit enter it gives  you all the top three books in the  market for learning the dotnet  gave us the list of  documents or list of top three  books that are available to learn.net  okay so let's enhance the query again so  what are we going to do what I'm going  to ask what are the  key  takeaways takeaways  from which book let's say this book what  are the key takeaways from  from this book correct let's keep it in  double quotes  okay  so now see how beautifully it gives you  the summary of your book okay  so it is actually typing entire summary  of the book  and overall what the book provides you  okay the overall book provides a solid  foundation of C so it is summarizing  everything okay how beautiful it is okay  so now let's say how do I  become  a  QA  tester  or let's say we will do become a front  end  developer  okay so it says what are all the things  that you need to become a developer it  says see learn HTML CSS JavaScript these  are the building blocks for front end  right it gives you entire information  okay see it generated all the things  that you need to do learn HTML CS  JavaScript build projects formalize  yourself development tools right and it  says stay up to the latest technology so  it is giving so these are all the  general information that we can get  so now let's jump into a technical stuff  okay so let me make this tutorial a bit  more interesting okay so let's  understand how can we write  shell script with the help of  charge GPT I'm gonna generate some shell  script with the help of chart GPT and  simply I'm gonna copy the shell script  and use the shell script in my system to  perform one of the activity that I  require  so let's jump onto the system  so writing shell script okay  so now let me just ask  to write a bash command  to find the name of all  to find the name of  name of all  JPEG files in  a directory  and  I want to write  them all I want to write all those file  names  to write them all to  text file  okay  so see now what it will do what magic it  will do okay  write a bash command to find the name of  all JPEG files in a directory and write  them all to text file  so now I'm gonna copy this bash command  whatever it gives you okay  and then I'm going to implement it  in real time  see it gave you the bash command and it  is actually explaining  about that bash command how you have to  implement this bash Command right  let me copy this okay let me go to my  um one of the folder okay let's go to  here let's go here and let's create a  text file  let me create a text file  name this as  file list names okay dot sh  and edit this  I just copied that and I'm pasting here  okay let's paste it here now I want to  replace  this directory  I want to replace this directory with  this path  copy this  and paste it here  okay and then I want to name this file  okay I want to also put the same path  where the file the text file needs to  store okay all the names which should be  right written in this particular JPEG  file  right  and whatever the P sorry let's change it  to PDF we'll do one thing I'll change it  to PDF PDF  I want to find out all the PDFs and okay  let's save this  okay let me  forward slash  save this close it  okay let's do one thing  file list  okay actually let me open this I have to  take the text file actually copy let's  do one thing okay  delete this let's take my text file  okay  text document  foreign  let's save as save as  list  PDF  files one  dot sh  okay so if you see this is my file right  so let me just delete all others  to make to avoid the confusion okay so  now if I run this  it should generate one  list of all the PDF files that are  available  see here here okay open this see in my  directory all the list of PDF files that  are available it listed everything  correct so that's the beauty so I need  not to code anything okay I just copy it  and then change the path that's it okay  that's the beauty of chart GPT okay  okay now let me teach you how can you  write a contract with the help of  charge GPT so what we're gonna do let's  say I'm hiring couple of uh website  designers for my company now I need to  write a contract right so how can we  feed the information to charge GP T and  how can you get the beautiful contract  written by chargpt  let's say I hired uh probably a couple  of uh graphic designers to my particular  company and then I want to write a  contract  so let's ask how can okay I wanna  hire a graphic  designer  I wanna hire a graphic designer to build  my website  we have  agreed  that  we have agreed that  we have agreed that  they  will deliver  they will deliver  the first draft in two weeks okay  two weeks and offer  three iterations  free of cost  three iterations free of charge okay  any iteration  after will  charge after will be charged dollar  hundred  per hour let's assume 100 per hour so  now let's ask right  to write  a contract  write a contract for us so now it's  gonna write the contract for me  based on the above conditions  see how beautifully it created a  contract see agreement for graphic  design Services these agreement is  entered what is the scope of work and  then uh deliverables what are all the  deliverables and then what is the  payment method intellectual property  warranties confidentiality right what is  the termination rules dispute resolution  governing law entire agreement right in  witness wearoff right so basically it  gives entire skeleton it takes at least  30 minutes for me to prepare this  contract but it gave us in one or two  minutes the entire contract has been  written right how beautiful it is right  so now I want to use chargpt  for my career growth that means I would  like to write a resume I mean I want  chart GPT to write a resume for me  so let's see how can we write resume  with the help of charge gbd so now  write a resume for me  so writing a resume for me okay so let's  assume  let's say I have  12 years  of experience  in  quality  assurance  quality assurance  testing  and automation  testing  using selenium  using selenium  comma  Tosca and catalon  tools  okay  write a resume for  me  let's see how it's going to write a  resume  buy considering the inputs that I have  provided  she started writing resume  see how beautiful it is see it is  considering all the inputs that I gave  summary experience qualitation is tester  with 12 years of experience right  selenium task right and then uh and also  it is giving me company name location  and what is your roles and  responsibilities all the roles if you  see these are all related to my testing  only right for quality assurance testing  and if you see here education and skills  software testing automation testing  selenium Tasker Catalan test planning  execution defect trafficking resolution  regression testing these are all related  to  my quality assurance lead and then  certifications also it took almost like  qualitations related certifications so  how easy it is see it takes at least for  me one hour to prepare this resume but  it's just two minutes it gave you entire  regime for you  okay  okay so let me make the session bit more  interesting okay now let's understand  how can we generate python code with the  help of charge GPT  let's say write  python  foreign  for generating  a random  password  okay write a python function for  generating a random password  and see how it's going to give  see how beautifully it wrote all the  functions right  gave me the function where it generates  the random password let's assume I did  not understand some okay let's say this  what it will do I don't know here  this one let's copy this  I want to know okay what does  what does  far in range length do in this code  see it's going to explain you everything  about that particular syntax  see it gave you all the syntax right  what it will do  we can also write unit tests with the  help of chart GPT so now let's see  how can we do this in our real time  I want to write a unit test cases unit  test cases for this function right that  piece of code so let me tell  right  yes  right  unit  tests  for this function  write unit test for this function so now  it's c is going to write all the unit  tests that are related to generating the  password  random password  okay so now you see it wrote almost one  two three four five almost five to six  unit tests to cover that function  testing basically whether that function  is properly working or not you can  execute these five to six unit tests  right and it is also explaining about  what are all the unit tests it wrote  how beautiful it is  with the help of charge GPT you can also  improve the code that you have written  so basically you can improve in the form  of syntaxes  comments and also the efficiency of the  code okay so let's see how can we  improve the code  so now improving the code you can  improve the code also whatever the code  you write so let's take an example okay  this is one example where I write I  wrote a Java outer loop okay copy this  so I want to improve the code okay let's  say  so I want to write  How can I  improve  this how can I improve this code and  then shift enter paste the code  and then hit enter  so now it's gonna  beautifully improves your code and it's  gonna give you the perfect function for  the above code  see it improved the code and it provided  comments and then in the text order text  it's giving you some improved code here  okay so that's the beauty  so as I told you earlier  GPT supports multiple programming  languages  and you can also convert one programming  language to another programming language  okay so let me show you  one example  I want to convert the above Java code to  a python code  right how can we do that  convert  this Java code  to  python code  so now you see that above Java code will  be totally converted to python  see it took python if you see the window  so this is your python  okay now let us make this session  very very very interesting okay so now  I'm gonna show you how can I generate  HTML and CSS code with the help of  charge GPT and I'm gonna show you how  easy it is to build web pages  live web pages I am going to create by  using chart GPT in my system  let me use HTML okay I'm gonna write ask  write the HTML  for displaying a card okay  write the HTML for displaying code I'm  gonna copy this as it is and then I'm  gonna show you how it looks like okay in  the web  okay so if you see this is the HTML  that created it actually it has a card  content your you have one image also  right let's copy this let's copy this  and go to desktop let me do one thing  okay  let me just create a text file  text file let's say chart GPT  HTML  okay and open this  open this and paste it here now let's I  want to save this as HTML okay save it  save it as  dot HTML okay  and close this  so if you see here this is my HTML okay  let's open this so before that I want to  make some change here okay right click  edit notepad I want to basically replace  this image with the image in my system  okay so this is my system shift I'm  going to copy the path of this  and then just replace this  and save it  close it  see now  open this HTML  see card title this is the card title  and the HTML whatever the uh image that  we uploaded right we specify that is  showing here so let's close this let's  enhance little bit more okay let's do  one thing I want to add a button for  this okay add a button  foreign  below  the card  content add a button  below the curtain card content  okay let's enter what it will do it  enhances the code HTML code for adding a  button  see it already added a button called  learn more okay let's copy this let's  copy this and go to your desktop  edit this  paste it  and let's  take this image again  copy as path  replace this  and save it  okay  open this now so now it will have a  learn more button  see button is added  so let's close this now let's make it a  little more interesting okay  I want to  when I hover when I hover my mouse  okay over the card  over the card  I want  the card to slightly  slide  up  so that car whenever I hover on the card  I want the car to be slightly up  so now you see it is going to improve  the code  foreign  let's see now how it works okay  let's close this edit this  edit in Notepad  replace this now replace this image okay  again  shift right click  copy as path  image  save this now let's open and see the  magic okay  thank you  see here see it is going up when I am  hovering on the card it is going up see  perfect  so that's the beauty of chart GPD okay  so let me come back to some generic  topic I want to  apply for a job and I want to write a  cover letter  so how can we do that by using chart GPD  so let's say I am applying  for a quality  assurance  lead role at let's say some company  okay some company  write  a cover letter for me cover  letter  for me  see now it starts starts writing cover  letter  see  it created entire cover letter see your  name address ZIP code and then who is  the hiring manager it is writing to  hiring manager right I'm I'm writing to  apply qualitations lead glow lead role  at so and so company with trailers of  experience right it everything my track  record of Designing execution  comprehensive test plans test cases  everything is related to your  testing skills right  so it's really time saving  by using charge GPT  we can also make chart GPT to act as an  interviewer so that it can it can ask  a lot of interview questions for you to  improve yourself in the  specific area  so  now let's take it to the next level  interview question let's say  I want to ask chargp2 to act as a  technical  interviewer  act as a technical interviewer  and asked me  five questions  related to  five questions about  Java Script  so now it's gonna ask me five questions  related to JavaScript  see it gave me all five questions  what is the closure in JavaScript  everything is related to JavaScript  let's say I want to know the answer okay  what is the  it remembers everything whatever you the  chat history chart history okay what is  the answer  to  the  first question what is the answer to the  first question  so it's going to give you what is  closure see a closure in JavaScript is a  function that has access to variables so  it's going to give you all the  information related to your first  question  in the form of answer  we can also use chart GPT  in writing an email  for you  if you want to write an email to your  bars asking for the salary rise yes is  here let's see how can we do that  let's say now I want to write an email  okay I want to write an email to my boss  okay asking for the salary hike okay  write an email  to my boss  asking for rice  I have  worked  at this  company  see if you provide as much information  as possible it's going to give you very  good  email  foreign  and successfully  delivered  projects on time  projects on time  okay so now let's see how beautiful it's  going to write the email  see here  dear boss okay dear boss name I hope  this mail finds you the good spirit I am  writing this for salary increase after  six years of dedicated service at your  company right I have valued my member of  team and consistently delivering the  projects during my time so it gave me  everything  so it's pretty simple copy and then just  put your name  and that's it  okay so now let's get into little  technical again  so how can we write SQL queries with the  help of  charge GPT let me show you examples  so the SQL query okay let's  see how it responds for the SQL SQL  queries okay write a SQL query  to generate  a table called  customer with four columns let's simply  say four columns that's it I'm not going  to specify the column names okay  so it's going to generate the SQL query  for you okay  see here  when it's creating a table create table  customer it is assuming that the  customer table might have customer ID  first name last name email it's generic  so let's say if I want to have a  specific columns right so then I will  say write  a SQL query  to generate  a  table  a skill query to generate a table  called customer width  these  columns I'm going to specify the column  names here okay with these columns  shift enter  what are the columns customer name  I'm going to specify just string see you  need not to specify the actual float Etc  all these things I mean it's just it's  going to understand you are plain  English okay again location  string  SSN  int  right and then state  again it's string  enter  see here now it considered all the  column names that I told  right and it is telling okay customer  name is string column location is a  string column assassin is a integer  column it is explaining entire table  also  so hope you all enjoyed this video  um so I'm gonna publish  some more uh real-time Concepts  basically how you can use this uh chart  GPT in future I'm gonna post more  challenging tasks basically I'm we are  going to explore more challenging tasks  and we are going to get lot of work from  the chart GPT how can you implement or  apply these real-time  um work by using chart GPT  thank you
