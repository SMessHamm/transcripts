 How many users does chat GPT have and how much are you willing to pay for the service because very soon they're gonna be monetized that's the answer the first question same element the CEO of Chachi BT tweeted this chat GPT lunch on Wednesday today across 1 million users not charging but he was released on November 30 and this tweet was posted on December 5 so that means in less than a week at reach 1 million users already so there's so much evidence that it is just getting more and more users within the week 's going on for example we have the chat GPD say crashing all the time and sometimes it gives you some funny messages like this one I gave me were such as GPT is a capacity right now and then it puts his like random text saying write a poem about the status of Chad GPT but it does have a link that you can click on and then you just put in your email that notifies you when it does come back up and running another reason why it is significantly getting so much you there's not just because of how awesome it is what it is because There is so many articles and reports from major news sources including all the YouTube videos that were seen everywhere online just pushing this from huge Youtubers so it's definitely pointing towards the direction of way past 2, million users per week that there's one particular YouTube video about Chad GPT that I found very informative and would convince people even further to use this site all the time it was by Liam Evans had a super charge your chat G P T prompt so in this video he talks about how you can effectively type in specific prompts as in to get it to act like an expert to make a list of unique ideas to write in a specific way get it to deliver in a certain tone of voice and to various I'll put it on my God it definitely does improve the output coming back from G P T for sure it's January 15 the day of this recording and I definitely estimating there is way more than a couple million per week of users joining Chachi beach He will get a specific number soon from the CEO now let's talk about the monetization cause this is definitely coming for sure we've already seen the tweets going back-and-forth between Elon musk and Sam Altman and user chief disruptor chief disruptor says will it be free forever and Sam replies we'll have to monetize it somehow at some point to compute cars are I watering Elon Musk dead ass or what's the average cost per chat and then Sam replies back with averages about single digits cents per chat trying to figure out more precisely and also how we can optimize it you should've use chat GPT the type of that sentence then I discovered this Forbes article about Microsoft so apparently Microsoft also has an exclusive licensing deal with open AI and is planning to incorporate the technology into its Bing search engine according to report from the information now that's huge because that would mean that the Google search engine will now have direct competitor and it makes Bing Have more of an edge than the Google search I'm sure google has her own version of an open AI in the works and that begs the question with how much will they monetizes for will be $50 a month ago to be $120 a month if they charge 1 000 for they charge 10, 000 a year would you pay for this let me know down on the couch with that goes like the video consider hidden Lake Pine subscribe to the channel seen the next One
