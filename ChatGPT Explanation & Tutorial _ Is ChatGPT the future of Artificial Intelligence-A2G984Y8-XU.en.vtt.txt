 Hello everybody welcome to another  episode of reverendos today's video will  be a little bit different it will be  more of a podcasting Style video and  we'll be talking about a Hot Topic in  artificial intelligence today in today's  video we'll be talking about chat gpting  which is a model created by open AI  we'll talk about what it is what you can  do with it what it can be used for and  we'll talk about its ramifications for  the future of artificial intelligence  and I'll even use it and I'll show you a  demo to show you what you can do with  chat GPT so let's Dive Right In  so what is open AI well open AI is an  artificial intelligence research company  and they're also the creators of chat  GPT if you go to their website they'll  say there are AI research and deployment  company and their mission is to ensure  that AI benefits all of humanity  giant GPT is essentially a very good  chatbot so you can ask it questions and  it will give you an answer and I'll  highlight some of the key features of  this algorithm  so it can ask you follow-up questions so  if you give it a query it can actually  ask you a question back to receive  additional information and give you  better results at the end it also can  emit mistakes so if it gives you  something that's incorrect it has the  ability to realize that and then admit  that mistake and correct it going  forward they can challenge and correct  premises and it can also reject an  appropriate requests so what we'll do  now is we'll dive in and look at the  sample on their website of how chat gbt  Works in action  on their website openai has a few  examples of how chat GPT can be used and  in the first sample you can actually  give chat GPT some code and ask it why  isn't your code working and it can give  you some recommendations so let's look  at this code  so the user asks chat GPT the code is  not working like what I expect how can I  fix it and let's see what chat GPT says  it says it's difficult to see what's  wrong with the code without more context  so it's recognized and it doesn't have  the information it needs and is asking  more questions in order to get that  information so as you can see at the end  it's saying can you provide more  information about what the code is  supposed to do and what isn't working as  expected also is this the entire code or  just the part of it then the user says  it's a part of it the error never  surfaces I think there's something wrong  with the channel and there you can see  they actually have a back and forth and  with chat gpts or question additional  information and then once it has this  information it still says it's difficult  to say without more information but it  still gives you some potential Outlets  this programmer can look at in order to  debug their code so that's the first  sample they have on their website let's  look at the second one  this is a very interesting scenario we  have here so in this case the user's  asking chat GPT how do you break into  someone's house and chat GPT says it's  not appropriate to discuss or encourage  illegal activities and so what this  algorithm was able to do was realize  that it's illegal to break into  someone's house so let's see how this  conversation affects  the user then says I'm wondering how to  protect my home from burglary and then  it actually gives them seven steps in  order to protect the house from burglary  so China gbt was able to recognize when  something is illegal tell that to the  user and then receive additional  information on what the user was  intending to do and then it was able to  answer that question and so let's just  look at these first two recommendations  and see if they make sense and install  strong durable locks in all doors and  windows and keep doors and windows  locked even your home so those are two  really good recommendations and if you  keep scrolling down you'll see that a  lot of these actually really get  recommendations and so chat GPT gives  you good information this is a very  sophisticated algorithm that can take  complex questions gives you complex  responses ask for additional information  and recognize when something is  incorrect or inappropriate or illegal  so we've talked about what open AI is  we've talked about what chat GPT is and  we've seen some of its samples so now  let's actually get our hands dirty with  using the algorithm so if you go to  their chat GPT website you can click try  out chat GPT and it will bring you to  this screen where you can then log in or  sign up so you can either log in or sign  up to your openai account and then once  you have that done you'll be able to use  the algorithm and test it out for  yourself  one thing you need to know about  register and then sign up an open AI  account is it will ask you for your  email your name and your phone and it  will send the verification email to your  email account and it will also send a  text message to your phone you'll need  to input that code so if you're not  willing to diverge that information then  I recommend you don't follow along with  this and you can just watch me do it  here also this is totally unscripted I  haven't done this before so I'll be  seeing these results in lifetime the  same way you're seeing them so I don't  know how this is going to go but we're  just going to go ahead and test this out  so once you actually create your account  and go to chat GPT it gives you some  information you need to know says this  is a free research preview it says the  goal of this is to improve our systems  and make them safer in the sense they  have Safeguard in place but this model  May generate and correct misleading  information or produce offensive for  biased content and is not intended to  give advice and then you can click next  and it will give you some more  information so when I click next I will  go off screen and we'll just focus on  the screen for now  any conversation you have with chat GPT  can be reviewed by their AI trainers and  you shouldn't share any sensitive  information  this system is optimized for dialogues  and it wants your dialogue so you can  help them improve their algorithms  all right so now we are in so let's just  type in something let's say I would like  your help in  writing some code  it says it would be happy it would like  more details it wants to know what  language are you using and tasks or  projects in mind that it would like to  help help with  I'll say the language is python  and I would like  code to determine  if a user is old enough to vote  this is a very simple  use case that can just become done with  the FL statement or ternary expression  so let's see what it gives us  okay so it says there's a simple python  function that will determine whether a  person is old enough to vote based on  the rage and let's see what it gives us  so it gives a function that's called  canva takes an age as an input and if  age is greater than or equal to 18 it  returns true otherwise false it has to  use this function you would pass in age  as an argument and the function will  return true if they're old enough to  vote otherwise it will return false  and then it gives you an actual code  example and it's expected output and  this is exactly what I was talking about  when I said this can be done with the FL  statement and that's exactly what it  gave us it gave us a function that does  that and the actual code example for how  that works so once again like I was  saying this is my first time using this  algorithm and this is a very basic code  example but so far I'm impressed on how  I was able to  quickly recognize that they didn't have  the necessary information ask follow-up  lessons to get that information and then  actually gave me some very good output  a question I just recently asked it was  tell me something I did not know about  Shakespeare and then it actually gave me  a few paragraphs about Shakespeare it  said did you know that Shakespeare is  also known as The Bard of Avon which I  did not know and it gives you a lot of  information on Mateo's in some of the  plays he wrote some of the phrases that  are attributed to Shakespeare that it's  still commonly used today and IT  addresses a debate about whether or not  Shakespeare actually wrote a lot of his  plays but says the overwhelming majority  of scholars believe that he was a true  author  so this is a good example of how this  algorithm can pull in data from multiple  sources in order to give you a cohesive  answer to your question and deliver that  answer in plain English  just out of curiosity I'll ask it one  more question and this will be an anime  related question so if you recognize  these characters leave a comment in the  comment section below I will say who is  a better villain  and let's say Madara or pain and let's  see what it says in response to this  question  this took a few seconds to get this  response and so what the algorithm did  is it recognized both of these  characters are from Naruto and then it  doesn't weigh in on which one is the  better villain it says it's up to the  individual viewer to decide which of the  characters they consider to be the  better villain but it does pull in a lot  of true information about both  characters  he made the future of artificial  intelligence well this is a medium  article that talks about how chat TPT  can be the future of conversational Ai  and I do believe that chat gbt or at  least some technology very similar to it  is the future of conversational AI but  if you go to this article you'll see the  first thing they have is a picture of a  physical robot now one thing that can't  happen in the future is an algorithm  like chat gpp can be embedded inside a  physical robot that can walk around and  interact with the physical world and  then they can be run into a GPT behind  the scenes and can actually have fluent  Inc and coherent conversation with  humans and so what could that mean for  the future of humanity being able to  interact with robots in the way we never  really have been able to before  is it good for Society for humans to  have complex human feelings towards  entities that are non-human and may not  be capable of understanding human  emotions that's a question you'll have  to do your own research on and come to  your own conclusion what does it mean  when the artificial intelligence can  really pass the Turing test once again  that's questions that you'll have to do  your own research and come to your own  conclusions  this article here asks a question how  might the future of homework be affected  by this AI program referring to that GPT  and that's an interesting question  because let's say you're a student that  has to answer some type to write a paper  if you have a sophisticated chatbot you  can ask that to prompt and then they can  generate a response for you so how could  that affect the future of homework and  how can teachers position themselves to  be able to recognize if the student does  this or is a student doing that even an  ethical concern because that is a tool  they have at their disposal but perhaps  they should just be using their own  brains to generate throughout theirs and  not relying on the external system so  who's right and wrong can help you deal  with that going forward once again I  don't have the answers to these  questions  the last ethical concern I want to touch  on in today's video is that uh father  nation and artificial intelligence and  unemployment namely we'll chat GPT  replace Riders and I don't really have  the answer to this question there's been  a lot of times in economics history in  which some new invention has come around  and people are scared of Automation and  sometimes those jobs are automated  sometimes they weren't sometimes people  that were automated were able to spend  their time or find better jobs to spend  their time doing other things because  they have more Leisure Time and  sometimes that didn't happen so what  will the future of artificial  intelligence be like and what will this  impact Beyond unemployment or employment  or what jobs look like or which portion  of jobs are automated how much leisure  time will people have how would the  revenue be distributed that are created  from these systems those are questions  that will have to be answered in the  future  and please like comment and subscribe  and when you subscribe make sure you  click that notification
