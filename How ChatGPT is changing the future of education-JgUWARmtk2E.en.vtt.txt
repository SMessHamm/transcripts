 Chant, GPT. It is the latest and greatest technological advancement that set the Internet on fire. Now, one of the biggest talkers surrounding this new artificial intelligence program is its potential impact on schools. And tonight, TV elevens. Rolly Hoyt breaks down what it is and how educators are working to stay one step ahead. So what exactly is chat GPT? Let's start with the source we asked the artificial intelligence program itself. Chat GPT is a conversational AI model developed by open AI trained on a large corpus of text data to generate human like responses to various prompts for a human answer, here's Phillip Huff, UA Little Rock assistant professor in cybersecurity. So chat GPT is a large language model, and what that means is it has taken the language across the. Internet and several linguists have come together to create artificial intelligence that is really good at understanding our language. Basically, you can ask chat GPT questions or give it prompts, and it's been programmed to generate a response like this when you ask it to write an essay on the cause of the American Revolution. Chat GPT came out back in November. Since then, you may have seen concerns about students using it to cheat on school assignments, with some districts even banning it. It's a potential. Issue Rachel Blackwell with the Plaski County Special School District says they're aware of, but she sees chat GPT as an opportunity, not a threat. Academic honesty is huge and you want to make sure that students are writing in their own voice and and using their own thoughts. But I think at the same time as exciting and thinking about how can we can reutilize this or take this program and create new lesson plans, create new ideas and new ways to work with students. Blackwell points out that technology is always. Evolving and it's important for schools too as well. It's not going away. I mean, things are gonna change and we have to just change with it. We need to educate our students on what's out there and we just need to prepare them, Huff says. It's about adapting. Teachers need to find ways to shape their lessons and assignments to push students creativity beyond what programs like chat GPT can do. That's an adaptation we as educators need to provide. The students still welcome the technology, help them understand the technology. But also don't let, don't let it serve as a replacement for their critical thinking skills. Another important thing to keep in mind training educators how to properly utilize the technology. We just have to really think about how we can, what are the benefits and the positives of this, and how we can train our teachers and just make sure that they feel prepared in a world that's going to be changing. As far as cheating goes, even chat GPT is quick to point out that students shouldn't do it. No cheating and school goes against the principles of academic integrity and honesty. Additionally, using a language model like chat, GPT to complete assignments or take tests undermines the purpose of education, which is to learn and develop critical thinking skills in Little Rock. Rolly Hoyt, THV 11 news. Now, one other thing to point out about chat GPT it's free to use online. And when it comes to training educators, PCSSD says plans are already in the works to do it this summer.
