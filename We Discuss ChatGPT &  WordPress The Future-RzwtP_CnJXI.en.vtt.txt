I've had a  good Christmas holiday you didn't do  much didn't do as much as I wanted to do  last week but I still had a break I feel  a little bit  re-energized for having a little break  um  so um I just want to point out also  we've got some great special offers from  our sponsors plus we've got a courage  list of the best plugins and services if  you're looking to build something on  WordPress to get all these goodies and  advice that will save you a ton of time  you just need to go over to WP tectonic  strike backslash  deals WP tonic slash deals and you get  that all there so  let's go into it  um  chat GPT so what's your um I've got so  I've got some views about it but I'll be  interested to hear what's your overall  opinion of it and you know it's been a  it's been in the news consistently for  the last three six months have those  views changed so over to you oh uh have  the views changed that's that's that's  the big question Jonathan hey I'm a  convert because I put it off as long as  humanly possible I wanted nothing to do  with AI and I think it's a human pride  thing because I consider myself a writer  and a Content developer so I was like no  I'm going to write my own stuff I don't  need some fake you know some fake voice  um but then I tried a couple of AI tools  and uh when I landed on chat GPT I was I  was actually kind of shocked at how well  it worked  so is that been it then  well no so um you know we've got some  experience with with Bertha AI on some  of the WordPress platforms that we that  we build you and I Jonathan and uh you  know I've played around with Bertha a  little bit I want to make sure I can you  know be of service to customers and  clients and all that and be familiar  with tools but I still felt like  I wanted to write my own content  um and then when chat GPT was getting  all that press I said man I gotta I  gotta try something and so I put in a  question I was going to write a blog  post and I thought well well what are  some reasons that people fail at online  courses like what could I add value to  people with and so I just put in the  question why do some people fail online  courses  dude it's within like three to five  seconds it spit out a paragraph bullets  and then extended a paragraph for each  of the bullets  and when I reviewed the content  I'm not lying it was like I wrote it  like I was looking at it and I was going  that's exactly what I that's exactly  what I would have wrote  um and so I added a paragraph here and  there I put some personal flares on it I  added a couple of pictures and next  thing you know I got a blog post now  that blog post took me eight to ten  minutes when normally I'd spend an hour  or an hour and 15 minutes writing that  kind of content  so I can definitely see the draw I can  see why people would be interested in it  and then I've learned if I combine chat  GPT with another tool that I've relied  on in the past it becomes like this this  just Powerhouse of content ideas and  fulfillment  what's this a little  it's been around forever a lot of folks  use it called answer the public it's a  website and so when you go to answer the  public  I think it's a.com when you go to  answerthepublic.com  um you can put in any subject like so  you could put in you know hosting  e-learning courses you know Ford Chevy  motorcycles whatever and it in real time  will kind of aggregate a graphic that is  what are people asking about that  subject in real time and so you'll see  like a percentage of so many people are  asking about how is it made so many  people are asking about how is it sold  but you get like  hundreds of questions about that subject  matter and then if you just look at the  top section of the most frequently asked  questions if you take one of those  questions and then put that in the chat  GPT  you know that your content is basically  hitting the sweet spot for that subject  matter for what people are actively  searching for at that moment  yeah thanks for that  um  one of the interesting bits for me Kirk  about this whole thing was that the  company behind  these Technologies which is open a AI  um it's how I wrote a few months before  Christmas I wrote a piece about open AI  which is a non-profit company it's a  commercial business but it's a  non-profit and what intrigued me at the  time was the amount of money that  Microsoft had invested in the business  so yeah they were one of the largest  there were there are other investors VCS  other large corporate investors but one  of the largest individual  contributors has been Microsoft and I  just I was a little puzzled  um  why they will invest in so much money in  it but  I thought well they know what they're  doing blah blah blah but I was a little  bit  it just it just didn't  register to me and now  I think it's become the much much  clearer why they invested in this  company and it basically it's payback  time for Google  and to put it simply  um obviously  um  Microsoft's attempts in the search  engine have not been that successful  Google uh basically dominate search  um  this technology chat GPT  you can you know there's been quite a  few commentators and influencers on  YouTube making content that basically  you put a question in you you'll get a  better result a lot of the time than  Google  and that that is partly down to the  quality of search from Google being  reduced you know it ever increasing the  amount of paid adverts  um positioning  um new ways of showing our answer to a  question then then the classical you  know way of listing external  Pages used in artificial intelligence to  supply a clip of information which a lot  of the time isn't that sometimes it  works well sometimes it doesn't so the  in my opinion the quality of Google  searches deteriorated quite a bit over  the last 18 months  um  so I see this really is Microsoft really  attempting  to  get Market position what do you think of  what I'm just outlining do you think I'm  on the right track or do you think I've  got that Ron  I think there's somewhat of that track  and and I have to agree with you on  Google search I mean there's the amount  of censorship and almost seemingly  misdirection and things that don't even  seem related to political matters you  can't it's like I'll look something up  on Google and I don't find what I want I  open up a separate browser yeah I do  really mean I just mean General search I  mean yeah and you're trying to find  something out yeah so you're looking for  something and you don't see it and then  you open up another browser and there it  is and so and I don't know the Rhyme or  Reason of why that's like that lately  but um yeah I do money  so  um so I would agree that the Google  search has has declined the other thing  that I wondered was you know what's the  revenue pattern for this because  everything I've done in chat GPT so far  has been free  yeah it's free so what's the revenue  model well then they've already publicly  stated that they they will be charging  for the technology but you know but it  will be a fat fraction of a cent  you get that with um already  um assisted writing apps like Bertha  um and Javelin and there's a number of  them out there yeah now  um  how will this affect the world of  Wordpress well one of the one of the  direct ways that I can see it affecting  is curation and being able  um as we've had a few guests on the show  recently and one of the topics that red  leagues come out is how you know  WordPress has enormous strengths but one  of its weaknesses it is a glorified flea  market  um  um obviously trying to make that  situation easier for users is fraught  with financial and political  problems because by giving a curated  list or removing others  they're not going to be very welcome I  mean obviously for very  understandable business reasons about  them being excluded from something  um yeah so automatic wordpress.org  have on purpose  really been extremely resistant apart  from letting the popularity of a  particular theme  and plugging be the only  um  Dominator that  would put you on top of a list  because you're obviously going to  wordpress.org and you're doing a search  there for your Plugin or theme to come  up at the top it's been extremely  important  that we've found that people would be  new to lies in various techniques to  manipulate  um the basic functionality there  and also I think slightly its importance  was ex which was extremely important a  couple of years ago has been in Decline  as well what's your thoughts about that  the flea market aspect with the six what  is it 60 000 plus plugins that are  available for WordPress or something  like that's a crazy number right huge  yeah the when I found out that you could  use chat GPT to write a a WordPress  plugin via AI I thought well that's  going to be messy code like like no  one's auditing it right like like they  could just be gluing stuff together and  then you're gonna have everything they  tell me that anyway  well but then you'll have every Tom Dick  and Harry out there you know I'm not a  developer anyway  fair enough but but you know now an  implementer goes to chat GPT and says  hey chat GPT make me a plug-in that does  X Y and Z God forbid it works you know  then they go oh that's awesome I'm going  to submit it or I'm gonna promote it or  I'm gonna whatever and I'm afraid it's  gonna bloat the market with a bunch of  half-working nonsensical stuff that  people are gonna have to Wade through to  find stuff they really want or is  effective well I think that's the  position as it is  um but it'll get worse yeah after time  um but no I I do honestly think Croatian  um utilizing  um  this technology to help assist people in  finding the right setup for their  particular needs  um  from input they give in a in a method  that's affordable  um I think we I think we're gonna see  more and more  creationed services  that have this I think the elephant  about this technology is it it's  overplayed to some extent because it's  not in it's not alive it's definitely  not intelligent it's using the native  ability of code and computers and the  speed to it's it's  so it gives the impression  um the so it's a it's a little bit of a  con in some ways but because it works  and it works more effectively this  particular form of Technology it it  gives  um  I think the other factor that hasn't  been taught is that  when you take some of the content and it  provides and you and you put it into a  copyright Checker  um it normally doesn't come back  Flags has been directly scraped  um  and it is scraping it's just more  sophisticated scraping yeah it's going  um my understanding but there there is a  fair bit of confusion around this that  it is scraping to some but it's a more  sophisticated form of scraping and it  uses the technology to combine different  sources and it has parameters so it  won't trigger  um  uh that it  it's it's taking so it doesn't flag up  copy infringement  um but it is graping and I think it's  one of the drawbacks because as as this  technology is utilized more and more and  more that more of it will be to produce  from a ever ever smaller original group  of Articles and pieces that were written  from real people so  um I think that I think this whole  where it's scraping where it got  original material and then it adapted it  I think there's going to be a lot of  pushback about people saying well it's  obvious they're going to use other AI  technology to be able to say well you've  done this but we can clearly see that  you got it from our original content  um so I think there's going to be a bit  of more pushback about  um  where they got this content to write  this is this making any sense or do you  think I'm off no no it it is and and for  me you know I'm a parent got kids I'm  involved with kids at church all that  and it's um from a societal standpoint  it is pretty scary because think about a  kid has to write an essay for English  class he just goes into chat GPT puts in  a subject has an essay and submits it  done and I think back to the days when I  was in school and they would said okay  no calculators in math class because you  know you're not gonna have calculators  with you all the time right and then  then we end up with calculators then we  ended up with phones right who needs to  know math now when you can when you got  everything in your phone  um there's there's not much that we  can't  search and it's like the dumbing down of  society it's like you look at what you  know look at what Franklin and Jefferson  and and Washington wrote I know you're  from England I just named a bunch of  Americans  look at what Churchill wrote  um  he was drunk when he was drawing  but you you look at the vocabulary and  you look at the the sentence structure  and you can sense you know a little bit  of intelligence there and then you you  look at how we've progressed with  technology and how that technology while  it's great to use  um has really I think weakened the core  intelligence of people  that makes us lazy  I don't really I don't actually agree  with that but I do understand where  you're coming from I think it's a very I  think it's a very populistic view I  think I think there are some irritating  habits that have  um I've the reason why I say that just  before we go for our break is  um it's a bit I don't know if you're  aware of  um the Hearst and the Hearst Family and  and you know you ever gone to Hearst  Castle in Northern California  um never went to the castle you haven't  been it's really fantastic actually it's  a national it's a California National  um  Park and the actual relay it's a villa  kind of straight Castle  um is spectacular actually  um but um  Hearst and um he bought a number of  papers and he was involved in a form of  Journalism called yellow yellow  journalism which was a form of  tabloid the modern day former tabloid  journalism and some of the things that  yours you know and it was extremely  controversial  um about how you utilize it as a as a  propaganda  uh mythology but  um some of the things that you're that  you were just saying was said in the  1920s and the early 30s about yellow  journalism and about tabloid journalism  um so those fears and observations I  feel have been there for quite a while  but you might be right  um we're going to go for a break we'll  be back in a few moments folks  thank you  we're coming back I'd like to point out  if you're a WordPress pal user a develop  a graphic designer and you're looking  for a great WordPress hosting provider  look at wptonic especially if you're  building a website

that are the best of  breed to help you build that for your  client plus as a WordPress as a WP  partner you'll get 40 of the initial  purchase from your client plus you will  earn 20 year after year so it is a  tremendous partnership and a tremendous  Financial Partnership if that sounds  interesting go over to WP tonic slash  partners I'm going to repeat that WP  tonic slash partners and you can sign up  to become a WP partner me or Kirk will  have a chat with you and we would love  you to come on board and work with WP  tonic  so back into what we've been talking  about chat GPT  um  yeah so I see like I said um I see  Croatian being one of the main factors  it affects WordPress also the graphic  side  um one of the one of the ways  um you see this on appsuma is  um there's a number of SEO  um hybrid  products on appsuma  um also been on the General market  um that  um look at your content  um advise you advise you how to improve  Thai tools improve words and dents and  see your key phrases in either helping  you write new content but give you an  outline of a document help you with  certain paragraphs and then basically  they're mimicking the same technology  that Google's been using for the past  two to three years  um it's another threat  um you know helps you produce better I  use also there's a number of  um  copy assistance very like Jarvis and  um aimed at I've bought a couple of them  that help with long-form content so  um but I do really see them as a  assistance  um I see them as aides to help you make  help you produce content quicker  but also help you improve content I  don't I'm also very excited about how  you know we bought into Bertha early  um I understand from you know we had  Adam Pressler on  um that Adam's gonna be entering this  Market as well I think he said he  mentioned it didn't it I think it's  going to be called sure writer  um he will be in the near food chains  and in that but um I'm quite excited  about how this is going to help course  um people building membership education  courses helping them write more  effective content because I think this  is one of the most any any kind of also  goes into the general area a lot you  know if you ever worked with clients  it's one of the main hurdles you know  having blank pages or pages and having  to write content it's  should help or do you think  I'm just being optimistic there it's not  really gonna help  oh customers and content that seems to  be a contention Jonathan I don't know if  anything's gonna fix that  um I I don't know what it is about  everyone has a great idea but nobody you  know can write it down on a piece of  paper and hand it to you to put on a  website  um it's uh it'll be interesting and and  I wonder if these AI tools will become  so ubiquitous and so easy to use like  you know people using a smartphone  um I wonder if it'll become so easy that  people will begin to use it and  implement it right or if it's always  going to be that extra step that the  average person doesn't do like we're  kind of like in the tech world and we  think things are exciting and we go and  check this stuff out but like on a  percentage basis of population I'd  really be curious to see how many people  have really tried it and and tried to  really do something cool with it you  know what I mean  well you've got to use it right one of  the problems is even with something like  birth and I know it's dependent on  um  there's a certain  you can't they would deny this and I'm  just not  frowning this around Bertha I think it's  any of these tools Java Jarvis any of  them  um  there's a knack you have to learn how to  work with them there's enough to it  um you can't just straight go in and  think you're gonna get fantastic results  you you're gonna have to do a little bit  of a dive and read some  um help  documentational videos about how it  works and try it out and practice a  little bit with any of these  um  writing assisting assistance platforms  apps as I call them  um because you're going to be a bit  disappointed I've already spoken to a  few people that just dived in and they  just gave up on it straight away and  they said well I could write this I  could write this quicker than utilize  this  um so it does really depend on um so  what I'm saying is don't lose patience  as quickly  um if you're a really good writer it's  just going to help you maybe produce  more content  um  but it's not going to replace you those  that find it hard it's just gonna it  should be a mechanism that helps you  get over that hump but I'm not even sure  about that because you you are going to  have to study the platform that you're  going to be utilizing it's like it's  like anything isn't it you know  um some people say oh well  um Shopify is so much easier than  woocommerce well I do actually agree  with that  um  if you just you know because you are  gonna have to jump through a few extra  Loops but you get all the benefits of  ownership and flexibility blah blah blah  um but on our land like something like  Shopify or or in the membership area  kajabi when people say oh it's much so  so much easier WordPress well it really  depends where you're coming from it  really depends on what your personal  experience is there's a there's a lot  more to that statement  um it's a lot more faceted than what a  lot of people  my cow and I really see the same with  these  um with these writing tools  um  um I also think  um we're on the early day and I know  um Chris  um from  um Nifty lms's  um in his own personal marketing utilize  these um and it's really cool but  obviously at some stage it's going to be  overdone but I think we are on the very  early days of  of  um I really think you can clearly see  it's he is going to disrupt the writing  sector but also I really think it's  going to really  um disrupt to some extent the graphic  side as well do you think I'm right  about that  I I think you are correct uh about the  graphics and and kind of disrupting that  space or  and I hate to say it out loud but  possibly you know devaluing you know  what someone's willing to pay for  graphics because people think all of a  sudden they can like you can go to Brand  crowd and have a logo done you know for  35 50 bucks whatever it is or you can  hire a graphic designer and  people begin to misunderstand or  convince themselves that the cheap way  is the way for them and then they pay  the price in in quality you know and I'm  just wondering how good this AI is going  to be able to move and manipulate with  people's needs  and possibly replace or devalue you know  the real world  yeah I I can see exactly where you're  coming from then if you're not sorry  about it I think it's been developed  it's already buying like services like  99 designs and the one you mentioned I  think they've devoured a certain type of  clientele  um but they were always extremely  difficult to deal with anyway to say  when you ever even  um you put the price of  I'm not super expensive but a reasonable  price to get a reasonably experienced  graphic design and help them do it like  they would bulk at it anyway they would  get their nephew or their brother to  knock something up and it tended to be  horrendous  um  but  um that was always there anyway  depending on the on the budget of the  client to some extent you know it it may  go the other way it may become the best  filter in the world to get rid of  deadbeats and clients that you don't  want it might be the the greatest filter  in the world to bring the premium  clients to the people that are really  skilled  um I think I think in some ways you  touched on the thing I think the problem  where I think that where this um I don't  really think it will affect the really  cheap side or the really upper side I  think it's the middle Market that uh in  web development and in design that it's  um probably gonna affect a bit more  um it might you know in some way you  know there's already  um the elephant is  um I've got the services there's a  there's like two to three services that  you put in the parameters of the website  and they build the whole website for you  using  um using chat GPT and I I that's when I  was getting back to the creation because  I see this creation  um mechanisms  um we're on the early stages and I I  haven't tried any of these um supposedly  um AI supported you put some parameters  and it and it flews out but it's not  that you know  um through blocks you know which is  Gutenberg you know more and more  websites are going to effectively gonna  be a mixture of different blocks  pre-developed  um  this um one of our friends of the show  that I have a regular podcast with um  Spencer Forum it's one of his  um key pointers you know more and more  it's utilizing existing leg up they go  bricks at knowing which the best Legos  and how to put them together and I do  agree to him I think you can see that  with Gutenberg blocks  um that um you're gonna and which AI  um  can be part of choosing the right  blocks to put into a more Quasar  customizable solution for a particular  client can you see where I'm going with  this do you think I might be on the  right track  I do yeah it's I think the options are  going to be Limitless honestly it's when  you listen to like Jordan Peterson and  some other really like  celebrated people online talk about this  chat GPT and and AI they forecast  something a year or two down the road  that is something that you know my brain  can't even wrap around right now  probably it's probably for the best that  you don't actually  but it's like you know it's gonna do  this it's going to do that it's going to  do and then you want every every day of  it we get closer to Terminator there we  go but uh uh I think we better wrap up  the show now so Kirk what is the best  way for people to find out more about  you your thoughts and your company Kurt  well Manana Nomas is my company name so  if you go to mananomas.com uh you'll be  able to find me and anything you search  for manyana Namaz online is typically me  it's all over and then I'm a big person  on LinkedIn uh if you want to go and  find me out on LinkedIn that's the  easiest way to get a hold of me message  me we'll set up a meet and greet we'll  do a break the ice call and we'll see  how we can add value to each other I'd  love to meet you yeah and uh folks do  remember to go to the wp tonic slash  Partners look at our Pacific hosting  partnership plans  um you get Great Commission and you get  access as as WP tonic as your partner to  build membership Learning Management  systems for your clientele it's a great  platform and a great Partnerships that  go over there we'll be back next week  with hopefully a great guess we've got  some great guests booked up in January  and in February  um Plus at the end of each month we're  going to be doing  um the wp tonic Round Table show
