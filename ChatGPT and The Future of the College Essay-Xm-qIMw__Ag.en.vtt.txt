 foreign  podcast the place to be if your child  wants to attend a top-tier college a  military service Academy or they want to  earn an ROTC or athletic scholarship I'm  Phil black your host and my job is to  prepare you and your child for this  amazing journey so sit back buckle up  and prepare to out prepare  Hello friends and welcome back to the  prep World podcast in today's episode I  want to discuss the latest potential  challenge to the integrity and veracity  of the college admissions process  specifically the essay section of the  college application  and yes as you may have guessed I'm  talking about chat GPT  chat GPT for those of you who haven't  caught wind of it yet is the name of a  new piece of AI software that can crank  out a machine generated college essay  with minimal inputs that is nearly  indistinguishable from a genuine essay  written by an actual student  and believe me I was skeptical at first  until I saw it happen right before my  eyes  and to make this a little less  theoretical and more practical I'm going  to share with you right now  the chat GPT college essay response that  I just received on my computer seconds  after I typed in what I wanted the  program to do  here is exactly what I typed into the  search bar  write me a 650 word essay following this  Common App essay prompt  some students have a background identity  interest or talent that is so meaningful  they believe their application would be  incomplete without it if this sounds  like you then please share your story  mention that you live in New York  that your parents are divorced and you  do ocean research on coral reefs in  Jamaica  enter  now those last three details were  completely made up by me off the top of  my head  but they could be true  and within 30 seconds  this is what the computer spit out while  I watched here we go  growing up in New York I've always been  surrounded by the hustle and bustle of  the city but my true passion lies in the  Stillness of the ocean  my parents divorced when I was young and  I found solace in the ocean's embrace it  was my Escape My Sanctuary  as I got older I became more and more  fascinated by the intricacies of marine  life and I knew I wanted to make a  career out of studying it  I first got involved in Ocean research  through a program at my school that  focused on coral reef conservation in  Jamaica I immediately fell in love with  the work and the culture and I knew I  had found my calling I have now been  going to Jamaica every summer for the  past three years to work on a research  project that focuses on the impact of  climate change on coral reefs I have  seen firsthand how devastating the  effects of climate change can be on  these delicate ecosystems and I am  dedicated to doing everything I can to  protect and conserve them for future  Generations being a part of this  research project has been one of the  most meaningful experiences of my life  it has not only solidified my desire to  pursue a career in Marine Biology but  has also helped me to understand the  importance of taking action and using my  passion to make a difference I truly  believe that my experience with ocean  research in Jamaica is a vital aspect  effect of who I am and my application  would be incomplete without it I am  grateful for the opportunity to share my  story and I look forward to continue  this journey with more passion and  dedication in the future  now that essay may not win a Pulitzer  but it's certainly not chopped liver  either  in fact I have never gotten anything  remotely this good from a student as a  first draft and yes there are plenty of  cliches yes it's pretty generic yes it's  a hundred percent made up out of thin  air  but you have to admit that the bones are  not too bad  and a resourceful student could tweak  some of these details in 10 minutes and  have something that's probably better  than that they would have produced on  their own sometimes a lot better  and it took under one minute to do  pretty wild huh if you play around with  this for a few minutes it will blow your  mind  this application can do just about  anything I'm talking thank you notes  wedding vows poems workout routines  nutrition plans original recipes church  sermons keynote addresses marketing copy  day trading protocols obituaries breakup  notes songs  best man speeches book reports movie  reviews  dating app profiles  I'm serious it does all of this and more  and in most cases you wouldn't be able  to tell the difference between human and  computer generated  so what does this mean in a big scheme  of things is it a good thing is it a bad  thing is it a fad is it irrelevant is it  dangerous  now I'm not going to comment on the  larger cultural educational and societal  implications of this technology I'm sure  there will be books written about this  and fortunes made by some cunning  entrepreneur but I will offer my  thoughts on how it might impact College  admissions essays first off if you're an  avid listener to this podcast you could  probably rattle off several of the many  ways that college applications have  become over time less and less shall we  say informative for college admissions  officers  they have become so watered down and  have so few objective measures left to  assess  it's almost laughable  and with the prospect of computers now  writing essays like the one I just read  to you  in 30 seconds it's possible that the  integrity and the value of college  applications may get even worse  let's do a quick review  over the last few years and by few I  mean three to four years the following  has happened number one gpas have become  suspect due to rampant grade inflation  these days a 4.6 GPA it's a yawner it's  not particularly special  number two submitting sat or ACT test  scores is now optional at most schools  and even prohibited at other schools  these are test blind schools number  three no more SAT subject tests these  used to be 60-minute end-of-year exams  that allowed students to show their  Proficiency in high school classes and  they were compared Across the Nation no  longer number four no more sat essay  section which used to be the only way  that colleges could evaluate an  applicant's contemporaneous writing  ability  meaning writing without editing without  help from a parent or a tutor or a  teacher or a College advisor  number five not submitting AP exam  scores has become a thing  that's not recommended  but it's happening  and for many AP classes writing ability  was often correlated with how well you  did on your AP exam score because it  required contemporaneous writing in  those blue books  and lastly number six  some schools no longer even accept  letters of recommendations from teachers  this is the way it is in University of  California schools  this used to be one of the few ways that  admissions officers could differentiate  students from one another by soliciting  the opinions of adults who've had a lot  of exposure to the students not anymore  and by the way for the colleges that  still do require letters of  recommendation how long do you think it  will be before teachers start using chat  GPT to write letters of recommendation  for students  we'll talk a little bit more on that  later  like many controversial things whether  chat GPT is good or bad often depends on  the context in which it's being used is  it all bad probably not is it all good  certainly not  so let's explore the differences  let's start out with some pros  what good might come out of chat GPT as  it relates to the college admissions  process in particular essay writing  let me rephrase that so I won't get in  trouble with my wife  what good will students perceive there  to be by using chat GPT  in other words I'm not advocating that  students should use this  but I do want you to know what your  child might be thinking and why your  child might be tempted to go down this  path Pro number one  in my experience  many students are poor writers in fact  some are dismally poor writers as I've  suggested many times on this podcast  and I'm talking about students who get  A's in every English class  from the beginning of time including AP  Language and Composition and from what  I've seen a chat GPT essay absolutely  blows away the majority of what I would  see from the first draft of one of my  private students not all but many  specifically when it comes to grammar  and punctuation organization coherence  and flow that doesn't mean the chat GPT  essay is particularly compelling it just  means that it blows away what most  students are producing on their own  these days  and this fact will not be lost on many  students so I would not be surprised if  your child became chat GPT curious  Pro number two if your child is applying  to a college that has an essay  requirement but the essay doesn't count  very much and it's waiting  this is often the case at big state  schools where they don't have the time  or the manpower to read that many essays  why should they waste their time  trying to craft a perfect essay that  will probably not even be read  why not crank out a chat GPT essay edit  it for accuracy and send it their time  might be better spent elsewhere again  I'm not advocating for this  rather I'm trying to get you and the  head of your child so that you know  what's going on  Pro number three  what if your child is a super stem  student and all they care about is math  and physics or engineering and they're  not a particularly strong writer nor are  they claiming to be a reading and  writing type on their applications  but they know they have to be at least a  respectable writer  well chat GPT might get them there in  pretty short order I'm talking in 30  seconds so if your child finds  themselves  staring at a blank page with no idea  where to even start or how to organize  their essay or their thoughts  and their grammar isn't so good chat GPT  might be very tempting  because sometimes it takes a student  like this something in writing to get  them going and once they have a  framework an example they can make some  tweaks and end up in a much better place  versus banging their head against the  wall with no starting point now the risk  of course is that the student changes  one or two words and submits it as their  own work  is this ethical probably not  and Beyond the ethical question I'm not  sure this is a sustainable plan  but maybe it gets them through some of  their applications  let's get into some of the cons to using  chat GPT  con number one chat GPT May generate an  essay with things that are factually  incorrect  and if your child doesn't care to check  they could be outed con number two if  there's a suspicion that your child's  essay was artificially engineered it may  taint the reader and paint them in a bad  light now do they want to take that risk  con number three if your child is such a  bad writer or so lazy that they feel  like they need to use chat GPT  even if it's widely thought to be  unethical  and they're willing to roll the dice  then they may have bigger problems than  just essay writing  con number four what if your child  theoretically gets into a college based  in part on their fake chat GPT essays  what happens when they get to the  college  and they really don't know how to write  do they keep this facade going  indefinitely at some point the gig's  going to be up do they really want to  live like this will this eat away at  them you know it may have been more  worth it to learn how to write from the  beginning and not have to live with this  lie  con number five  what if chat GPT becomes a crutch what  if they begin to use it for everything  so much so that they even begin to lose  their ability to write at all  and then what would happen if chat GPT  got shut down or censored or it was put  behind a paywall or made illegal  and your child is then left to his or  her own devices  there's a high risk for imposter  syndrome here  con number six what if an application  comes out which can detect whether or  not chat GPT was used and your child  gets called out and has to prove that  they're capable of such writing and  they're given a writing test  would they fall apart  this happens when students claim to be  fluent in a foreign language when  they're really not and then they're  asked to conduct an interview in that  foreign language con number seven  what about the ethics of the issue the  common app asks you  if your essay represents your own work  is your child comfortable answering yes  if a computer generated it for them con  number eight would your child want their  teachers to use chat GPT to write their  letters of recommendation if not why not  what would be missing they should keep  this in mind when deciding whether or  not to use the app for their personal  statement when trying to communicate  their life's most profound perspectives  and values and insights  con number nine as impressive as chat  GPT appears to be at first blush  especially when the alternative is  staring at a blank page  it still writes at least for now pretty  generic stayed and unadventurous prose  and this is the opposite of what the  best college essays will do writing  generically can be the death knell for  an essay at the more selective schools  so if your child wants to be competitive  at those types of schools I would be  very wary about using chat GPT the last  thing they want to do  is submit an essay that lacks soul  con number 10 writing equals thinking  that's why writing is not easy it  requires your child to sit  and think and concentrate and work  things out in their mind  if they begin to Outsource their writing  they are for all intents and purposes  Outsourcing their thinking and that's a  very slippery slope  and lastly con number 11 and this might  be the biggest con of all  using chat GPT we'll short-circuit one  of the most important parts of the  college admissions process the part  where your child sits down and reflects  on their life  they review important Milestones  anecdotes UPS Downs good times and bad  traumas celebrations stresses struggles  victories big wins all in an effort to  distill down a few of their life's most  important values and insights  for all of the private students that I  work with on college essays  fundamental part of their growth curve  their maturation their development  they are for lack of a better word  forced to think about their lives their  opinions their World Views they're  forced to consider  what they've learned over the last 17  years  and they're challenged to turn some of  these findings into a compelling piece  of prose that communicates to the reader  what they care about what they value  what they've learned  not only will chat GPT miss the mark on  this  but using this bot as a way to avoid  that deep introspection in my opinion is  a bad idea  do we really want to take away one of  the few times  that your child has to think about their  life  I can't tell you how many students I've  worked with  who were so grateful for all of the  brainstorming sessions and debates and  ideas leading up to that final product  that they submitted their personal  statement  it's an important milestone for a 17  year old and not one that I would  Outsource to an AI machine  I've had many students tell me that our  work together on their essays  was the first time that anyone ever gave  them actual real-time feedback on their  writing  they've told me that during our work  together that they've learned more about  grammar and spelling and punctuation and  sentence structure and subject verb  agreement and style and outlining and  organization than they did in all of  their English classes combined because  these days whether we like it or not  one-on-one work with an English teacher  is pretty rare  in my experience students are just not  getting the type of instruction that  they need or they deserve  and to give up all of that learning and  growth  so that a bot can crank out a generic  sounding essay in 30 seconds  seems like a pretty big lost opportunity  so on balance  I hope it's come across loud and clear  that I'm not in love with the idea of  using chat GPT for college essays it's  fraught with risk  and I would proceed with caution  especially at the more selective schools  where your child will be fighting for  every inch of differentiation  and the essay readers at those schools  are particularly astute  some of them have read tens of thousands  of college essays  and it's likely that they'll be able to  see a chat GPT essay from a mile away  does your child want to take that chance  now to be a devil's advocate some people  might argue that using chat GPT is just  a tool it's no different from using a  calculator or grammarly or a dictionary  or a thesaurus or Wikipedia  I'm not so sure about that a calculator  for example helps you to find an  objective answer a black and white  indisputable answer the truth  that's not the same as your child  attempting to convey ideas and opinions  and feelings and nuance and subtlety  even when you use a calculator on math  problems the teacher typically also  wants to see your work how you got to  your final answer  because the teacher wants to see the  thought process you went through to make  sure you understand the concept  so that you can repeat that process or  apply that process in a different  scenario  if you just come up with the answer  who's to say that you didn't get the  answer from a friend or a group text or  online or by looking at your neighbor's  paper  the teacher wants to see your work  the same goes for writing except instead  of show your work the Mantra is do the  work and it will show  now will there be backlash will colleges  be inundated with these bot generated  essays that all look the same I don't  know if they do  will they care to do anything about it I  don't know  the way things have been trending I  would guess not  they could bring back the essay section  of the SAT or some other type of  contemporaneous writing evaluation they  could build software that detects chat  GPT content and flags it as inauthentic  in fact someone has already done that  they could start requesting writing  samples from one of your child's High  School classes  I know Princeton does this  my two older Sons had to submit a graded  writing sample from their English class  as part of their Princeton application  I'm not sure that there's an appetite to  turn back the clocks on this one but we  shall see  so how should your child handle this  I know this won't be popular with most  students but my suggestion is for them  to ignore chat GPT at least for now  strive to become a good writer the  old-fashioned way by doing the hard work  by brainstorming and outlining and  writing drafts and getting feedback and  starting over and writing another draft  and so on  have them find someone in their life be  it an older sibling a parent an English  teacher a mentor an essay specialist  like me and get feedback  and of course they should read read read  and read some more  which will make them a much better  writer  so that when they become a good writer  in their own right through hard work and  diligence  and chat GPT eventually becomes more  mainstream at least they'll know how to  edit and pick out errors and maybe even  inject some soul into the final product  that's all I've got for you today folks  thank you for tuning in thank you for  your continued support in case you
