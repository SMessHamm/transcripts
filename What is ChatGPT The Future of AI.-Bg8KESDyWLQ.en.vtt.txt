 I'm Liam and today we're talking about  chat gbt a fascinating and revolutionary  new technology that according to the CEO  of openai Sam Altman gained over a  million users in the first week of  launching at the end there's a big  surprise about this video in chat GMT in  general you might want to stay for it  shot gbt is a free Ai and chatbot  created last month that use the latest  in natural language processing  technology to understand and respond to  user input what this means is that you  can tell chat gbt to do something and  it'll do it just as an example if you  need a recipe for some Spanish pancakes  got it with instructions ingredients and  directions it tells you the full thing  and gives you everything you need to  know to make Spanish pancakes what sets  chat gbt apart from other chat Bots is  its ability to generate human-like  responses based on the input it receives  this means that unlike many other chat  Bots which can only provide  pre-programmed responses chat gbt can  engage in a near infinite number of  natural flowing conversations with the  users chat gbt is a text-based chat bot  so therefore it can do nearly any things  humans can do with text black right  Advanced python code for instance where  this tick tocker had Chad gbt generate  an entire profitable stock broking  program this is how I got chat GPT to  code a trading bot that's over two  thousand percent profitable so I plugged  this in it started coding it right in  front of my eye yep paste it all in and  let's name it AI trading box it can even  write poetry and essays if you're a  college or high school student you know  how difficult it can be to come up with  a topic research it and write a coherent  well-structured essay but with chat gbt  you can literally finish nearly any  prompt or essay in seconds simply tell  Chad gbt what your essay is about and  then it'll use this natural language  processing capabilities to generate  ideas find relevant information and even  write entire paragraphs for you this can  help you save an extreme amount of time  and effort and help you produce better  quality essays than you could have  written shot gbt is a really cool  technology it uses the most modern and  newly developed natural language  processing to understand and respond to  user input in a way that feels natural  in human life no other AI are doing this  to this extent right now and it's  constantly learning and improving with  each question the world asks it before  using Chad gbt you need to create an  account which makes you agree to let  Chad gbt learn from your questions too  so it's getting better and better all  the time and even faster as more people  around the world use it one of the most  impressive things about Chad gbt is its  ability to understand and respond to a  wide range of topics whether you want to  talk about history your favorite hobbies  or complex scientific Concepts chai gbt  is up to the task it can even pick up on  nuances and subtleties and conversation  making it feel more like a real  conversation with a human than one with  an AI okay who is open AI in short  openai is the parent company that made  chat gbt well I was wondering why they  would release such an incredible  technology for free because this really  is incredible and the company's main  goal is promoting and developing  friendly AI in a way that benefits  Humanity as a whole their trailer for  child has seen on their website has some  really good interviews that show where  the open ai's team's mind is at here's  the video imagine the wildest idea that  you've ever had and you're curious about  how it might scale to something that's  hundred a thousand times bigger this is  a place where you can get to do that  openai is building the general  technologies that can extend the reach  of the human brain and our creativity  and gpt3 is a system that has a robust  understanding of language  our mission is to create highly capable  AI Technologies and deploy them to the  world for the benefit of humanity in a  way that is safe and beneficial for all  I think that AI will be a technological  Revolution on the scale of the  Agricultural the industrial the computer  Revolution and we have no goal other  than the creation and deployment of safe  beneficial AGI I really like the way  open AI are trying to build HEI namely  by harnessing large amounts of real  world data to train powerful and  supervised models and then steering  those with human alignment to create  agents that can actually do useful  things people are really both friendly  and approachable and ambitious there's  this shared sense of we're going to do  something very very big together we've  set our sights high and also we're  collaborating together to make that  happen I I truly believe that the  technology we are creating is going to  have a really profound impact can we  create an environment where we have ai  and Technology broadly amplifying human  wisdom giving humans another resource  for connecting with  what's actually important to them what's  actually gives them meaning  Living in America I'm used to most  businesses and corporations squeezing  every last sentin dime drive from  consumers see a company that genuinely  just wants better Society improve the  world is really just like a great thing  not very common how does chat JBC even  work well at its core it uses two things  a vast amount of data and a type of  artificial intelligence called a  language model I'm not going to go deep  into it but it's similar to technology  using many virtual assistants like  serial Alexa it's much more advanced and  can handle many more interactions than  its competitors though in order to  generate human-like responses a chatbot  needs to understand the patterns and  smaller nuances of human language and  the best way to do that is to expose it  to as much real world data as possible  that's where the vast amounts of data  come in before release ciao gbt had to  be trained in hundreds of thousands of  conversations ranging from casual chats  between friends to more formal  discussions about complex topics this  allowed us to learn the intricacies of  human language and to generate responses  that are more natural and human-like  than those of other chat Bots  but how was this data collected well it  was gathered from a variety of sources  including social media forms and even  transcripts of real life conversations  this wide range of data allowed Chad gbt  to learn from a diverse set of voices  and language Styles which helped to  become more versatile and capable of  handling a wider range of interactions  so why is Chad gbt so important well for  one thing it represents a major and I  mean major step forward the field of  intelligent AI it's a glimpse into a  future where we can have seamless  natural conversations with Advanced and  maybe even near sentient artificial  intelligence however there are also some  potential drawbacks to try gbt like  everything else for one thing it's still  in the early stages of development so  it's not perfect it may make mistakes or  misunderstand certain input and like any  technology it raises important ethical  questions about the role of AI in our  lives  thank you so much for making it to the  end the entire script for this video was  written and structured by Chad gbt I had  a smart AI write a video essay about  itself I simply just asked the bot to  write a structured entertaining and at  least five minute long YouTube video  essay about itself and include what  points I wanted and it worked although I  had to throw in jokes and edit the  script here and there every paragraph  Was the entire idea and creation of  chagibiti if I didn't tell you would you  have known overall strategy is an  extremely exciting new development that  has the potential to Forever change in  the way we interact with AI it's still  work on progress but it's definitely  worth keeping an eye on as it continues  to rapidly evolve I'll let the link to  charge a T's website if any of you are  interested in playing with the bot thank  you for watching till the end consider  subscribing see you guys
