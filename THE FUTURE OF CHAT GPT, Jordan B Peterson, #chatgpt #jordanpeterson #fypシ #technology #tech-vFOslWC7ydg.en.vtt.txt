 it's smarter than you but it's not that  smart yet because it's just a Humanities  professor at the moment it doesn't  test its  linguistic knowledge against the real  world that's what a scientist does right  you come up with a theory that's  linguistically predicated and then you  throw it against the world and see if it  sticks and then the world tells you  whether or not you're linguistic  construction is valid but the new AI  systems will be able to extract out  patterns from the world itself from  images and so forth and then be able to  test their linguistic constructions  against the world and so they'll  practice just like scientists and the  most advanced models are going to use  text and image and action as well  because they'll build a mortal Human  Action so hang on to your hats ladies  and gentlemen because one of my friend  Jonathan pajo say Giants are going to  walk the earth once more
