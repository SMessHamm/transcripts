 all right we're live  this is the first live this is the first  few good minutes of uh 2023 for me  feeling good  feeling really you know excited about  this conversation and I know I'm not  alone here but I'm always excited to  talk to Dan Miller who I like  what's that I said we don't do it enough  so yeah I'm glad to be the first here  yeah we're starting a year off right  we're starting with Dana you know I I  don't know if I'm the only one but more  people should call you the Godfather  because you've been around you've been  at the Forefront of all this stuff for  years how many years have you been  working with you know conversational AI  Bots call centers speech technology all  of that stuff okay well I mean when you  throw them all together and look at the  precursors it's longer than I want to  talk about so you know I started Opus  research in 86 and and we were back then  we were looking at what has evolved into  these Technologies but it was  intelligent Network Services and what we  call telemedia Interactive Services  um teletext to your TV and video text to  you know tell you all this stuff but um  yeah let's stop there now a lot let's  just say so  um I didn't like the term botfather when  you proposed it like three years ago  because bot seemed like a derogatory  term and we were thinking oh we want to  talk about virtual agents and virtual  assistants and all that but the world  calls them Bots and I'm I'm used to it  you know back then I was like no they're  talking about spam Bots and right things  so  um so but I do get credit in some ways  for coining the term conversational AI  probably 10 years ago and and you know  the idea of having elements of natural  language understanding  um uh analytics uh being applied to  improve the conversations between people  between and among people and between  people and machines you know so uh  still doing it but just getting better  right yeah absolutely matter of fact uh  you posted this not too long ago and  this this really shows your Bona fides  here uh-oh  this is uh yeah I think this is uh Circa  2016 right  I think it was a little yeah right  around there and yeah it was an oracle  thing where pepper was walking around  and and um  giving me lessons on how to be a robot  robot  okay awesome and by the way Kenny Lauer  give you a shout out yeah hey thanks  again he's the man uh catch Kenny with  uh Paul Greenberg on uh on there make  sure I get get my screen back wait a  minute where am I yeah you're a little  inset oh no there we go there we go so  uh Kenny is Paul Greenberg's co-host on  engage with Kenny and Paul excellent  yeah so definitely gotta check that out  look at that  we had we had pepper in our office back  in 2017. yeah very cool all right so I  want to kind of set the stage for the  conversation and please anybody who's  out there listening we we definitely  want to involve you in this any thoughts  any questions feel free to shoot them  out there oh look at this Ray Gerber  you want to talk about journey  orchestration and there's your guy and  Ray are you in are you still in South  Africa let us know where you are but  thanks for for chiming in here all right  I want to start setting stage with this  really I thought really timely quote  that I saw uh posted  um not too long ago I think the speed of  adoption and the creativity of large  language models in generative AI will be  stunning with both good and bad outcomes  to consider uh do you know who said that  Dan I think I stole my first line here  yeah  and you know that's that's what we're  getting down to is is  um  chap GPT we think of as  um you know and we'll get into it you  know is this the iPhone moment when you  know everybody's walking around with the  computer in their pocket or is it the  browser moment when every you know you  sort of harness the the power of the the  network underline the underlying Network  you know what's going on on the internet  and make it accessible by giving sort of  a graphic user interface to it  um but what's really important is that  within chat GPT is this idea that you  can and and right now it's it's Chad  it's mostly text  um but the GPT you got to remember  stands for generative  pre-trained Transformer  so if you  read it right to left  and you turn Transformer which is you  know really you know quite a technical  description of a Quantum Leap in search  technology that went from keywords to  keyword with Concept informed by concept  doing Transformations on sort of a query  and just call it transformational so  we're talking about a transformational  technology you take the P of pre-trained  and say that's like the biggest oxymoron  there is right now because because we're  depending on machine learning and as  people that are playing around with chat  GPT or learning it's kind of interactive  you you do your you know you you write  in your own language you know you chat  in with what you're asking for and you  give it instructions and it answers back  and then  um you you can refine that and get  different and perhaps better answers but  they are the product of pre-training so  it's kind of old stuff but it's the  product of machine learning so it's  capable of just staying of being  constantly trained and that's sort of  the next challenge is how you make it  relevant how you make it contemporary is  to start with the pre-trained and keep  the training going and then generative  is the threat to all of us creatives  that we can take as offense it it it it  generates you know a response based on  the instructor on the instructions that  are provided  and it's really impressive but  it's it's  not always accurate it's unpredictable  when it may just start making stuff up  um  and um  well I got some examples  but one of the things that stood out to  me when you uh mentioned  the speed of adoption  it's it I think it was it got a million  people signed up in a week and that was  quicker than you know like Tick Tock  when when they first came out so you  think about the speed of which they got  to us and the Wildfire fire  conversations and the valuations that  are being thrown around yes  29 billion dollars for something that  nobody even heard of like six months ago  well and that's kind of inaccurate the  29 billion would be a valuation for open  Ai and as Brett kinsella pointed out  it's a 9 billion dollar jump over what  the valuation was prior to the launch of  chat gbt but it still begs the question  is it going to be worth 9 billion and  um you know the jury's out but it it it  it's a testimony to how the Venture  community that high expectations of the  Venture community  are and that this is a bright spot in  the biggest Downer period for Tech firms  that that there's been you know there's  a there's a talk of layoffs there's  um all sorts of things going on and  here's like oh something you can talk to  and it demonstrates its value right away  although today I went on to just sort of  play around with it and and get some  reminders and it said that it was it  wasn't available it's it's it's over  capacity right now yeah which led me to  say huh I've never had that happen with  Google so  and and let's face it there are a lot  more people using Google than there are  yeah but one of the other things that uh  caught my attention here  you know I I wanted to hear from the  horse's mouth so to speak so I I  literally went in and asked I wanted to  explain it in simple terms and I found  this kind of interesting yeah they  couldn't do it in simple terms or at  least when I asked at that particular  time they couldn't so I just I asked  later just all right I'll drop this  simple  right and you get a lot more maybe and  let's do it like this so people can see  what's going on so you do get you know a  pretty substantial answer natural  language processing people can read all  that stuff but I like the kind of the  use cases that it uh it identified as  some of the better ways to use it  customer service and I'm sure we're  going to talk about that uh lead  generation uh personalized see and these  are all really interesting and mostly in  kind of the business terms they're not  really focusing on what I think a lot of  people are using it for right now is  just asking trivial questions and asking  write my term paper and things like that  right and write code which apparently it  can do all that but the right code it  can win bug code  um just some of the cool things I saw  were you can ask it for terms to train  other NLP things so you could say hey  come up with like you know 400 synonyms  for close my account or something like  that right and  um I mean that's what's kind of  seen as an existential threat to you  know where  um  humans get involved in improving what  um any natural language machine learning  based system can do but I think what's  important to point out with in what you  just flashed there was it said chat GPT  is a tool that that that's what we're  talking about here and then I was  collecting metaphors including my own  which was saying hey it it's it's an  invisible friend it it's it's it has the  potential to be this resource that you  say something that pops in your head and  pose it to this engine or you know this  tool and and get some responses and you  can interact with it and eventually you  know get answers that you want  um and you know uh my friend Dr Searles  noteds that somebody else was calling it  a caddy and and so the the analogy there  is you're the golfer but you have this  companion which is the other the other  you know sort of like a specialized  companion that that uh you know can  carry your clubs can tell you which club  to use you know based on what it knows  about you and and  that kind of relates to you know  personal use cases I mean yeah yes I'm  interested in the use cases it will  indeed uh be a valued Enterprises  because I think that you know the engine  the the business models are going to  feed it uh are are gonna be  within businesses but part of a  business's efforts to be  C to B not B to C so you put the tools  closer to the customer  and you know they're gonna enter  um  what they're looking for and they're  going to have this intermediary that's  chat GPT base and it doesn't have to be  you know there's there's a bunch of  other firms out there there's you.com  there's Jasper there's a there's a  number  um  uh potentially smaller more agile firms  than Microsoft or Google that that you  know can can take advantage of the  Investments that are being made in these  large language models that only the big  guys the hyperscalers can do but it'll  be very interesting  yeah and I'm going to post this up there  uh because I think like  probably most other people that are  using it a lot of people are asking  questions to try to get information back  you know not necessarily product or  service or I see a lot of people talk  about trivia all right so I literally  reviewed this I asked uh you know who  were the the leading thought leaders in  CRM and this is where we're going to  talk about some of the issues I have  right well some of the issues I have  with accuracy here now of course you  know who's going to doubt Paul or  Esteban or any of these folks other than  that guy number two but when I just  first of all I'm wondering how do they  come up with this list you know what are  the criteria what is what's the  information that is being fed to come up  with this list and when I look and I  love the fact that it has Paul and it  puts in there the Godfather's CRM I find  that really cool that you picked up on  it for me this stuff is like not right I  have not written several books on CRM  and it's I haven't written one on the  CRM handbook I've written a lot of stuff  and it's been in some books but I I  didn't do it I didn't do that that was  actually Jill to Shay which is luckily  she's on this list but first of all you  you know how accurate are these things  how much  trust can you put in this stuff that's  coming back and I think that's going to  be one of the the one of the main issues  going forward the accuracy of this stuff  it's great that it feeds back something  and and you know there is a level of of  uh correctness here because you know  Paul Esteban Jill Michael Mose  um James Taylor  besides being a really great singer and  songwriter  these are these are folks that you could  say you could put on a list like that  but I want to I want to go to this other  list I found  uh  uh is it this one oops that's not it I  asked about the people who are like the  leaders in I guess I didn't put this up  there  including the the uh the charge in  conversational Ai and one of the folks  that did come up with was  Richard Saucier and literally today  literally like about an hour before  we're doing this I got an email from  Richard Saucier and they were  introducing you chat  which I I'm I haven't had a chance to  look at this yet but I have a pretty  good suspicion you know it's going to  have a lot of similarities with what's  going on with with gbt chat and with  Jasper and all these others or Jarvis I  can't remember Jasper Jarvis  but yeah well I and well I think it's  more like so there's speculation and  it's grounded and everything that there  that Microsoft's gonna put um gonna  figure out how to integrate uh chat GPT  with Bing and  um you chat is a is primarily search so  there is this demo of of a system you  know that takes very seriously that what  uh a couple of things is  um at our recent conference in New  Orleans I you know I listen to what the  five biggest considerations in in  conversational AI uh in the Enterprise  are going to be and and it and the first  one was that um all Commerce begins with  search and right now if you're  um running a contact center and you're  saying your Omni Channel or opti-channel  or multi-channel or something like that  you're and you're trying to track quote  the customer Journey unquote you realize  that you have to zoom out and that  Journey starts when somebody's thinking  I want to buy a car or something like  that and right now you know they'll go  to Google or Google Maps or you know  some flavor of Google to  um you know put in  you know what are the what are you know  what are the cards I want in my price  range or I'm looking for an electric  vehicle or what have you and it's not  particularly conversational and the  returns are in the Blue Links and all  that sort of stuff and and you chat you  know we come up and say no you know  that's not the model for search you want  and and you know Google's we find them  the sort of stuff you can put into that  search box so that you can put in full  sentences and stuff but but you don't  have this expectation like you have you  know with chat GPT or or you chat that  you know you can take the responses and  say no that one or how about in the New  York metropolitan area and and all that  sort of stuff till you get the answer  you want  and um  uh there's knitting  um  he agreed with me on the botfather thing  absolutely  um but yeah searching is different from  than finding and and I saw it finding  findings this intermediate step and or  findings receiving findings based on  your search criteria and then having  sort of a conversational mechanism to  you know refine it and you know searches  is just search is just one use case  where there's a powerful kind of front  end and you can have outcomes that are  hey you know it found this thing for me  or you can have an outcome that says oh  I started out by saying I want to buy a  you know a Chevy bolt in the Denver area  you know something I tried  and and it and it gets you there and and  and knitting yes the finding was not  immediate but the suggested  um the and the narrative answer because  remember the first generative AIS that  were out there had names like you know  narrative service now I'm losing the  names but they were there were two three  of them which were almost like  um that that uh the game where it would  build you know the ESPN was one of the  big users narrative Arts where it could  look at the box score of a baseball game  and it could write the article based on  that so you had sort of a fixed form you  were getting all the information from  and then you had these Buzz phrases you  know the you know if it was a large lead  it would say you know the Guardians  Wallop the Orioles you know and then  puts the score in and then figures out  who the leading you know who the who  kids and what their record was who had  the you know most RBIs blah blah blah  and and it would write the story  and that was kind of cool yeah  I wanted to address  this statement here from Colin but I  before I let you answer this which is  still finding it hard to demonstrate his  value to his senior leadership so I want  to play this clip uh from an upcoming  episode of Engagement quality Kenny  where yeah well they actually are  talking about GPT with uh the guy who's  heading up AI over at Disney Dr Bill  Klein and I want I want to hear this I  want you to hear this interaction I want  uh I also want to let Colin hear this  interaction between Paul and Bill Klein  on where where the hype and where the  real interest where do where do they  kind of meet and how do you separate the  hype from the reality of what can be  done so check this clip out and then  we'll talk about it on the other side I  always wanted to say that on the other  side of the other sounds that's  happening in the world is that people  have found a way to put so incredibly  much data into those systems which hit  this Tipping Point where those systems  capture enough sophisticated patterns  that they can do incredible things we've  seen those with things like GPT and now  GPT chat from openai that can speak to  you like your old person but not only  can they speak to you they can solve  problems for you you can ask them to  write a piece of code for you so you can  ask them to do your homework for you you  ask them to write a poem for you or a  song or entering kind of a new era of  how that type of Technology faces  Everyday People the hype drives me crazy  about it people are declaring it as the  coming of a new Messiah the problem is  the quality of the actual content is  producing stinks now again it's AI I'm  not looking for Perfection I'm looking  to strip hype out I asked it to write a  poem or a rap song about New York and in  the style of Jay-Z and I did it in the  style of Snoop Dogg and then like four  style in that rap song about New York  they were using words like V and vowel  what kind of rap song is they were going  to come out with being that Nisa to tell  me about forecasting CRM in 2023 the  first answer I got was actually the  right one said look I'm an AI I can't  predict anything hit try again all of a  sudden it started predicting all these  things and it took all these standard  tropes about CRM and they had the word  more in front of them it's just the idea  of AI writing it for whatever reason  made it wonderful but the problem is the  quality of the content itself there's a  group of people who recognize it for  what it is it's not a system that can  think it's not a system that is sentient  it's not a system that is actually  learning from you in the ways that we  think about learning it doesn't have  cognition it so they can't solve  problems on its own what it's really  good at is manipulating language and  what's also really good at is  plagiarizing for the first time we're  able to build AI systems that can  actually Converse in natural language  and now suddenly everybody's got to  access their fingertips to something  that you type in and it responds in a  way that seems very very reasonable in a  way that makes people imagine that it  actually is real AI that really thinks  it's like a big illusion or a really  cool card trick there are ways to  manipulate a tool like that to solve  problems and and it's in those places  that I think there's something really  significant to be done right now  all right now well there's a plug and  you saw Kenny Kenny Lauer in there what  did you think that was a really to me  that was really interesting interaction  because I I could see both sides and I  feel  I think I feel the hype more than I'm  feeling you know some of the things that  will climb but I I can see where we  could get to that what are your thoughts  on that well I mean it still relates to  the fact that it's a tool it's uh it's a  platform it's it starts with a long a  large language model that and and that  um  to Bill's point was  um you can characterize it as  plagiarizing but it is trained on all  the knowledge that is out there  um it is pre-trained uh and and I and  and it's always going to involve humans  because one of the things you know that  the concern that Paul expressed is it's  all crap  well if  there there's a role for intermediaries  in a Enterprise setting to the same way  they use  um uh human intervention for training  the current web Bots or chat Bots or boy  spots out there is that the artificial  intelligence based on its experience and  based on pairings uh you know past  pairings of stuff it gathered with  successful responses will make these  suggestions so where it's coming from is  oh I tried this before and nobody said  anything so it's correct you know Brant  wrote the book on blah blah you know  Brent were there to intervene he would  say no I didn't and I won't suggest that  again but they're you know we're uh this  gets to you know is this is AI going to  replace us and be our machine overlords  or is it creating new roles for people  as you move it into the corporate  setting and the answer is for right now  now and and you know the you know we  talked there's a lot of conversations  going on about why open AI beat Google  to the punch and put this you know open  Pandora's Box and and just put it out  there for everybody to use when you know  Microsoft itself would know with with  um  what I pay or whatever that that if left  on its own  remember it turned racist real quick all  right so so they know that for ethical  reasons for reasons of accuracy You're  Gonna Want human intervention uh in  crafting what the answer is in a  corporate setting and and there's a  couple of other reasons that have to do  with um explainability and um  I forget the other word  uh uh transparency of where did these  answers come from and Bill said oh you  know it's plagiarism and and you know uh  uh the G GPT three the the precursor uh  to vote chat GPT and now gbt4  um sort of proved this in in Spades that  uh there's a lot of con and Dolly the  the the image uh generating cousin of of  chat GPT has raised a lot of us because  because if you say hey render a picture  of me in the style of Van Gogh and it  goes and finds a bunch of stuff and and  does it  um  is is it an a it's not original art but  you know back when  you know who asked Captain BMI is back  in the music world when you started  sampling and somebody had to sit there  and say oh that came from you know you  know Gangsta's Paradise there's an awful  lot like uh Stevie Wonder's you know  Pastime paradise  and and you know figuring out what the  digital rights are going to be for all  this we're just starting to scratch the  surface of that you know who gets paid  for rendering these answers  um it's funny that that this came out of  a question of you know I'm having  trouble demonstrating this uh the value  of this to management but there's  you know there's two or three really  good use cases about a about  accelerating the training of bots that  you may already have in the works and  you know right now the Big Challenge  among some of the Leading Edge firms  um who who are Implement who have  implemented Bots is you know how I did  one for my mobile app I did one for the  web that was a q a bot the mobile app  was uh you know a merchant but how do I  sort of consolidate  um to have a single source of Truth or  answer so that it renders appropriately  regardless of how somebody comes in the  you know initiates that conversation and  um  this is kind of the answer that that  there you know there's a uh  there's a layer above just the sort of  large language model that says oh how do  I make it relevant to my business and so  that's about the industry and the common  things that happen there  um and then there's something about that  is like how do I make sure it's accurate  in the setting of my specific business  which is the micro version of that and  that's where right now you really need  human intervention just to make sure  because  um well Google Google knew this forever  and and I think the chat GPT well the  chat GPT people know it as well because  there's certain things it will not  answer you can't you cannot make it get  as racist as as Tay or did um there's it  just won't it won't go there because  it's been told not to go there the the  pre-trained model says  and and that's that and then then the  other thing is is just uh there's use  cases that make your you know customer  care employees more efficient and faster  to answer and sharing accurate answers  and and all that sort of thing so yeah  no I I I I I want to go back to Andy's  question here uh and I do you I guess is  that y'all he did say y'all do y'all  think the quality of fidelity of the  outputted content will increase  exponentially or  asymptotically wow I'm thinking yeah  yeah  don't do that word every day so no I  love so asymptotes are one of my  favorite uh uh geometric functions it  just means that the the you you get  closer to your point of destination but  destination by having it having the  distance at each point and you never get  there the funny thing is using that word  with y'all you usually don't get that  combination but no I I like the question  and isn't that kind of the hope with the  AI part of the chat GPT is that you know  you get all the the the the the  exponential growth in usage provides uh  hopefully exponential or at least growth  and not just the amount of stuff but  hopefully the more accuracy of the stuff  grows I don't know if it grows as  quickly probably not but you should I  mean it should get better as time goes  on as people use it more as more  interaction where data coming comes into  it right yeah but but it is clarifying  he's saying what he's asking is you know  and sort of interspersed in there that  you know we're at the eighth grade level  right now and and um but but bear in  mind that newspapers are written at a  first grade uh not for a fifth grade  reading level when I was a reporter  that's right for a fifth grader so being  part of the audience right the broader  the audience yeah enabled to read and  comprehend the more papers you could  sell but  is that jive with what we think about  when it comes to AI  Fidelity is an interesting word here  um  um  I don't I don't actually know how to  answer that I think that's that GPT no  right well there I mean so gpt3  um  has demonstrated  that you know by absorbing all of the  world's not machine readable knowledge  or selectively and uh doing it and  training on it  um you can get pretty sophisticated  um now if it's moving if it's moving up  to the point where oh at this point  we're just not gonna get any better  um that's kind of like all these  discussions about how accurate is speech  recognition right now which um you know  we we haven't gotten to this point in  our conversation about you know just  saying hey this is all chat right now  but there's a lot of people poised to  bring in the ASR and TTS elements so  that you can almost instantane you can  do this conversationally speaking and  it's happening already I'm not going to  Discount the work that's being done  there but when when  um we looked at the accuracy of speech  recognition and uh it was just in the  past three years and it happened in the  space of six months that that it went um  you know the faster processes and the um  and and the uh deep neural networking  and stuff that the accuracy jumped to  above human accuracy so that the best  speech recognition engines out there are  not perfect but and but they're not  going to get any better or they will get  marginally better but it's just not that  important you know the difference  between  98 and 98.3 or whatever is is um  is from a practical standpoint in  business it just you're already better  than talking to me you know because I'm  I'm not going to hear what you're saying  some noise is gonna interfere my brain's  gonna be somewhere else and I'm I'm  probably like at 80 when even in a  conversation like this so  um yeah so the accuracy of these things  is is it's like how good is good enough  and it's approaching well it's  approaching good enough but the reason  it isn't good enough is that um this  these other areas where it just makes  you know it's there's math involved and  if it's uncertain about an answer but it  wants to answer and and I'm giving I'm  I'm treating anthropomorphically and I  probably shouldn't but but in these  areas of uncertainty it it's generative  and it'll generate something that that  isn't right and and um and like I said I  think for the time being you want human  intervention to minimize how often uh  that happens so hey in Dragon Naturally  Speaking is still around so it's not  like something you have to remember  so here's uh  here's one of the things that I'm having  an issue with with all this  um it feels like and maybe this goes  back to Newton's eighth grade uh  reporting uh book report stuff it feels  like  the the way these this is being used is  uh give me something quick  that I don't have to do on my own  um and then uh that allows me to you  know I most people oh I'm not I  shouldn't say most it feels like there's  a lot of people wanting to use this to  either  get some stuff out without them having  to do actual work or thought and you  should still be thought and be doing  thought work  alongside of this but it feels like some  of these people are using it as a  replacement not as a compliment  to what they should be doing right and  it feels like that's getting way ahead  like like the plagiarism comment that  that's a pretty good comment because  a lot of school children apparently are  doing just that to the point where you  know schools are saying you can't use  don't load that on your your don't you  don't use that app because it's being  used in a way that  I feel it was probably not intended to  be used yeah but when you give a great  tool to humans  it could be a bad tool because of the  human  do you feel like some of the potential  negatives  May outstrip  what I think are some really good  positives and using services like this  like  yeah I mean they're gonna coexist and  then it's up it's up to people like you  and me and Paul and Ralph here and that  makes a great point about could  companies use this as a reason to lay  people off  no or to not lay people off I mean the  the  I mean so actually I I had this  emotional moment over dinner last night  when I was talking about uh how excited  I get about  the the natural language understanding  in uh customer service settings and my  wife looked at me and said can it fix  southwest's problems Southwest Airline  and and it it was a brilliant question  you know it's sort of like okay I'm  stumped but but if I synthesize what you  were asking you know will the bat you  know every every technology out there  and just remember that Technologies  just means that the the tools we use  foreign  correct and that they're they they're  you they're used for good and bad and  probably an equal amount the bad seems  to get a lot more intention and may have  more money involved in it I don't know  I've never seen a a study about that but  the good isn't driven out by the bad it  it persists when it does things like hey  solve Southwest problem here and and um  you know part of that was a total system  failure that dates back to how they  orchestrated you know how their planes  flew and that they had I listened to a  podcast about it this morning so it's  all very fresh in my mind but you know  they they actually you know they put a  premium on Fast turnaround which meant  that they weren't going to do have been  spoke and when they landed they said  this plane is going to turn around in 10  minutes so the pilots themselves help  clean the plane and stuff like that and  and you know you know humans are a big  part of making humans and processes are  a big part of making what works work and  Technologies they're supposed to come in  and help that and and then when  something like this  um like Chachi PT or artificial  intelligence and coaches on how we do  things there's going to be a bunch of  people that say I can use this to do the  perfect crime and you know you could use  it as a password generator you know  there's a bunch of or or I could  actually use this to make people's lives  better and those are those those do not  drive the other out so it's up to us  I love this comment uh from Michael  Klein uh shout out to Michael Klein  thank you for joining us I saw a comment  recently you're not in jeopardy of  losing your job to AI but you are in  Jeopardy of losing your job to someone  using AI  I that sounds like a winner right there  that sounds like that's the way it  should be uh because you shouldn't you I  keep on thinking AI should not be a one  for one replacement it should be a  compliment uh to to a human how many  other there's going to be certain cases  where yeah if it's very mundane or very  the the FAQ kind of stuff  yeah you can see that happening but  really the winning combination to me is  offloading the mundane and and allowing  you to use what a human has  you know that it doesn't have on the AI  system which is that computing power is  humanity and empathy I mean there's  still a there's still a room for that  right  oh yeah yeah and  exactly what what humans do well I mean  we are a sentient we are emotional we  are empathetic and compassionate  um and and but you can you can build  effective AI systems you know things  that know you know it's as basic as if  somebody mentions suicide in a  conversation that the AI knows not to  like give you a how-to but to refer you  to the I mean that that's the uh me you  know that's just the  cliche like you know but but I mean for  a lot of customer care settings you you  can indeed vein empathy uh with with uh  with a bot and  um I don't know that that's this what  what this uh  what the statement that he just made  about  um you know the risk isn't being  replaced by a machine but but being  replaced by somebody that knows how to  use the machines better  um that's absolutely right and and and  you know this gets down to how good the  education systems have to be have to be  near you know to build a talent pool for  today's companies  um you know it's not it's just like oh  don't just go learn to code you know yes  that's helpful get you know get to know  close to the metal what these machines  are doing but then you know be like five  layers above that and know what the  machine you know what know what the  machines do and what controls they're  giving you so you're better at doing a  job the job that you're called to be and  I and  um  you know that starts with you know  Reinventing what you know trade schools  teach and and all that sort of stuff and  uh yeah we gotta we gotta do that so we  have the kind of this General uh  experiment that openai is doing with  with Chad gbt and  I mean you gotta you give the hats off  to them for putting it out there because  they probably are are probably  overwhelmed with the responsive reaction  but how does it go from that to  really being able to have impact on the  Enterprise on the relationship that  Enterprise has with his customers via  you know not only customer experience  but employee experience right because  and I think it was I think it was Jasper  I saw it on their way I'm so confused it  is Jasper and Jarvis I think it's Jasper  Jasper probably yeah where they said  well that's kind of the way they they  kind of view it is uh chat gbt is kind  of a general kind of thing but for a  Enterprise that really put it into place  you have to have you know the domain  expertise the kind of kind of the  information that is goes beyond the  general discussion the general that are  actually general trivia to really being  able to impact specific you know  customers  Industries customer bases Partnerships  and that is where these other potential  systems kind of come into play so what  do you see as the future for for not  just chat CPT but this kind of tool as  you'd like to put it in the Enterprise  impacting the way customers and  Enterprises interact yeah  um so I I have two types of answers to  that and and one one just gets into hey  open AI started out as an open source  project and stuff gets uploaded to  GitHub and it gets put in the hands of  creative people who take the you know  the basic core software and build  Solutions around it and we're at the  early days of that and that's going to  be creating a you know cottage industry  of its own and and the you know the  precursor there's so many precursors in  in open source but I you know people  forget that that um you know something  like uh  Apache which you know every all these  there's Apaches survey servers out there  that are the engine for everything that  that's in these server Farms that are  doing all this stuff and I know there's  there's new generations of chips and  code and everything to make it go faster  but  um but  uh  chat well GPT 3 Lambda all the stuff  that the hyperscalers are have poured a  lot of money into it's under the  expectation that the large language  models  um are are this rich source of all the  world's knowledge that can go through  these filters that that you know then  you know render properly to in a way  that's use case driven or  um you know business situation you know  so I'm just gonna be personal stuff and  help me lead my life better and that's  going to get very interesting and some  of it is in corporate settings to it to  address specific business problems so so  you think of these as key enabling  technologies that something like the  chat GPT moment which removes a lot of  skepticism I mean it's going to raise a  lot of issues about where where it can  go south where it can go sideways but  but it's in millions of people's hands  and everybody's read about it Millions  have used it and and it's a it's a game  changer  I try to avoid cliches but but it's a it  you know it it's a game changer because  we've been exposed now and you know when  they talk about something going viral  uh this has the opportunity of removing  some of the skepticism that this stuff  is nowhere and it it there's nothing it  can do when you when you have  um high school students  um you know asking it to write their  essay about blah blah blah and they can  say it has to be 400 words and  um you know answer this question and  it's actually okay I mean contrary to  what Paul was saying about it all sucks  it  um  it uh it doesn't use the and now unless  you kind of triggered it to do something  like that and and some of this stuff is  at grade level and and it's not eighth  grade if you know if you're in you can  say I you know I'd like I'm gonna I'd  like a master Master's thesis on you  know the future or you know masters of  thesis on James Joyce's Ulysses and you  know there's so much  prior crap you know it may just be as  crappy and perfect as you know could  fool somebody into it so so and that's  going to create a whole industry around  plagiarism detection it already has and  and um and you know we'll see in  unexpected ways it will create new  business opportunities and in ideal ways  it'll actually uh make uh  you know make get finding things getting  answers performing Commerce uh you know  finding that car in Denver you know  easier and faster and more  conversational so that's my optimistic  look I I appreciate it we won't even  have we don't have time to get into the  what happens when this thing is used  with voice as opposed to chat uh you  know text chat we'll leave that for  another conversation because oh  absolutely and it's not far away so  let's do that let's have a few good  minutes you know give give us three  months or something and yeah we'll visit  the the  spoken aspect I'm assuming that's going  to add some some wrinkles to things when  you're when you're able to use your  voice as opposed to type because a lot  of people don't want to type but a lot  more people will use their voice and  what does that bring to the table  so last last thing uh and I think we're  gonna pull from your buddy Pete Hedrick  here  uh does chat GPT tell him if his Cowboys  are going to win the Super Bowl I'm  going to answer before I'm going to say  uh sorry Pete I agree with Newton you  don't even have to go to chat gbt uh  because that can't fix Jerry Jones so  hahaha  sorry  I I just read something that the Super  Bowl halftime show is going to feature  an ad uh from FanDuel which is live uh  they're gonna ask Gronkowski to kick a  25-yard field goal and you get to bet on  whether whether it makes it or not and  um I'm kind of thinking that you could  ask chat GPT  and  it's on you whether you accept it or not  and I you know same thing when you bet  on the Cowboys on the Super Bowl so okay  good luck could you suit a bot if it  tells you you'll get it and he doesn't  um this is like you know what happens  when you're self-driving car gets in an  accident you know what what what did you  sign in advance  uh all right on that note uh Dan thanks  again yeah we'll do this again this is  great and as didn't said we're kind of  at the eighth grade book report level  yeah you're seeing with this thank God I  think that is a compliment knitting yeah  no I think that's a I think it's a a  true statement this is still early days  yeah so it'll be interesting to see but  he also said that the bot father  definitely suits you so you  um  oh wow how can AI help Gronk now God  we're now we're doing like meta we're  gonna do a commercial for a commercial  for something that happens at the Super  Bowl all right I'm good with that all  right all right Greg thanks for joining  us I agree with Greg this is great I  really enjoyed it I always enjoyed  talking to you so it's great we're going  to do it again  because we yeah we I don't even know did  we do anything last year we saw each  other a couple of times but yeah so  we're gonna die yeah not last year I  don't think we went on this last year  but the year before we we did something  from uh dream Force that's right that's  right so we will definitely be doing  more Dan thanks again and good luck with  the the the  cross-country uh right next year from or  actually next month then from San  Francisco all righty all right take care  and thanks again for everybody checking  us out and I'll see you for a few good  minutes uh next week talk to you later
