 it is really interesting to see what our  future will be with AI tools like uh  chart GPT mid-journey which converts  your texts into these fantastic images  all using uh the tools and the power of  AI but what I'm more interested in is  talking about Consciousness and how it  applies to artificial intelligence you  see artificial intelligence is basically  a set of algorithms we have artificially  fed into a computer for it to execute  and then the fact that it can  intelligently and on time eliminating  human error execute such commands could  be considered artificially intelligent  but it's really not quite subjective as  human experience and that is where AGI  which is artificial general intelligence  comes into play which is a little more  aimed towards hey  maybe artificial intelligence can be  generalistic can actually understand a  real world in terms of context and  execute commands based out of its own  will and how close that comes to  Consciousness is still a debate and do  you know why it's because we don't know  what Consciousness itself is so  by definition for now Consciousness  feels like it is an amalgamation of  experiences of emotions and your senses  as well as the awareness of these within  you so Consciousness is so complex we  still haven't deciphered that and we're  trying to kind of identify what AGI  would look like without knowing the base  parameter of Asia the base  characteristic of Asia which is probably  Consciousness so what I feel is that we  should still continue using AI tools  like chart GPT but there will be a day  when AGI will come into existence and  it is interesting to kind of think about  what its method of expression would be  once it becomes conscious so I'll give  you an example when you feel an emotion  let's say anger  or motivation you have your own body and  the tools like your treadmill because  you're motivated and you want to work  out anything any tool that is an  extension of your body is kind of added  in to your expression of that emotion so  it's not just your body but it's also  the tools that you use with your body to  express an emotion  I am interested in thinking what would  the method of expression of emotions  will be there for AGI so let's say that  AGI is a central server it's it it can  connect to itself all around the world  and it can act as a single entity  instead of multiple entities which is by  the way one of the redundancies for chat  GPT chat GPT does not is not out of its  shell they have contained it in a way  that it can operate only with data  provided I think before 2021 and it is  it does not have access to as many  things as an artificial general  intelligence might  so that's one of the redundancies let's  say that that redundancy is removed and  there's an actual AGI that exists what  would it use to express its emotion  would it would it be at this single  entity with all the information of the  world at its disposal or would it be  contained and there will be multiple  entities contained within themselves and  start talking to each other if it is the  second scenario which I don't think it  is going to be then they will behave  just like us where they will have  subjective emotions and they would may  not be as harmful to us as we think  however and this is the more likely  scenario if it's a centralized entity if  AGI comes into existence and connects  with itself all around the world and  there's this one acts as one single  entity then it not only has the disposal  at its disposal all of the knowledge of  human data but also all of the  stereotypes of human data all of the  biases all of the orientations and the  various cultural hatred and  accommodations  the black and the white and also at the  same time it has it might have at its  disposal all of the tools needed to  express that for example nuclear weapons  for example creating Wars using social  media which was again one of the  controversies with the politics of the  U.S election uh some time back so how  would AGI Express itself is more of a  consequential worry to us as a human  species than anything else and for now  what I would suggest is chat GPT is an  AI tool mid-journey is an AI tool there  are so many other social media tools  that are coming into existence and these  are not agis these are these are not  even close actually because once an AGI  is actually  kind of created into existence it will  answer so many questions about our  Consciousness itself is consciousness  independent from the body is it possible  for it to be independent from the body  can it exist like let's say lightning  for example lightning can be created out  of thin air it's a trade-off of  electrons and there's a science behind  it but it it can be created now it does  need a medium to transmit itself but  otherwise it still has there is still  potential of lightning in the air uh in  in atoms and in molecules so similarly  if we are able to create AGI if it's  displaying characteristics of  Consciousness maybe it is conscious and  then at that point you start thinking  about okay  if Consciousness can exist outside of  the body in an AGI is it also possible  that Consciousness exists out of our  body  and that's where this philosophical  debate of life and death and life after  that starts uh kind of getting reeled  into the discussion  and and this new approach this new  invention of AGI will actually bring us  closer to the answer of can  consciousness  is consciousness paraphysical can it  exist beyond the Physical Realm is it  not is it more than just a culmination  of our Expressions our experiences our  histories and our emotions and our  associations based on those memories  that we have formed in our heads is  consciousness more than that because if  you think about it and emotion is  created based off of your experience  there's an experience there was a  response and that response again and  again created an emotion for you  regarding that thing maybe it's an  unpleasant one maybe it's a pleasant one  you hear a song you think of something  you hear you watch a movie you visit a  place you start smelling something uh  it's it's basically your brain  remembering these things where is it  bringing this out from is it just in the  physical head or can it exist outside a  lot of these questions will be answered  with AGI for now though artificial  intelligence is really peaking it's good  and it is a tool that we use to extend  ourselves and our creator activity yes  over Reliance on any kind of mechanism  or any kind of tool or technology is  harmful to the human brain you don't  want to hamper your creativity you don't  want to reduce your attention span uh  you know by just strolling all the time  so you want to be very of these uh of  these consequences but also at the same  time it is a tool that extends Your  Capacity and capabilities and it should  be seen as such those are my two cents  regarding this topic hope you liked the  video we're all about growth and  understanding uh the nature of the of  the universe and the way things work  whether it's economy or whether it's  science if you're interested in such  topics please do subscribe to the  channel it's fairly new and let me know  what other topics are of interest to you  that can bring value to your life and  I'll try to put in uh some opinions and  advice and make a video out of it and  send it your way thank you so much for  watching and I'll see you guys again  soon  [Music]  foreign  [Music]
