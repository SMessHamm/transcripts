 the AI search engine was a heating up  Google recently announced it's Bing chat  GPT competitor Bard but users don't have  access to it just yet meanwhile if  you're looking to try out the new Bing  yourself you'll have to join a wait list  until then Yahoo finances Ali Goldfinger  is here to give us a first look Bing  didn't think I'd be using that in 2023  I didn't either Rochelle so here's the  deal Microsoft's Bing chat GPT crossover  is officially rolling out and I wanted  to show you what it looks like because  in some ways at least it looks a lot  like the search experience we're all  familiar with so here's what the Bing  integration looks like on a desktop for  example now I'm going to be real with  you that's a lot of text for me but now  on comparison let's look at it on mobile  which is a completely different  experience personally as a consumer I  liked this one a bet this one quite a  bit better now notably the new Bing  isn't available to everyone yet and  there is as you said a wait list  um candidly this is still really nascent  and to that end Google unveiled a slew  of AI Innovations today for its search  lens and maps apps however you said it  Rochelle the competitor the chat GPT  competitor Bard is still only being  tested by a small pool of users now  looking at this and this is my opinion I  think it's possible we could be looking  at a situation where Microsoft is the  first mover but I don't know if I feel  like like Microsoft or Google has gotten  the user interface or scaling right just  yet  I mean Google is so far ahead in terms  of front of mind for consumers as well  so how competitive Can Microsoft really  be here with Bing it's a fantastic  question Rachelle because you know Les  I'm going to give you actually some  numbers to really set up the uphill  battle that Microsoft is playing right  is in right here so being a search  market share is only about nine percent  as a compared to more than 80 percent  from Google so if search really is the  prize here Microsoft still has an  incredibly long way to go that said this  is the first time in a long time I can  remember being making headlines so the  search landscape could really be set up  for a shakeup however there's also  another question from Google which is  that how far can Google really push this  without coming under antitrust scrutiny  now given how aggressive the FTC has  been in cases against big Tech recently  you have to imagine that's also really a  concern here so there might be a little  bit of a gap to let some light in for  Microsoft but the race is on and it's  still early  we'll have to see what that means for ad  spin I know there was some concern about  potentially Google cannibalizing itself  if it does end up coming into this foray  so we'll be keeping an eye on that as  well Yahoo finance is Ali garfinkel  thank you so much  nothing's free in this world and that  includes Microsoft's integration of chat  GPT functionality into Bing's search  engine Morgan Stanley Alice Keith Weiss  estimates near-term integration costs of  600 million dollars to one billion  dollars annually for Microsoft silicon  Valley's Tech Giants are poised for a  fight over AI superiority here's what  you need to know  the emergence of chat GPT has led to an  arms race in the tech sector as  Microsoft and Google scramble to  integrate generative artificial  intelligence into their search platforms  Microsoft revealing it will begin using  open ai's chat GPT and some of its  products including its Bing search  engine as the company looks to  capitalize on chat gpg's popularity to  take market share away from Google it is  definitely a new day for search the  opportunity to bring and Infused Ai and  new chat like experiences with the tools  that people use the most on the web  today which is the search engine in the  browser is an opportunity to do  something completely new just this week  Google releasing its own AI chatbot to  compete with the Microsoft backed chat  GPT Google CEO Sundar pashai introducing  the newest entry in the AI Revolution  it's called Bard and like chat gbt Bard  is a generative AI with a conversational  interface meaning it can create  conversations on its own and provide  simple explanations for complex problems  pashai says Barb will be open to the  public in the coming weeks and of course  China's Tech sector can't let American  companies have all the fun Hong  kong-based Baidu also getting in on the  action announcing plans to release its  AI chat bot called Ernie in the coming  months all of these companies are still  in very early stages of AI development  and are looking at integrating this  technology across their platforms and  into our lives from search to Cloud to  gaming and Beyond  thank you  let's get to today's morning brief  written by Miles odlin Amazon disease  it's what Steve Eisman who made his name  during the financial crisis calls the  investor urged to chase what they see is  the next big thing today the big thing  is AI miles joins us here on set now all  right so Miles take us into this uh and  the thesis behind what's driving some of  the fomo right now and where AI plays  into that perhaps yeah I mean look um  Amazon disease isn't exactly like a  novel thing I mean analysts have been  saying oh what's the biggest Tam so  total available Market addressable  Market however you want to say it and  you just go for that so you get a small  percentage of a big market and then you  have a big company my point here is just  that when we look at what's happening  with AI stocks there can be a lot of  like what's the deal why is this  happening at all and I think that  eisman's comments are pretty much like  this is why it's happening this is why  anything happens go back in time look at  rivien a couple years ago there's a lot  of cars sold what if they got one  percent of them there you go you buy the  stock I mean it's not really rocket  science and you know there's like a sell  side diss in here with heisman's  comments as well which we can leave to  the side but I think it's again just  kind of a very simple way for investors  who are confused about why things become  hyped to figure out why they are hyped  well I also love the tweets that always  like whether it's Amazon or any other  giant company right now the tweets they  say if you bought Amazon in whatever  year was you would be a  multi-trillionaire right now I think you  know that sort of feeds into this uh  myth if you will of these kinds of  companies I mean look I think you can  look at the entire batch of post  honestly post Facebook  venture-backed tech companies and look  at how they perform in public markets  and I think you could say every one of  them is a disappointment relative to the  alleged Tam the alleged Amazon like  opportunity that stood in front of all  of them I mean sure Airbnb is a big  company I think it's what 80 billion  market cap doordash is fine um you know  peloton's done okay Lyft Uber Etc I  think relative to expectations they're  all disappointment given what we would  have said and what we were saying in  2017 2018. well you've been doing this  for about a hot minute here what ends  this activity is there just something  people should be looking out for I don't  think anything ends it I think this is  just like the framework I mean the point  of a columnist is you take two different  things and you say here these two things  mean this one thing so when there are  these manias basically this generation  of investors is going for this idea when  you say I don't understand why everyone  is buying X I think you can pretty much  back into well they think there's an  Amazon like opportunity they think  there's a really big market and if these  groups of companies get one percent two  percent three percent of that market  then there's something there carvana  right is another it's not like you can  go through the list of every hot stock  for the last 10 years and basically this  is the answer and I don't think they're  teaching anything different I mean every  every tech company is out populated by  mbas so I don't think they're teaching  anything different in business school  either so this is pretty much what it's  going to be probably for the balance of  our careers actually we'll be old and  they'll change it and then we'll be like  I don't get it but I just think look  it's a useful don't worry about it at  that point hopefully we'll be set for  retirement retirement you've seen the  stock market  I'll start my career last year so we  should well actually if I had started  last year and anyway regardless stocks  go up over time but that's another  conversation I mean if we're gonna live  forever too we could talk about the  metformin and you know the Biden thing  like this is hot in your household yes  it is very hot for another time trying  to live forever we will talk about that  another time but I'll say thank you  [Music]  Baidu shares jumping today up over 11  after announcing today its own chat  gpt-like project called erniebot could  there be a dark horse in the race I  think there absolutely could so buy to  what's important to say has positioned  itself as the AI leader in China's Tech  sector so it's of course they want a  piece of this pie and  Ernie is a couple months from coming out  but I think there are a lot of really  high hopes as that stock Spike really  showed I also think you can't fully  count out meta yet they've been pretty  circumsticked about it but just last  week Mark Zuckerberg was saying he  really believes in generative AI he's  really excited about and it's something  that is clearly going to be important  down the line so I think it's I think  there are a couple Dark Horses there may  even be some that we don't know about  yet the other thing I do want to say I  love that this got you guys both so  fired up who do you think that's what I  want to know  if I had to guess I would say Google  there we go I know I know but Dave is  clearly reading my articles though which  is I which I love  um in the end I do want to say this is  clearly a hype cycle we don't know how  this is all gonna shake out but it's  clear something is happening that's  really exciting because clearly we're  all excited about it we are changing the  way we live and work Ali garfinkel thank  you so much  [Music]  Tech Giants Google and Microsoft are  going head-to-head over the future of AI  Microsoft announcing earlier this  afternoon the integration of chat GPT  into its search engine and then Google's  scheduled to hold an event on chat and  AI their own plans tomorrow so who's  going to come out on top Yahoo finance  Tech reporter Ali garfinkel joining us  Ali what did you think of the  announcement that we've gotten from  Microsoft today you know I actually want  to play a little bit of a game with you  guys Shauna I like games do you like  games okay so I'm gonna lay out the pros  and cons of who's going to win here  Microsoft or Google and you guys are  going to choose your fighter does that  sound good got it good so on Google's  hand right before we get to Microsoft  it's important to say that Google has  already announced its chat gbt  competitor it's called Bard and it's  important that if search is the goal  here Google is still absolutely the  dominant leader in search Google has a  search linguistic Advantage we don't say  we're searching for something we say  we're Googling something however Google  has already seen us behind on this I had  a source text me this morning saying  Bard screams we rushed and I think  there's a lot of pressure on Bard to be  excellent and if it doesn't surpass chat  gbt or is at least not as good it's  gonna look pretty rough on them so  that's the Google that's the case for  and against Google Now the case for  Microsoft Microsoft is absolutely seen  as having a head start here because of  their long-standing investment in open  Ai and the fact that they've now already  announced this Bing integration I also  think that Chachi BT right now has a  linguistic advantage in generative AI  right we're saying chat gbt not  generative AI right I also think that  the world of applications that Microsoft  can plug to actually PT into are pretty  obvious you have the 365. you have Azure  and while Google has that it's not as  well set up of an ecosystem now the cons  right if search is the goal Bing only  has nine percent of the search market  right now so which puts Microsoft way  behind and it's also not really clear  how much Microsoft's Head Start will  matter okay so those are the two cases  who do you believe in I get to go first  you go first go ahead well no question  about it for me this is Microsoft  because of chat GPT because of first  mover Advantage think of Tesla why don't  we okay a market cap north of 600  billion dollars were GM and Ford between  53 and 57 billion they got to a hundred  million users in just a few months  that's faster than Instagram faster than  even Tick Tock they are already changing  the way we live and work real estate  agents are already using chat GPT to  rewrite their property listings to write  legal documents it is way ahead of the  game here this isn't about a couple of  months it is what Ali said several years  of Advantage they made that commitment  early and often with billions of dollars  and saty Nadella said earlier today it's  the most exciting thing he's seen since  it became the Microsoft CEO your only  Advantage is it's a verb Google and that  is a massive Advantage when you take a  look at the fact that the numbers that  Ali put up there that uh that big only  Google has more than eighty percent so  that there gives Google a huge Advantage  yes I would agree with you in terms of  the timeline of this Google is coming  out a little bit behind their huge  competitor out there chat GPT and  Microsoft but you can't count Google out  given the past success in the memo  yesterday from CEO Sundar pachai he was  saying that Google you got to take a  step back and think about the wins that  Google has already had and you went out  to say that a lot of the technology that  is being used in chat GPT that's being  used in other AI Services was invented  at Google they have a track record they  have a history of coming out on top  they've been investing in AI now for  quite some time they're late to the chat  part of it but I think they're going to  be the winner our friend Laura Mart  would point to you that her note  suggests Google has an innovator problem  and have had it for quite some time  all right we're announcing today some  Microsoft movers uh a major move from  Microsoft announcing it will incorporate  chat GPT into their Bing search also CEO  saty Nadella saying at company  headquarters it's a new paradigm for  search joining us now with more head of  Microsoft devices search at Yusuf Medi  and Tech editor Dan Howley nice to see  you both Yousef thanks so much for being  here why is it in the words of saty  Nadella and you Paradigm for search  uh it is definitely a new day for search  the opportunity to bring and Infuse Ai  and new chat like experiences with the  tools that people use the most on the  web today which is the search engine in  the browser is an opportunity to do  something completely new and today what  we've seen is of the 10 billion queries  that happen every day roughly half go  unanswered you do basically you can't  get an answer to the question you try it  we now now have a system with the new  Bing and the new Edge to actually answer  your questions to let you chat with it  and let it create and Spark your  creativity by generating content  yeah Joseph I want to ask how this kind  of differentiates you from the other  players in the space the the Googles  primarily but also uh obviously Yahoo  one of the components of uh our parent  company uh any of the others that are  out there how does this kind of help  differentiate Microsoft  yeah so there's a there's a couple of  different things we've done first is  through our partnership with openai we  have today announced a new large  language model that is even much more  powerful than chat GPT and it's tuned  for search the second thing is we've  built an integrated experience across  you know the web search the browser and  chat it's all in one it's super easy to  use you can talk to it with your natural  language natural voice and it's now  intelligent so it can assess the page it  can give you things like summaries it  can do things today that you really  can't do with any other service  what do you see just in terms of the  first mover Advantage obviously you are  right now a leader in this space what  kind of Competitive Edge do you see that  giving Microsoft  yeah being first to Market is a huge  Advantage because the way that you  succeed here is you test you learn you  get feedback and you improve and being  out here being first in the market we're  excited to get that feedback to grow  we're gonna we're really gonna try and  innovate we're going to try and push the  envelope on coming up with new  experiences that can wow people in their  daily life and we're excited to get all  that learning  you know yourself I've been uh trying it  out um I asked it to help me plan a trip  to Japan and I gave it very specific uh  guidelines I said you know I've already  been to Tokyo I've already been to Kyoto  uh give me some examples of of where  else I should visit and what I can do  and it did a great job of lining that up  you know obviously it's something that's  uh as I was pointed out is limited at  this point as far as availability so I  guess for the general public uh when can  we expect to see more people be able to  get their hands on this and really put  us through its paces  yeah we're we're so excited to get out  there I'm glad that you getting a chance  to play with it because I do think it's  an incredible experience our plan is to  do the following today anyone can come  to bing.com and try like 20 queries just  to see the magic happening and the sign  up for the wait list uh our waitlist is  already filling up pretty fast and then  our plan is to scale that out to  millions of people in the coming weeks  so that's roughly how we're thinking  about the timing and then we'll have a  mobile version that will also be coming  very soon Bing has about nine percent of  the global market share and search how  do you presume chat Chief PT can change  that dynamic  yeah the new the new Bing which includes  these chat like experiences and the new  Edge I I feel the the first step for us  as as I sort of said earlier we have to  wow people we have to just do an  incredible job answering questions and  and we're doing that as as we've been  getting out into the marketplace if that  happens more people will come and try to  use Bing and use Edge and then they  might use it more and then that will get  then advertisers are more interested and  the whole business kind of goes from  there but our first job is just to  Delight people  I guess you know when it comes to  Microsoft overall obviously there's the  the multi-year multi-billion dollar  agreement uh or investment rather with  open AI I guess you know this is this  the first step of many uh where we'll  see that kind of Technology rolling out  into Microsoft's various offerings  um do you and and is there a particular  reason why search and uh went first  yeah it's a great question first off  you're correct Our intention is to bring  the power of AI to all of the products  we do at Microsoft we've already started  a lot with Azure you can expect that  we're going to bring that and improve  all of our products we start with search  because it is the largest category in  the software area the online advertising  Market of which search is a part of is  600 billion in terms of total adjustable  market so it's a big opportunity and the  applications that drive that obviously  the browser the search engine they're  the most used applications on the PC so  we start with the most important area we  also start because honestly we feel that  there has not been enough innovation in  that space we think there's an  opportunity to dress as I said earlier  the half of questions that just don't  get answered so we're starting there  we've got some great ideas and we think  the the new services that when you get a  chance to play with it you'll see just  how much better it is than today's  search  I guess just as a final question you  know we look at search engines we look  at the internet  um you know and there's there's  obviously issues that need to be  addressed as far as caution uh you know  people may be searching for nefarious  things online uh how do you ensure  safety in something like this I know  that obviously uh openai chat GPT there  were discussions about that that had  some guidelines uh or uh guardrails put  in rather how do you ensure the kind of  safety when it comes to something so  large as online search  yeah so we do we we've taken our  approach to safety and responsibility  with AI uh incredibly seriously in fact  we start there before we even start on  what we're going to build we start  learning how we're going to build it  we've done a number of things we have ai  principles that we've published out uh  we've had met technology work early on  as it lands in the park you get to use  today we do a number of things to really  put safeguards in place and guard rails  so we can understand when people enter  questions that might be bad like hate  speech or violence or self-harm we can  catch those queries and we don't answer  them we make sure that when we train the  model that the model knows not to take  cues on that and then before the answer  is considered we check them again so we  do our we do a lot there to make sure  and guarantee that we can have a safe  experience for people  all right you said many head of  Microsoft devices in search thanks so  much and of course our thanks to Dan  Howley as well  open ai's chat GPT is already making its  way into different areas of the job  market Yahoo finds Tech reporter Ellie  garfinkel joins us how now to break down  how and where it's being used by  businesses Ally  hi Brian so a lot of the reasons and  ways we've seen chat gbt go viral have  been creative or off kilter in some way  things like write a love sonnet to my  rice cooker or tweets that could have  been written by Elon Musk but I think  it's also really worth looking at the  ways chat GPT is being used today  already in businesses I want to pull out  three we found more we found five and  more but I think these are there are a  couple that are I think really  worthwhile the first is Healthcare right  now this is a scary thought originally  but the applications of this we're  primarily seeing right now are  predictable and preventable sicknesses  we're talking colds flus eczema things  that your mom has the answers to  um importantly AI chat Bots are already  being used in healthcare so we can think  of chat GPT for now and Healthcare is  sort of an enhancement to those the next  one real estate this is one we've talked  about a lot already agents are  essentially using it to describe home  listings it's actually I wanted to pull  this one out because it's a perfect  example of something chat gbt is really  good at it's a formulaic writing task  it's exactly the kind of thing that chat  gbt is not only structured to do well is  structured to do fast and that kind of  brings us to the last thing which is  customer service which has some overlaps  with PR marketing these are tasks where  efficiency is important and where there  is a lot of repetition it's incredibly  formulaic for instance if you're writing  FAQs or if you have common problems how  to solve them now it's important to say  for any of these chat GPT is not  necessarily reliable nobody is talking  about it as a replacement to humans on  the record yet and it should also say  that these answers can be stiff or they  can be confidently inaccurate um I  wanted to come up with some examples for  you and this is the punch line but chat  GPT was too busy to take my call this  morning so unfortunately I don't have  examples for you I was disappointed I  thought we really had something  um but the they left me with a lovely  poem so I believe that will be up on the  screen at some point soon okay all right  so as we're waiting for this poem I just  got to know because we're also waiting  for this to be monetized by a lot of  these companies too I mean what that  real real Runway looks like for them to  be able to not just introduce these  skills to the public or this generative  AI to the public but how they make money  off of it it's a it's a really good  question Brad because I think the  reality is we don't really know and I  think it's going to vary across  Industries for instance also there's the  time as money argument in the case of  the efficiency that something like this  would require I think that's hugely  appealing but I think in the case of  Healthcare in the case of Real Estate  there's so much we still don't know and  that's that's sort of where the  nervousness I think comes in for a lot  of workers for example all right Finance  his own Ali Garfunkel joining us here on  set thanks so much Ali we appreciate it  I I actually I think the most underrated  number that we got this week was UBS  revealing a hundred million users on  chat GPT in two months now for context  Facebook renamed them self meta what  almost two years ago and we still have  no idea what it is we still have no  practical use for it is we have no way  to show that it's transformed our lives  and in two months chat GPT is  transforming the way we live when we  work real estate agents are using it if  you don't believe me that's cool believe  Tim Cook he says quote it's a major  focus of ours it's incredible how it can  enrich our lives adding this gen it is  impacting virtually everything we do so  don't believe me but believe Tim Cook  yeah certainly I mean you can't argue  with cert there's a lot of hype around  it Jared you were just looking at  individual stocks even on an ETF coming  out that's capitalizing on this media  that we certainly are seeing are around  chat GPT we don't have a lot of  information around it but the ticker  will be chat CH a t will be focused in a  number of areas but one specifically the  conversational aspect of AI and of  course that means Chad GPT so there is  as meaning around it I would likely see  that you would think when you take a  look at some of the other trends like  metaverse in the past a number of ETFs  were launched over the last year and a  half that are based on metaverse so I  think AI Chachi BT might be onto  something here we could be seeing a  number of new ETFs over the next year  chat four about to be released in a few  weeks and it's supposed to hook up with  Microsoft and Bing so uh the enhanced  version even coming out uh pretty  quickly here GPT plus that charges 20  bucks a month and Promises faster data  and actually the ability to get on which  is difficult right now 4 pm I have a  difficult time I have really struggled  to get access to it it's been very busy  [Music]  all right well chat GPT is among the  fastest growing consumer apps in  Internet history and with nearly 60  million monthly active users in December  it's showing no signs of slowing down  well our team spoke to Kathy Wood Arc  invest founder and CEO about the latest  Trend take a listen to what she had to  say  what I would be looking for a little bit  more and it is how are our companies  harnessing AI for their own businesses  do they have these proprietary data sets  so that's the first thing because this  is going to AI is going to enable the  most massive productivity increase in  our history  we're joining us now to break down the  open AI computer program is Yahoo  finances Ali garfinkel we know that  Kathy likes to do a Long play she's  usually ahead of the game on some of  these things still waiting for them to  pay off but what about chat GPT so  Rochelle chat GPT is on Pace to pass a  hundred million active monthly users  after just two months since its launch  this data is from UBS and I want to put  in some context the company that chap  this puts chat GPT in so you know here  you have the months to reach 100 million  Global active monthly users right you  have Instagram at 30 months Pinterest at  41. you have Tick Tock at an incredible  nine and you have chat GPT at two now  for contacts you think about Google  translate Spotify Uber we think of these  as spectacularly successful apps Tech  problems aside and that is an incredibly  important part of this the other key  fact here Rochelle the total addressable  market for generative AI could be over  one trillion dollars and chat GPT is  currently averaging 13 million million  unique visitors per day which is more  than double what we saw in December so  some of this data frankly is pretty  jaw-dropping we're seeing applications  all over the place  I mean when you consider just how  recently we even found out about this  company only a few years and being just  two months away from hitting that level  I mean it really is mind-boggling now is  there that any company looking to  compete with chat GPT there certainly  are a lot of would-be competitors of  course the most famous case of this is  Google Google chatgpt has been called a  Google killer I personally think that  while talking about Chachi EBT as a  Google killer is a little overblown it  doesn't change the fact that Google is  going to be asked about chat gbt and its  plans with generative AI today in its  earnings call at the same time from  China you also have Baidu which is  positioning itself as China's top AI  developer so they're reportedly getting  in the game and Baidu stock has popped  on the news lastly even yesterday in  Meadows earnings call Mark Zuckerberg  spoke positively about generative AI  saying that he's very optimistic about  it and doesn't want to get ahead of the  game but that it's something he's  watching so Rochelle there are would-be  competitors all around but we'll see who  kind of comes to the fore as the real  competitor to chatgpt  I mean this this race really is heating  up fantastic stuff they're alligafink  all there for us  [Music]  a GPT has exploded since its late  November debut uh its capacity complete  tasks like coding writing content and  entertaining users it has investors  trading the hype and it's sending both  leading and under the radar artificial  intelligence stocks higher Arena's foray  is joining us now to talk a little bit  about that rally and then we're going to  circle back with Kathy in just a moment  you know what have you been seeing yeah  Julia and we have been seeing AI related  stocks really Skyrocket over the last  month I want to show you on our Wi-Fi  interactive board you will see here  first I want to show you c3.ai this  company went public back in December  2020 it's an AI software company it's  clients include the US Air Force 3M  shell Bank of America take a look year  to date up 92 percent now this stock had  been cut up in the tech selling last  year but this year really rallying  around this Buzz around AI of course on  this chart you'll also see a Microsoft  which has invested 10 billion in open AI  the maker of chat gpp you also see  BuzzFeed which last week was up 310  percent last week after announcing that  it would be using AI tools to create  content and then you have some other  smaller cap companies like big bear.ai  this offers products for healthcare  government and Manufacturing string and  year to date this stock is up  significantly up 405 percent you also  have this other company called  SoundHound it's a voice AI software  company small company but nevertheless  here today A 14 also getting caught up  in the AI excitement and there are many  uses of AI uh there's an analyst over at  cfra research that talks about cyber  security and how AI is used with cyber  security firms so she was pointing out  to crowdstrike Palo Alto Network that  year to date these stocks are up as well  and then we also have to point out that  AI has been mentioned during earnings  call I mean meta talked about using AI  tools to help Engineers to be more  productive volunteer back in November  talked about Forester naming palantir as  a leader in artificial intelligence and  machine learning and IBM's arvind  Krishna recently said that AI is  projected to contribute 16 trillion to  the global economy by 2030 on also  saying we have been co-creating with  many clients to deploy AI at scale guys  and as really nice work really  interesting overview of what we've been  seeing in the public markets some of our  agents are using this technology to  follow up with customers not all the  people who go into real estate are  William Shakespeare and so they struggle  with just composing an email that's  grammatically correct and if you give  chat GPT just a few facts about what's  going on with this customer you get a  nice email on the other side so I think  chat GPT is going to change online  marketing just generally  more people are going to use it to  create content when they're not good  writers themselves they're just like my  fifth grader who's trying to figure out  how to get a term paper done  [Music]  all right I need some help selling your  quaint Charming or even stunning home  turn to my new favorite assistant chat  GPT residential and Commercial agents  telling CNN that AI has transformed  their job in a very short period of time  consider chat gpd's been around a few  months they're using chat to write  listings social media posts even  drafting legal documents for now chat  GPT is free for users but reports  suggest open AI is considering a monthly  charge of 42 bucks One agent telling CNN  he'd pay a hundred to two hundred  dollars a month to continue using that  tool now that's an interesting question  moving forward much like Elon Musk is  considering at Twitter how do you  monetize those people who will pay 200  to the same people that are paid two  dollars like I would how do you set a  price that's somewhere in the middle but  very fascinating Trend that agents I  spoke to half a dozen this morning all  of them said oh yeah when I asked them  if you're if they're using wow that's  adoption when you think about the fact  that we only started I thought they'd  all say no way I don't even know what it  is exactly or they'd be a little bit  hesitant just in terms of how much they  can rely on it but it is very easy to  use I will say after you enter a few  things or you try to do it a couple  times you do pick up on the keywords  that you need to enter what exactly the  direction you need to give it but this  all goes back to the jobs that chat gbt  could potentially replace now in real  estate agents side of it they're not  replacing their jobs it's actually  helping those jobs but I think it gets  to the point that some of those jobs  that are replaced or maybe potentially  could be replaced are those mundane  tasks that a computer could simply do  there has been studies out there saying  that it could potentially AI in general  could potentially replace up to 70  percent of the work that gets done in  front of the computer screen so that  really just talks about how powerful  this technology is and I love it in this  case because it's not replacing those  jobs it's helping them better do their  jobs and saving time for elsewhere and  what else that they could be doing just  in terms of maximizing their listings  and that's what chat GPT told me last  week when I asked it if it's going to  replace jobs it said no essentially  we're here to supplement the jobs and  make you help you do them better not  buying it entirely yeah when you look at  this I I know a number of agents who  haven't has assistants that do similar  jobs to what these agents are telling me  Chad GPT is doing it is not going to  take away an agent's job but those  descriptions will take away potentially  thousands of real estate assistance  those are the menial tasks that you  don't want to do when you have ai that's  currently free no question about it it's  going to take away thousands of jobs as  we move it was interesting the  monetization aspect of it too you're  saying that the agents would pay what up  to 200 a month just to use this really  shows how valuable this technology it  can't be free much longer these reports  are certainly reliable I don't know if  40 bucks is a little high I certainly  would not pay that I think somewhere  around five bucks with the average user  but when you've got people that'll pay  50 bucks that's the question for them  much like it is for Elon  is chat GPT a jobs killer well who  better to ask than chat GPT itself the  AI told me quote it can potentially  replace jobs that involve generating  written content such as writing news  articles product descriptions or social  media posts it could also potentially  assist with tasks such as customer  service and Technical Support however it  is important to note that chat GPT is  not intended to replace human workers  but rather to assist them and improve  efficiency if however you prefer a human  answer to that question here's one of  the smartest humans we know MIT  professor and author synonym who told us  it's one of the greatest upheavals in  labor market we've seen in a long time  adding this  it will displace jobs it will create  what's known to economists as skill  biased technical change technical change  that favors some skills and complements  some skills and substitutes for or  competes with other skills and every  time in human history that we have  experienced something like this we've  had to reskill and change our focus on  what humans did and what machines did in  order to create complementarities and  increase welfare across the board  so if I'm in college kids I'm rethinking  what my potential major might be based  on what jobs might exist 10 years from  now because  rest assured chat gbt is coming for your  job even if it does not intend to your  bosses will wonder can I replace each of  these people with artificial  intelligence you saw what happened to  the BuzzFeed stock oh I saw it it's  inevitable it is inevitable it's a  little bit scary when we start to think  about all of this and of course just  what exactly jobs it is going to replace  in terms of the degree of that the CEO  of automation anywhere he was at Davos  weighing in on this and of course he is  involved in AI so maybe a bit biased  here but he was saying it could replace  up to 70 percent of all the work we do  in front of a computer saying that up to  70 percent of that could be automated  that really puts it in perspective just  in terms of how many jobs could be at  risk and like Dave what you're saying  kids need to be thinking about kids that  are in college kids that are in high  school you have to have this in the back  of your mind just in terms of what that  space is going to look like 10 15 years  from now because according to some  estimates 30 percent of us professionals  are already using AI on a daily basis  within their work so it's starting to  tick up there just the popularity of it  now we've got chat GPT in it yes I'm not  so concerned about chat GPT as I are its  descendants that is son of Chachi BT  daughter of jet whatever because uh if  this is not going to be limited to the  realm of just typing and being in front  of your computer these uh this is going  to be uploaded to lifelike robots I  think everybody is going to have a  domestic or most people are going to  have a domestic servant in 10 15 years a  robot that does a lot of chores I think  we're going to come to realize that  we're not that intelligent we're not  that special and we're really all here  just to uh anybody die or picture it's a  Friday afternoon this is a this is  enough no this is uplifting we're here  to entertain ourselves all right and  chat GPT is going to help all right all  this serious work we're doing a lot 90  of this just gonna be automated you know  people looked at the 1950s they saw  automobiles uh and all these uh Robots  coming into their facilities this isn't  going to eliminate jobs it's going to  create new ones people are going to have  more Leisure Time talk about the five  day the four day the three day the two  day work week guess what this is  everybody come on pick up your Ubi at  the local at the local facility on  National have fun at workday Jared just  killed off 70 of workers in the U.S  economy  90 of our daily tests now look we talked  earlier in the program about how many  professions are having massive shortages  across the country and the real problem  is none of them are the five professions  that we put up on the screen that  experts do think will see the most  impact and those are education finance  software engineering journalism and  graphic design those are not the fields  that we're suffering from massive  shortages in can they fly planes can  they be nurses can they drive trucks  that's where we need them can they be  accountants though that I think might be  a potential solution feel better about  an accountant than a nurse Enron style  accountant yeah you're gonna have to go  to a human check GPT not wired to do  that kind of stuff  [Music]  well sticking with chat gbt talking  about experience experimenting with it  figuring out how it works we are going  to take a closer look at this and then  also about the information it spits out  we want to bring in Tech reporter Ali  garfinkel and Ali you did just this you  had a conversation with chat GPT you  interviewed chat GPT what was it like  I did Shauna you know as as this has  been going viral people have been  fascinated obsessed scared I have been  all three of those things so I decided  to ask it why  um I should say others have done  interviews with chat GPT but I had some  questions of my own it got pretty  existential but I wanted to just draw  out three things that were really  striking through the process the first  number one is actually pretty simple cat  gbt can't be on or off the record this  actually caught me a little bit by  surprise I was like well technically I'm  defying my programming can I publish  this if it's not on the record the  conclusion I came to as you can tell is  yes but it certainly presents other  problems like for instance I think what  I was expecting was that it would say I  am always on the record I am a machine  learning model though as it turns out it  can be neither the second thing that was  really striking was that  to get good answers you need to learn to  talk to Jack gbt we can't just talk to  chat gbt and say hey why are we  fascinated by you or hey what do you  think of this  um it's not going to give you  personality it's not going to tell you  what it thinks unless you give it a  little bit more color or unless you tell  it what personality to give you the say  the way a human would say bring you  personality whether you liked it or not  chat GPT will actually respond to the  personality you ask it for um since  Shauna I know you love Reese Witherspoon  I asked it to impersonate L Woods seeing  chat GPT for the first time and this is  what it came back with it features  phrases like you got this  um and it's like your part it's like  your pink highlights Bend bend and snap  it was it was really cute it was really  cute I was Charmed by it um but that  said despite our the third thing that's  important here is that despite our how  impressed we are with some of the  creative work chat GPT was  I actually founded limitations to be  substantial particularly when it comes  to these kind of creative tasks for  instance it's not putting songwriters  out of business anytime soon I've had to  do a couple of songs but in this  particular case I asked it to provide  the lyrics to a song by The Clash and it  couldn't complete the response actually  today it is the only thing I have asked  chat GPT where it couldn't give me that  response so though there's a lot about  chat gbt that is awesome is interesting  um it's certainly not the easiest  interview I've ever done  and and you had that chat GPD answer a  question on my behalf what was that  how'd it go I has you were interested in  asking about the jobs question what kind  of jobs chat gbt is possibly coming for  and chat GPT was a little defensive what  it was saying is these are jobs I can  help with these are jobs I can assist  with but it said it was not coming for  those jobs however I actually have run  this response by an expert who disagrees  he says that there are actually  implications for call center jobs  knowledge jobs entry-level jobs what  we're seeing here Dave is chat GPT  spouting the party line as it were and I  really like this question because it  gets at the Crux of why we're so  fascinated we're we're afraid of how  it's going to reshuffle our world we're  fascinating we're afraid we're afraid  and we're fascinated and I don't expect  that to stop anytime soon we need a him  or her right like I I don't believe it I  believe it is coming for all of our jobs  Ali garfinkel but uh I'm old yours too I  worry for you young people  Ally thanks so much  well it's a big week for Tech as  Microsoft earnings kicks things off with  a less than desired outcome as its  worrisome guidance hits other Mega Tech  names we're here to dig deeper on  Microsoft and the rest of the tech space  is Robert Simpson Oak Associates co-cio  good to see you Robert so as we were  taking a look through some of the  revenue drivers there for Microsoft  Azure stood out and we know that that  you said that that's one to watch but  obviously getting a lot of the headlines  is that investment in open AI if you're  Microsoft how should you be putting your  Capital to work right now  while we think the open AI investment  into chat uh GPT is the type of decision  you want to see from a mega cap Tech  name like Microsoft we do not want to  see them uh sacrifice those  opportunities to the likes of Google or  Amazon or Facebook so we're encouraged  by that sort of investment for the  future  and so as we look at Azure especially  and where it's going from here and then  when you compare it to what we're seeing  with the cloud business some of these  growth drivers that allow them to be  able to pour Innovation into these other  sectors what are your expectations for  the cloud business  well the cloud is certainly the growth  business for Microsoft and when we look  at the stock today you know it's really  A Tale of Two Cities they have the PC  business which is slowing and mature and  then they have growth in the cloud  business and uh you know that's  definitely the area that's the the  market is watching it's been successful  and a little softening going forward is  to be expected because after all this is  a you know a 52 billion dollar Revenue  uh company uh it's hard to maintain that  Revenue growth and I understand that  businesses are kind of uh rationalizing  their spend after two years of trying to  be more efficient more productive coming  out of covid  and so but then I know that one of the  negatives that you highlighted was the  current valuation especially when you  look at say a Google or a meta how how  are you um when you think of whether  valuations might go from here what do  you think might actually work in  Microsoft's favor since they don't do  still have such a high valuation  well I think they've been benefiting  from the idea that that as a mega cap  tech company there is some Safety and  Security in their in their size and  their market cap but when you when you  separate Microsoft into those two  industries of being a legacy PC company  and a growth Cloud company the valuation  multiple should probably somewhere in  between of those two businesses and  unfortunately it's not it's definitely  more towards the higher end at 24 times  uh next year's earnings uh price to  sales of almost nine times those are  pretty rich multiples when other Tech  names have similar growth opportunities  uh but are trading at much more  reasonable valuations you know whether  it's Google at 18 times earnings or  Facebook at 13 times earnings uh other  Mega cap names just don't have that  premium and we think that the upside is  still good in those areas  and so when we look at some of the  issues that we're still dragging in from  2022 the macroeconomic backdown FED  continuing to tighten albeit at a slower  Pace when you look at some of the  perhaps the potential for the biggest  winners this earning season in Tech who  stands out to you  well we do like the semiconductor space  um people forget it's a boom and bust  cycle and semiconductors and uh you know  we had some Supply disruptions during  the pandemic  um but valuations have contracted  sharply China is reopening the appetite  for semiconductors is still very strong  so you know as an industry uh there's  some inventory that needs to be worked  off in some of the more industrial  automotive and PC names but it's still a  growth industry that you can get access  to at a much more reasonable evaluation  knowing that has a long tail of growth  behind it  and Robert I want to ask you about about  Laos obviously we've seen Microsoft part  of that as well with its own set of 10  000 layoffs haven't heard anything from  Apple yet Apple have done hiring freezes  but haven't made those cuts yet do we  expect much deeper Cuts overall for Tech  and why do you think we haven't seen it  for Apple yet  you know that's a good question uh I  expect we probably will at some point  um all of the tech companies were  aggressive and hiring during the  pandemic uh they kind of benefited from  the work from home trade and then  enabling other companies to move to a  more uh distributed Workforce  environment  um and there's going to be need to be  some rationalization of that Workforce  going forward so I think that the the  layoffs we've seen from a lot of the  major tech companies is probably just  round one I think Microsoft hired  something like 75 000 people over the  last four years and last year head count  was up over 19  so as these tech companies make their  own expense reductions headcount's going  to be a big area  you know but I of course we know that  Tesla's reporting after the Bell but I  do want to ask you about musk a lot of  people especially investors frustrated  about the distractions you have Twitter  you have the ongoing shareholder lawsuit  how do you think this is all going to  pan out for Tesla since it does have  some very ambitious production targets  now  well you know Tesla has a great product  a great car  um but the stock has been very volatile  and elon's personality is affecting its  share price so uh while the underlying  product is good  um you know it the the high valuation as  well as some significant changes in the  competitive environment over the last  two years I think every major automaker  now has a lineup of EVS available and  Tesla is no longer uh you know the best  uh option for some people so given the  changes in the competitive landscape you  know the text the Stock's Been Under  Pressure uh elon's been a little bit of  a distraction and as a result it may not  ever receive the premium fan base or  valuation that had it had a enjoyed  previously  certainly it's a very different time  we're living in now in the EV space  Robert Simpson there Oak Associates  co-cio thank you for joining me this  morning  shares of Microsoft were down pretty  considerably early in the day but now  largely flat and shares a Google down  nearly three percent as we found out the  road ahead for big Tech looks a bit  bumpy after Microsoft earnings report  but Microsoft may have the decided  Advantage right around the next Corner  the company betting 10 billion big on  open Ai and specifically chat GPT CEO  saty Nadella saying its impact will be  quote at the magnitude of the personal  computer the internet mobile devices and  the cloud so now is the director of the  MIT initiative on the digital economy  and the offer author of The Hype machine  nice to see you sir how considerable do  you think that Advantage will be for  Microsoft  well I think time will tell but I think  it's an excellent bet a billion to start  10 billion to follow on in the  investment and uh as we have seen  recently uh it has Google shook a little  bit uh calling a code red calling big  names back to the company to talk about  it to think about strategy and there's a  good reason for that chat GPT is  potentially an existential threat to  Google's business because Google relies  sixty percent of its revenue on search  and chat GPT offers an alternative to  search which is a One-Stop question  answering shop powered by AI Microsoft  has been struggling to compete on search  with Bing although they've been doing  better over the years but this could  change the game of search entirely which  is core to Google's business  so Zenon if you were talking to Google  right now Google's trying to figure out  how to get that edge back considering  this massive threat from chat GPT what  could what should they do  I think there has to be a combination of  investments in external players as well  as internal Investments uh to refocus  and streamline their approach to AI  obviously Google is no slouch in AI they  have some of the smartest Minds in deep  learning machine learning and  statistical modeling however their  applications of AI have not been  competitive with things like chat GPT  and if you think about chat GPT and  generation or generative models more  broadly we're talking about text and  images and even computer code that can  be generated by Machine learning  Technologies and after gpt3 there will  be four or five imagine what GPT 10  looks like you could see it replacing  all sorts of functions in Tech and  that's why it's such an existential  threat Investments externally  Investments internally streamlining and  focusing the approach to Ai and inside  Google I'm going to transform just about  every industry including education chat  GPT pass the U.S medical licensing exam  the bar exam and got a B on a Wharton  MBA paper you as an MIT Professor how is  it going to transform uh the entire  educational practice  I think it is extremely disruptive but  potentially in a good way in that we  have to learn to teach differently we  have to learn to race with machines  instead of against them to use the words  of Eric benelson and Andrew McAfee and  the New York City Public Schools were  trying to ban the use of these types of  language models I don't think that's the  right approach I think what we have to  do is we have to change the way we  educate we have to reskill and based on  our education focus on things that  complement artificial intelligence  rather than try to compete with it or  ban it or slow it down it's potentially  a way to enhance and augment and scale  creativity but it has to be used in a  way that's complementary with human  skills and that's going to be the next  challenge for the labor force as well so  now I'm talking about real quick just a  flip side of it because there still is I  mean there certainly is a lot of fear  out there just about what this could do  not only to the education system what it  could do for jobs and the broad  implications of this technology  well we're experiencing one of the  greatest upheavals uh in the labor  market that we've seen a long time you  can imagine human history punctuated by  several of such Transformations The  Agrarian Revolution the Industrial  Revolution and now the information  revolution which is an essentially an  accelerated exponential change at the  current moment even compared to 20 years  ago with the Advent of large language  models scalable machine learning and AI  that is the story of our time with  regard to the economy and it will  displace jobs it will create what's  known to economists as skill biased  technical change technical change that  favors some skills and complements some  skills and substitutes for or competes  with other skills and every time in  human history that we have experienced  something like this we've had to reskill  and change our focus on what humans did  and what machines did in order to create  complementarities and increase welfare  across the board and that's what we are  challenged with doing today as companies  as policy makers and as workers  it's not it was my hope that my kids  didn't really know what chat GPT was boy  was I wrong they laughed they said all  their friends are using it I'm not sure  how I'm not sure if they're cheating  what would you tell parents how should  we handle this the fear is our kids are  not only cheating but their inability to  form their own opinions is in Jeopardy  what should we do  funny you asked that I was going to say  that they probably knew before you did  as I'm sure that my 90 year old knew  before I did as the father of a  nine-year-old uh I do not want to scare  him away from this type of Technology  although we have strict limits for  screen time at our house  um I want him to play with it I want him  to experiment with it I want with I want  him to understand how to use it I want  him to uh think about how he might work  with it rather than try to keep him off  of it or to keep him away from it we  have to learn how to use complementary  Technologies like this to Aid us extend  our creativity to scale human thought  and I think that starts with young  Generations frequently they're the  innovators we're the laggards maybe they  should show us what we should be doing  with it uh certainly cheating is  should be something that you parent away  from at all times from an ethical and  moral standpoint and that using  technology not to cheat but to knowingly  and transparently address the  technological Revolution is the right  way to go about it in my mind there's  some great tips there and so now my kids  are a little bit too young but I will  keep a lot of that advice in mind in the  coming years not or all thanks so much  rise of the robots Microsoft is betting  big on AI with its multi-billion dollar  investment in chat GPT but what is it  battle Finance exam Kathy joins us now  for a breakdown all right hit us with  the Vibes of chat GPT Dan  the fives indeed so Chad gbt is an AI  powered chat bot basically it provides  you with human sounding answers to  different queries and you can actually  ask it a number of different types of  queries I asked it yesterday uh how to  make a meatloaf uh it's not going to be  as good as my mom's but it was a decent  recipe or you can ask it to do things  like come up with random stories I asked  it to make up a story about a maniac  Barber who eats human hair and he did it  did just that it can also answer  follow-up questions so if you ask you  know uh what is the Bible uh how long is  it it can provide you with some of those  answers it's actually developed by a  company called open Ai and it's only one  of a number of artificial intelligence  initiatives that they have going it was  founded in 2015 uh by a number of  researchers that includes uh former  stripe CTO Greg Brockman he currently  serves as president and the current CEO  is Sam Altman he's the former president  of Y combinator part of getting that off  the ground though included a number of  investors including the likes of Elon  Musk uh Peter's heel and AWS they all  committed an additional an initial one  billion dollars to get this research  going in 2019 though Microsoft came in  and provided another a billion dollar  investment so they had already been in  there they also at that point became the  exclusive uh Computing partner for open  AI so they have that edge in there  already in addition to this new 10  billion dollar investment uh musk who I  mentioned was one of those initial  investors actually stepped away from the  company in 2018 it was also a co-chair  for the company uh because he had been  critical of the company and the way it  had been operating he doesn't think that  it's being open enough uh despite their  name open Ai and the fact that they're a  non-profit so then what are the risks  for something like chat GP PT well the  software can be inaccurate and it can  provide answers that are wholeheartedly  incorrect you can ask it certain answers  and it'll provide them and they'll just  be flat out wrong and that's just  because of the way it's trained there  are people who go in and look at some of  these queries to determine whether  they're correct or not and they try to  correct it but there's only so much so  many people can do on such a large  platform the other issue is that chat  GPT was only trained on data from 2021  and before so if you ask it events that  have happened in 2022 or 2023 it's just  not going to know that it's not  connected to the web the information  from 2021 and prior was pulled down and  then it was trained on that so it's not  like you can ask it what the weather's  going to be uh or you know who won the  games on Saturday and Sunday in football  and the other thing is that there's  fears that it could start to push people  out of jobs that otherwise uh you know  they would be able to perform without  issues so think things like right  writing for instance or some kinds of  you know secretarial work there's fears  that chat GPT if it continues to develop  could simply take over those roles and  the other issue and this is something  that musket brought up was this is  initially a non-profit company now it's  a profit-capped company where they're  only allowed to reach a certain level of  Revenue and then the rest of that goes  into non-profits so there's this kind of  change in how the company has been run  over time that's kind of raising some uh  concerns but obviously not a big issue  for Microsoft with that 10 billion  dollar investment and Dan you have to  think that this uh chat GPT will also  disrupt Microsoft's own products right  yeah so the the big thing for Microsoft  here is that this could give it an edge  over the likes of Google and Amazon to  as well as Salesforce frankly you know  Microsoft competes with Salesforce in  the Enterprise if they add capabilities  like uh what chat GPT is uh capable of  then it could provide a better overall  experience for Enterprise customers as  far as Google it could add the  capabilities that you would want in a  search engine like Bing now as I said  this is not built for search engines but  the capability to respond to people in a  human-like manner that's something that  we could see added to Bing look Google  makes up 90 something percent of uh  search engine Marketplace in the world  I don't know if Bing's gonna Eclipse  that with just one addition uh but you  know it could give them a leg up and  then as far as Amazon goes if they add  these capabilities to Azure it could  make that platform all the more  appealing to customers Amazon's the  number one cloud provider in the world  Microsoft's Azure is number two if  Microsoft can really get the edge here  then it could start to muscle out Amazon  so there are huge benefits to Microsoft  with this 10 billion dollar investment  and as I spoke to uh some analysts  yesterday they basically said look you  know they made this 10 billion dollar  investment after laying off you know  thousands of people it shows how  important this investment is to them  then yeah we'll Finance is Dan Halley  with the analysis appreciate it  open ai's chat GPT is smart enough to  pass a final MBA exam at the Wharton  School that's according to one of the  University's professors so how does  higher education know it's a student or  a computer program submitting their next  paper enter gbt 0 the new program  created by a 22 year old Princeton  student allows users to copy and paste  text and test whether it was computer  generated GPT 0 test the text and  provides a perplexity score followed by  a GPT 0 score that zero score determines  whether the text is human generated in  the result you're watching now the New  Yorker article shown was in fact written  by a human joining us now is the creator  of GPT zero Edward TN Edward great to  see you Bravo how do you know this is  absolutely foolproof and do you get a  sense of how prevalent cheating is with  chat GPT  uh first thank you so much for having me  it's a pleasure to be here uh I would  say yeah GPT zero was something I built  over my holiday break uh just at my  local coffee shop in Toronto and I was  completely blown away at Hollywood just  literally went viral uh it is not  foolproof uh yeah we put a disclaimer  not to have any make definitive academic  decisions off the beta but what we have  done is put up a product Vape list for  educators that are interested in using  it  um professionally and so far over 23 000  Educators from more than 40 States and  30 countries have signed up for that so  we're really excited Edward you make it  sound so easy I think if I was tasked  with this I don't know if I could do  this over an entire lifetime but what  was your motivation for this because I  know you're writing your thesis about Ai  and you have a lot of interest just  about Ai and the role it will  potentially play in the future  yeah for sure  um aside from the research and academic  interests I think the concern was the  immediate need in terms of Education uh  to sort of adopt this technology  responsibly because I'm not against you  know students using chat GPT instead I'm  actually four students should in our  generation should be exposed to these  new technologies but it has to be done  responsibly and fairly but as well as  bigger concerns in terms of bots I've  looked at in the past uh with with uh  with like over internship with the VVC  like Bots Twitter disinformation as well  as fake news being generated by these  texts that's all of concern uh and we  need to have tools and safeguards so  these Technologies are used and not  abused  what are you hearing from teachers what  are you hearing from students that gets  you it gives you a sense of again how  prevalent cheating is with this  technology  I would say in terms of from teachers  the reception has been phenomenal uh in  fact uh I was just back in my high  school this Friday and talking to all my  teachers and my own high school English  teacher was telling me that yeah  students like they have no doubt that  their students are all using this but  what's exciting is some teachers are  thinking about also integrating chat GPT  in their curriculum in terms of maybe  asking it to help generate uh writing  topics or prompts so it's the jury's  still up in how educators are adopting  these Technologies because these  Technologies are here uh we can't ignore  that we have to build the tools to adopt  it responsibly  about exactly how this works when it  comes to detecting cheating or or if  someone if a human in fact wrote this  what are the certain things that you're  looking for in order to alert that  teacher that Professor that this has  actually been plagiarized  yeah one of the indicators that gpt0 is  looking for is burstiness a burstiness  in a sense is variance in writing uh in  terms of you can think of it that humans  have creativity and because our our  short-term memory we have sudden bursts  and creativity and differences in our  writing while machines have pretty  ubiquitous and constant writing over  time especially if these machines are as  powerful as cat GPT the New York Public  Schools recently banned use of chat GPT  do you think districts around the  country should follow suit  no I actually don't believe that's the  right approach at all uh first of all if  I was a high school student I'd just be  using chat TPT on my own public Wi-Fi  um or Wi-Fi at home instead of at  schools secondly these Technologies are  here and I absolutely believe uh AI is  here to say it is the future and  students shouldn't be taking away the  opportunity to interact it should be  adopted responsibly as well as soon um  you know chat GPT will cost money so  it's no longer just a responsible AI  issue but also an equity issue because  students in low-income neighborhoods  might just never have access to this  technology when students in higher and  income neighborhoods might be paying for  it but if there's a blanket ban then we  actually don't know uh where it's being  used as well yeah certainly many factors  to consider here ever when it comes to  GPT zero I know it's only been several  weeks here but I'm sure you've gotten a  tremendous amount of interest from VCS  maybe some larger firms that are showing  interest in you and also your product  have you gotten that interest in one of  those conversations been like  yeah it's uh it's actually super  exciting uh yeah those from your media  being a journalism student uh this is  like really exciting for me to talk to  people as well as being able to talk to  VCS I would say uh at the moment we're  focus on the engineering and actually  building this tool out uh and and soon  yeah we're happy to think more on on the  business side in terms of individual  Educators how this looks like is that  I'm pretty committed to keeping GPD Zera  or at least a copy and paste and hit  enter online version free forever we do  want to have a tool that everybody can  access because it is an important uh  tool to have and I think everyone  deserves a tool like TV's era to use as  well Edward what do you think the most  the best practical application for this  technology is we've heard theories all  over the map but you've studied it where  do you think we'll see it develop the  best in our economy in our Society in  the next couple of years  yeah I think like AI generation is going  to be everywhere in fact I actually use  it in my own coding I use copilot which  is GPT for code generation uh just like  chat GPT is GPT for chat generation so  it's really going to be big hooda's I  know Microsoft is already looking at uh  implementing open AI models into their  products as well so it's really going to  be more and more accessible  Edward in terms of the advantage that  Microsoft now potentially has because of  the investment with openai and chat GPT  is there anything out there from your  experience from the research that you've  done that's even close to where Chachi  BT is today  yeah I would say  um in terms of uh like research as well  there's many many other models that are  doing those work not just uh like open  AI models uh but there's uh models in  different countries  um there's I know Ting Hua university  has lots of research in uh natural  language models as well as bird-based  models  um uh so as opposed to these GPT base  models but I really don't think anything  has broken the barrier in terms of  accessibility like chat GPT has uh no  other uh group really comes close in  terms of how popular chat GPT has been  used just a quick question any of your  Princeton classmates furious at you for  developing this product  uh I wouldn't say so I think it's it's  it's been pretty awesome my classmates  have all been pretty supportive uh  professors as well have been pretty  supportive including my own thesis  advisor they're they're all pretty  pretty uh happy and proud all right I  got a 15 year old at home was not so  happy with you Edward T and  congratulations good stuff great to have  you not much thank you so much for  having me  Microsoft confirmed today it is  investing 10 billion dollars in open AI  over several years that brings the  valuation for the startup to 29 billion  as the tech giant looks to monetize chat  GPT now chatbot has become the talk of  Silicon Valley and everywhere else  including Brad's French table the  chatter caught the attention of Saws and  that's where we find it's like today  caught both of our attention in Davos  because a lot of people were talking  about it absolutely this was definitely  the world economic Forum where the next  generation of AI took form in large part  because of chat gbt so here are a couple  of Vibes you know that I thought about  from the weekend as I downloaded  everything we learned at the world  economic Forum as it pertains to open Ai  and chatbots like this first up you know  it's it is still seen as a helpful  useful tool at least off the Jump here  uh in in Bots like chat GPT I think a  lot of execs that we talk to do see a  strong use case for up for it and then  by extension you know because of that  use case it is seen as a major disrupter  for many Industries I know if I'm a  sales force to today which of course  bought slack there's a lot of I think  new apps coming that could ultimately  integrate into slack or or take market  share from slack if slack doesn't  involve just again using one example of  course because Salesforce is in the news  and then to that point likely to see a  lot of copycats chat GPT is not and  Microsoft are not the only players in  the space you know over the next year I  think you will see a lot of apps take  things even further in terms of  Technology like this so it could be used  in different applications you know one  person that we talked to at the world  economic forum is actually I would say  dabbling a little bit in the space and  very interested that is long-time Tech  investor uh Will I Am he's an  entertainer of course member of black uh  the Black Eyed Peas but also interested  in the space and also putting his mind  to work into it here's what he told us I  think  try GPT is awesome  um  I think it's going to be a great  co-pilot for creatives  um  and hopefully it raises the bar  on everyone's creativity now you have  something else that's  that responsive  you could push it it will push you  think it's awesome it's like asking a  mathematician hey what do you think  about this thing called the calculator  I'm glad he mentioned calculator and  math because the street has seen to zero  in on a company like Chegg you know we  talked to Dan rosenswig at the world not  reform Julie but they have seemed to  zero in on Chegg as potentially being  among the first companies to be  disrupted uh in this market here Brent  Phil over Jeffrey's noting this uh the  chat gbt could be an overhang on check  shares for for a good bit now he tested  this app and he says it will be it is a  long way away from uh writing accurate  essays or being a major player in  education so it could be something that  hangs over the stock but again nothing  at least near term uh that might take  market share market share away from a  check all right so what's the take take  is this uh I think this stuff is here to  stay I think you're you're going to see  some really amazing applications over  the next year and and to that point  please save me time uh I'm okay with  using this if I can use it to write or  help my daily workflow and shave off a  couple minutes by the end of the day  maybe that means I actually eat lunch  and dinner I'm all for it sign me up  yeah I mean look here I agree totally  but it's also some of this AI technology  and even some of the intellectual  property that has been patented for more  than a decade some of it at this point  has really only been affordable by large  businesses and so now once some of those  patents start to roll off it's going to  become more available it's going to be  able to be more open source and  available for the individual apps that  we might use well and when we talk to  Jan rosensweig by the way he was not  overly concerned about AI he talked  about them hopefully harnessing it in  their products instead of being you know  being disrupted by or being being a big  competitor to what they do I will say  SAS if you work hard now and don't eat  lunch ai's not going to change that oh  thanks I always just always neither is  all of my nagging so you're always  looking at first can't do it here's my  bulb you're always looking at burst you  just stuck another pen in it really  thank you I appreciate it that's what  I'm here nice to be back  treasury secretary Janet Yellen will be  staying in her role Bloomberg reporting  that in mid-December President Biden  asked Yellen to remain in her post there  has been speculation that Yellen would  leave her position following midterms  Yellen is likely to be a key figure in  the administration and Republicans are  forced to battle over the raising debt  ceiling so Jenny Yellen Bloomberg  reporting staying in her role Dave  stability very good Microsoft meanwhile  reportedly investing a whopping 10  billion dollars in students favorite  homework killer chat GPT let's talk  about that with a reporter that broke  the story semaphore's Liz Hoffman Liz  good to see you tell us what you know  about this investment and effectively  will Microsoft become the owner of chat  GPT  yeah thanks for having me it's good to  be here I I do think the right way to  think about this is an m a deal I mean  10 billion dollars is just magnitudes  larger than any Venture uh you know  single Venture investment that we've  seen and so you know at the end it's a  complicated deal um we can talk a little  about that if you want but Microsoft  will end up owning about half of this  company and really sees it as just an  incredibly important strategic bet uh on  the future of technology let's talk  about the details of that deal because  it is a little complicated just in terms  of how much money they're getting over  the number of years and a lot of that  tied to Performance  yeah I should say we don't we don't know  everything we don't know what we don't  know and and Microsoft uh has declined  to comment on this  um but it would be phased in over a  number of years it also might include  Microsoft had done an earlier investment  in open AI  um in the form of credits because the  biggest cost uh I mean really the  massive amount of money that chat GPT  spends it spends on cloud computing  because every time uh to your point a  student tries to get an essay written by  by a chatbot or just like you and me who  have found this incredibly fun and  addicting uh it costs the company like  like two cents every time someone uses  it so uh they're just bleeding money in  server costs so there's some serious  cash coming in  um but you know for them uh Cloud  credits are almost as good and you know  Microsoft 2 is really buying buying  market share for its Cloud business  which is the number two behind Amazon  but that's an incredibly competitive  business between Amazon Google and  Microsoft and a lot of these these big  companies who have a ton of cash in fact  actually been using it to make  investments remember a couple years ago  Google put a billion dollars into CME  exchange as part of that they were going  to move basically their a lot of their  cloud computing needs to Google so these  are strategic in a bunch of different  ways for Microsoft  uh you mentioned that chat GPT is  bleeding money in your words on uh open  AI on chat GPT  um is there plans to start charging for  those transactions that you mentioned  I'm always surprised and I'm on there  and it's not charging me if not what are  the practical applications to begin  profiting from this technology  yeah I mean you know that's always the  problem with with early stage companies  at some point they need to figure out  how to monetize you guys have done an  incredibly good job  um winning the attention game  um and so they need to figure out how to  flip that switch uh the answer is  there's a ton of applications I mean  first of all Microsoft you know plans to  use this in their software right we've  made a lot of clippy jokes in the last  the last 12 hours  um but but they were very early to that  game like I see you're trying to do this  can I help you right open AI uh the code  is so good it can help people figure out  how to do stuff in Excel right so it can  really make sort of technical software  that Microsoft uh sells just like a lot  easier and more user friendly which will  help them you know but I've also talked  to CEOs at unrelated non-tech companies  who think this can be a game changer for  customer service for client relationship  management  um that kind of stuff I mean just think  about how many how much of Twitter is  just people like like standing in line  at the airport and tweeting it you know  angrily at Delta so there's I mean  there's a lot of there are a lot of  applications you know I think and the  one we haven't talked about obviously is  search Microsoft you know Bing has been  really an afterthought to Google for a  long time  um interestingly you know like Google is  very good if you ask it a question it  will come back very reliably with and  point you to where you could find an  answer it's not that good at telling you  the answer uh it's trying to get better  at that you'll see some of their search  results are a little more uh kind of  natural language-y but they're kind of  they're kind of clunky and so you know  people really think this could be the  future of search yeah Liz I'm curious  just to get your personal take on this  because Morgan Stanley was out with a  note last month talking about I guess I  guess discussing more so how big of a  threat chat GPT could potentially be for  Google and its search business from what  you know from all the reporting that  you've done do you think it's going to  move the needle there  I'll say two things one is you know this  is it's a little bit like we've all been  promised flying cars and here we are and  we don't have them um this does feel  like the next big thing in Tech right  you had the internet in the late 90s you  had Mobile in the late 2000s and kind of  nothing since then so you know I just at  a high level I think this is really  directionally interesting  um but then you know the the the verdict  from the market today I don't know  exactly where they are right now but  Microsoft opened about a point up and  Google opened about a point down and  that's 35 billion dollars of market  value just swung between two Tech Giants  um so and by the way it's not often you  see investors in a company like  Microsoft cheer them putting a huge  amount of money into like a very nascent  technology at an incredibly High uh  price point so  um clearly the market thinks this is a  game changer and is uh is happy that  Microsoft is getting there first  Liz we haven't heard anything in the way  of competition have you and what is  stopping someone else from getting in  this game it doesn't seem like there'd  be a massive hurdle or barrier to entry  that's always the problem with Venture  right how deep is the moat and how big a  head start do you have  um I guess it really depends on there's  a couple of things right like is  computing power now a commodity like  maybe you could probably argue that it  is you've got the big players you know  the cost of cloud is always coming down  if you had like enough time to to kind  of feed the entire history of human  interaction into a a powerful enough  computer and you had enough money I  don't see why someone couldn't couldn't  uh couldn't replicate this I think  that's a real concern here that said  Head Starts are really helpful and they  have a very big one I mean fascinating  to see where this technology takes us  Liz Hoffman always great to have you f74  thanks so much  Microsoft is considering investing as  much as 10 billion dollars in chat GPT  Creator open AI according to Bloomberg  our next guest says the tech Giants  incorporation of chat GPT into Bing  could be a once in a decade opportunity  to upend Google's dominance D.A Davidson  managing director Gil Gloria joins us  now Gil make the case for why this could  be a once in a decade once in perhaps a  generation investment opportunity for  Microsoft  well if you think about where Google's  market cap comes from their 1.1 trillion  almost 60 percent of that comes from  their search business  so uh because that's because Google  search is so much better than Bing it's  10 times bigger business than Bing if  incorporating chat GPT into Bing makes  it competitive with Google search that's  the amount of market cap that Microsoft  could take away from Google in the order  of magnitude of 600 billion  in the short term Microsoft is  benefiting greatly because all this uh  data and computing power is going to its  azure  Cloud hosting business and so it's it's  money that they're investing that's  coming right back to Microsoft to grow  its most important business to Azure  business so it's a great investment for  Microsoft in a product that could really  help it transform its two key products I  mean Gil some would ask why Bing even  still exists right I mean it's  definitely like also Iran doesn't even  begin to cover it um Google's a verb  Bing is most definitely not so if you  could just walk us through in a little  more detail like what would a chat GPT  integration into being look like and why  would it be such a compelling offering  so when you use generative AI like Chad  GPT and you ask a question you get an  answer you get a thoughtful  well-articulated answer when you go to a  search engine today whether it's Google  orbing you don't get an answer you get a  list of websites where the answer may or  may not be and you have to continue  doing the work that really changes the  nature of how we get questions answered  and if you've played with child GPT at  all you know that it can answer a very  wide range of questions in spite of the  fact that technology is still developing  quickly so it's gonna There's an  opportunity here for us to completely  change how we find information we've  been Googling for 20 years and now we  may be in a situation where we no longer  Google we ask a question and we get an  answer  so you think Gil Bing takes down Google  and do you think Google is working on  something like this  oh absolutely Google's working on a  product called Lambda that should be  able to do the same thing but what we're  hearing is that it's not quite as good  as Chad GPT yet and so that's one aspect  that gives being this opportunity to be  competitive and take significant market  share and then the other aspect of this  is that Google relies on its current  advertising business model for almost  its entire business and 57 percent of  its Revenue comes from advertising  through Google search if they were to  change the way we do search to start  answering questions instead of giving us  a list of websites that would very much  disrupt their business so Google will be  encounter the classic innovators dilemma  do they destroy their own business in  order to stay ahead or do they try to  slow down progress if they try to slow  down progress that gives being that  inner that inner run into the ability to  uh to gain market share how long does it  take for Microsoft if they're successful  with chat gbt to upend the Mind share  that initiates every search on Google  because of just how long that has been  kind of verified into our daily activity  and kind of standard operating practices  at on on a human basis right now  we're going to find out very soon some  of the reports out there is that Bing is  going to be incorporated with Chad GPT  as early as March and so we're going to  see how much better of a product it  turns out to be but if you think about  15 20 years ago when we all started  using Google it happened all of a sudden  we were using other search engines and  once Google became better everybody  started using it for everything very  quickly if there is a better search  engine out there if Bing plus chat GPT  is in fact better than what Google has  to offer people will switch very quickly  so Gail putting this all together there  have been reports that Microsoft is  thinking about investing more in open AI  which is the parent company of Chachi BT  maybe 10 billion dollars over a matter  of years it sounds like you think that  would be a fantastic idea I wonder what  you also think of the idea of if  Microsoft just bought it out right  well I'm not sure that's a possibility  for them I think the other investors are  quite prominent as well Peter thiely  Elon Musk they may not want to sell the  whole thing if Microsoft could maybe  they would either way they appear to  have exclusivity over the use of these  products they have they appear it's been  reported that the entire volume of data  and compute is going to Azure and that  Bing would have exclusively on using  chat GPT for search if that's the case  just making an investment should be good  enough  there is now a counter play as well to  any type of artificial intelligence kind  of either written product that that is  online or just the the general framework  of how artificial intelligence can be  kind of Incorporated within writing  papers people who are students who have  used chat GPT to be able to do this and  now the counter to that is the detection  mechanisms to understand what is  artificially intelligence generated  versus what is not how much is that a  major headwind for the success of chat  GPT in the future as well  there is going to be some cat and mouse  game especially in the field of  Education where teachers and professors  are going to try to figure out if  they're if the student actually wrote  the paper but realistically speaking the  next generation of this technology GPT  4.0 that's going to come out later this  year is going to be educated with a 10  to 100 times more data than the  generation we're now using which is to  say when you say write me an essay on  this topic that's one thing but when you  can start saying write me an essay on  this topic as if I'm an eighth grader  and make some mistakes so the teacher  doesn't catch me and child GPT does that  no it's going to be very hard for  teachers to get that okay so that kind  of braces the question of whether there  is a an ethical responsibility that  needs to be layered into how this  operates how this artificial  intelligence is able to be incorporated  regardless of how good it can be in kind  of streamlining search results or  simplifying some tasks that are  otherwise uh you know just uh just  onerous you know where is that extra  layer of Ethics within how this  artificial intelligence operates  that's a greater question that's the  most important question right now in  fact I believe when using chat GPT that  it's being throttled and governed by  open AI to not do anything and and say  anything and one of the reasons Google  is holding back on Lambda is  specifically that that once you unleash  this and and give it all the  capabilities it can it might do things  that we are uncomfortable with and that  we really have to figure out the ethics  around and we need to do it now because  these capabilities are very very uh  significant and so that responsibility  right now Falls to Google and it falls  to open Ai and we we better hope that  they're trying to be ethical about it  because the capabilities are very  significant well you know big Tech has a  long history of being ethical gills so  we're I'm sure we're a good answer we'll  talk more about that in the next time go  Lauria D.A Davidson managing director  thank you so much really interesting  perspective on a fast donating ongoing  story appreciate it  well here's a question for you what  measure is a machine open AI the  research and development team behind  viral Bots like chat GPT and Dolly 2  could see a valuation of up to 29  billion dollars this at least according  to multiple reports out from the ft and  the Wall Street Journal the developer  open AI is in discussions with Venture  Capital firms including Peter thiel's  Founders fund and Thrive Capital the  Bots have recently gone viral for their  ability to generate realistic looking  text and images but while openai says it  can generate Revenue by charging for  usage of its products that idea remains  untested in markets um Rochelle I feel  like there's some context necessary here  because  29 billion dollars would make open AI  one of the most valuable U.S startups  and we're talking about a company as we  said that has some Skeptics who say like  how do you actually generate Revenue out  of this now last year or we should say  two years ago 2021 this is a company  that was valued at 14 billion dollars so  we're talking 15 billion over where it  is and of course this comes at a time  when we have heard from so many VCS and  startups who have had to slash their  valuations because people are growing a  little more skeptical about these  companies ability to grow so in that  context a 29 billion dollar valuation  especially largely based on chat GPD  which was just launched in November  that's a significant upside  I mean you want to talk about just a  turnaround story for more than doubling  your valuation in two years and as we  mentioned on something that's largely  untested and even open AI CEO Sam Altman  saying look there are still some  glitches in the technology and as we're  seeing a lot of VCS pulling back on  investing on some of these sort of  riskier businesses we saw that  um just in the last in the last quarter  we saw that some of these predictions  especially from Pitch books saying that  last quarter month the first time in a  decade the Venture Capital acquisition  deals actually fell below a billion  dollars and so we're not really seeing  that momentum so it's interesting to see  so much interest now as people jump onto  the what we're seeing with chat GPT  um now obviously this could pit you know  Google against Microsoft with this so it  might be a case of sort of fear of  missing out and wanting to sort of get  in there early but I mean these  valuations are really Off to the Races  right now  open AI the creator of chat GPT is  reportedly considering a tender offer  that would value the company at 29  billion dollars this news has garnered  significant attention in the tech  industry as it reflects the growing  importance and potential of artificial  intelligence in today's market open ai's  research and development in the field of  AI have earned it a reputation as a  leader in the industry and this  valuation serves as a testament to the  company's Innovative work and potential  for growth in the future guess who wrote  that not me not my producers not Shauna  chat GPT itself  very impressive that the technology was  able to do that the one thing I will say  is that it's a little bit it's much more  boring to put it plain here than what  you typically write than what humans  typically write just in terms of the  emotion the feeling that goes into  writing right now the variation you  don't necessarily see that I don't think  reflected in that script you read it  well though you disagree with me I  Juiced it up a little bit but serves as  a testament I thought it was solid I  thought it was solid B plus work  definitely solid and I'll give it B plus  I mean even give it an A minus but I do  think about the valuation evaluation 29  billion valuation certainly a massive  bet I think on the future of this  company when you take into account what  it's done while trap gbt that technology  here extremely impressive Reuters had  reported last month that the company  only expected to make 80 million in  Revenue last year in 2022 so 29 billion  dollar valuation really speaks to the  potential adoption of this and what the  future could look like when  incorporating this type of Technology  yeah I'm really curious what the  monetizing element of this is I didn't  pay any money to use this my kids who  have used it quite often they aren't  paying any money we know they've talked  about incorporating it in bing as search  that's a pipe dream at best anybody  competing with that Google space just  doesn't look quite frankly likely at all  a lot of the students who are using it  that they are not paying for it and that  is an interesting aspect to watch  because New York City public schools  have now banned chat GPT not just among  students but among the teachers as well  now that doesn't mean you can't use it  at home you can only not use it when  you're on their Wi-Fi or on their  networks you might be on their  school-issued laptops and speaking of  schools moving to bend and I think the  big question here is how you regulated  how you keep students from using this to  cheat and it was pretty interesting  there's actually a student from  Princeton is a computer science student  there at the University he has built an  app it's called GPT zero and he's saying  that it can quote quickly and if  efficiently label whether an essay was  written by a person or whether it was  written by chat GPT in fact the reason  the word or I guess the ability here to  determine that is the variation that  they use or lack thereof that's included  in what chat GPT rates I'm just so  impressed that someone has already built  an app that could potentially detect  this in such a short amount of time  because remember this is only launched  what the end of November just over a  month ago it is moving at light speed  impressive we shall see where it's  headed  [Music]  uh Ali I think this has implications  from everything from the high schoolers  and the college kids and how they do  their homework to how Google may or may  not dominate search in the future what's  coming  you know Dave I think it's worth saying  off the cuff that this was the year you  know contrary to the metaverse right  this was the year that AI really  crystallized in the public Consciousness  and of course we have a couple of  examples of that but most of them are  from open AI which developed chat GPT so  it's worth saying just off the cuff  number one people are interested that's  something that we have absolutely  learned this year so in the case of chat  GPT right it can do all sorts of things  right for those who are uninitiated it's  the most sophisticated chat bot that we  have ever seen on the market you know  and it's like like for instance today I  had it right a sonnet about what it  expects to see from 2023.  um it was very optimistic uh I'll let  you all I'll let you all read that on  your own time  um the other thing too before we talk  about the benefits and drawbacks of chat  shebt though Dave is that dolly was also  developed by open Ai and it emerged this  year I actually gave it a prompt that  you guys could see this is a uh a corgi  on a throne in a blue smoking jacket in  this style of Monet so both a  conversational Ai and AI art really made  a dent this year and as you said Dave  benefits and drawbacks right on one hand  it could change the search landscape  down the line I'm very hesitant about  that in the immediate term especially  because chat GPT right now is only  updated to about 2021 I believe so  anything you asked about 2022 for  example isn't going to be accurate that  said it's also important to talk about  you know the drawbacks for instance you  know one of the big ones you said fears  that it can help kids cheat on homework  but in the end I think it's worth saying  that this has captured imaginations of  people worldwide it's it's facilitated  hate it's facilitated love and I think  there's no doubt everyone's looking  around saying how can we leverage this  in Tech and otherwise  capture imagination certainly has  captured Dave's attention he loves  talking about it Ally and Dan thanks so  much for bringing that down again you  can uh read their article on Yahoo  finance.com next big thing in Tech five  things that you need to watch in 2023  open ai's new chatbot named chat gbt is  gaining online traction as users test  out the capabilities of this AI powered  information tool here to break it all  down with the details we've got Yahoo  finances ali garfinkel uh Ali to say  this is getting traction I think is an  understatement my Twitter feed at least  has been blowing up with people testing  this out  yeah it's it really it's really blown up  I don't know if I've ever seen an AI  tool go quite so mainstream and there  are a couple for anyone who's not as  chronically online as you and I are  there are a couple of things that are  really important about this the primary  one is this this is the most  sophisticated AI chat bot that we have  ever seen released to the general public  and it's it was developed by open AI in  San Francisco and its applications are  honestly pretty broad I've seen the  applications range from completely silly  like there's one that went viral about a  King James Bible verse about getting a  peanut butter sandwich out of a vcr and  you know the applications can also get  really scary for instance someone  figured out how to get past how to get  past some of the content filters and get  it to tell you how there's a Molotov  cocktail how to make a Molotov cocktail  so the range the range of applications  are broad but there are a couple of  simple ones some people are using it to  clean up their code other people are are  using it to help draft cover letters you  know there's been a lot of applications  surrounding college essays the way it  works is essentially you sign on and you  type a question much in the same way you  would to something else we're all very  familiar with Google search so I  actually went and tried it out myself  because I wanted to test out this idea  because there's a lot of Hub Hub being  like well you know this is something  that you know could eventually replace  Google and I think there are a lot of  things underlying that but I I asked it  a couple questions that you might ask  Google one of them was very benign it  was about French toast it might it'll  probably show up on the screen here in a  second here you go yeah I was just like  what's a recipe for French toast okay  that's a recipe and then it shows you  how it shows you how to make French  toast I also asked it a follow-up that  gave me excruciating details on how to  add chocolate dipped in so I think there  are a lot of questions that this poses  but there's no question it has gone  completely viral  I I love this I'll definitely be  checking that out a big thank you there  to Ali garfinko for us
