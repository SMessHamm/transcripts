 welcome everybody Welcome To The Future  Trends Forum I'm delighted to see so  many of you here today we have a very  very important and vital topic and a lot  to discuss today we're going to be  diving into one aspect of Automation and  its impact on higher education we're  going to be looking at the chat GPT  technology which is just appeared now  usually in the Forum we have one or two  guests who are special experts in the  topic but today we're putting together a  kind of hive mind of everybody who's  interested everybody who's practiced  with it along with some people who are  experts in different parts of it  including digital writing writing  pedagogy and artificial intelligence so  what we'd like to do is to get you all  thinking about this and one way to help  think about it is to use a few resources  we have in the bottom left of the screen  you should see it kind of tan color box  that says chat GPT or it says chat GPT  resources that'll take you to a web page  a blog post of mine which has a link to  a few dozen articles podcasts and videos  that may or may not be useful to you  trying to think about this so and in the  chat right now uh lee scouter Bessette  just shared uh her zotero Library which  is also available from that link there  thank you for doing all that Lee John  Hollenbeck asks if we could have just  invited Chad GPT to be a guest well  actually thought about that thought  about doing that um it's pretty popular  to use chat GPT just to give us some  some fun feelings and in fact I asked  chatgpt to describe the ideal video  conversation and this is what it said  the ideal video conversation will likely  be one where all participants are able  to clearly see and hear each other and  are able to easily communicate and  understand one another  for all participants with everyone  feeling comfortable and able to  contribute to the discussion the  conversation also likely to be  productive with participants achieving  their desired goals and outcomes from  the conversation well thank you chat GPT  I hope we'll strive to do just all of  that  so to begin with chat GPT was released  about 10 days ago this is the latest  version of a text chatbot created by  openai if you haven't used it if you go  to the links that we've provided you'll  be able just to log in through various  accounts and to start asking the chatbot  questions and what's powerful about chat  GPT is that it's able to draw on a  greater library of text than ever before  and seems to be more efficient and more  convincing at least in making stuff up  and in writing creating text than any  chatbot technology has been yet this has  triggered huge amounts of controversy  around the world the people decrying it  as the end of all uh possible writing  prompts in higher education threatening  jobs undoing writing as we know it  there's a whole bunch of ideas here and  today we'll be going through all of them  Ricardo parita the session has started  welcome I hope you can hear me so just  to begin with I would like to ask each  of you uh if you could just volunteer  some of your impressions of actually  using chatgpt if you have used it just  either type it in the chat box or right  click the raised hand and I'd be glad to  bring it up on stage so you can describe  it  oh let me bring Brett Anders from the  American University of Armenia and bring  him up on stage it's probably a crazy  time for you there Brent  welcome sir hello yes uh so yeah it is  11 p.m here so it's a little bit  oh you you look great sir you look great  oh thank you  um so yeah I wanted to volunteer I did a  little experiment today uh dealing with  uh chat GPT and that I I used to teach  freshman seminar here at the University  so I I told it I asked it I said hey  write a narrative essay about a special  event that occurred in your life right  and then I was trying to think I wanted  to be I wanted to make it as hard and  specific as possible so I said make it  from the Viewpoint of an Armenian make  it from the Viewpoint of someone that  was born in 2004 and make it to be an  impactful event that changed your life  and it had a you know major consequences  so I waited it took about five seconds  and it created 700 and I told it 750  words  it wrote about 500 words and it gave me  something that was really good uh very  surprisingly it was like this would be  passable and in my thoughts but then I  thought you know here we also teach the  seven step writing process because we're  trying to get people to to to do it  properly and so I said hey make me a  rough draft of this so it made me  another version that was a little bit  rougher and then I asked it wait a  second I'm going to need a uh an outline  and it made me an outline so then I took  this test a little bit further and then  I I stapled all three of these together  and I took it and I had two people that  I didn't tell them this was from chat  GPT I had three two people tested like  evaluated I said could you uh could you  grade this for me I just want to make  sure that I'm grading it in the same way  they graded it based off of the rubric  and uh they scored it uh a minus B plus  wow that's yeah that's sort of an  interesting little test that I did there  um again this is very interesting the  capabilities and the level of what it  did and as far as what it was it was a  pretty good story about uh an Armenian  who uh became a refugee because the area  is in dispute which happens a lot in  this country so they have to leave uh  their area and then they were in a  refugee camp and they so they gained a  greater appreciation for everything  and now that they're going uh you know  now that they're in a university they so  it was like this very interesting  personal story that seems very  believable on a lot of levels and it  felt emotional again narrative first  person so uh it was definitely  worthwhile so there's a lot of power  here  can I just ask you a couple of quick  questions about that sure so for you  this was actually a pretty easy process  to go through you simply type you type  in your prompts and it comes back an  answer in a few seconds  and and you iterated that you you got  one output and then you'd ask it to  develop it further  um on the back end uh this is this is a  tool that is using a tremendous amount  of digital texts uh so to to create this  it had to draw on various posts articles  ebooks written about Armenians including  our meetings of the 21st Century  yes so it uses um I I watched one video  talking about this and they said that it  has a library of over one billion words  um it's uh again this is taken from  pre-2022 so this is all up till 2021 so  nothing you know very current  uh so that would be one way to to  manipulate the prompt is by asking it  something modern as far as if you're  once we get to talking about pedagogy  and trying to prevent it from prevent a  student from using it um but yeah and  that's the other part is that the  iterative process so it can remember  what you just put in so that's why I was  able to have it make a draft and then I  was able to make it do an outline as  well because it can remember what it  just did  which is fascinating fascinating Brent  Brent uh we have another volunteer can I  keep you up on stage for a minute sure  okay well hang on a second we have uh  Rob Fentress from Virginia Tech let me  see if I can get him uh to join us hey  hello Rob hey how you doing good good to  see you yeah  um I'm excited to join in this  conversation because uh I've been using  chat GPT extensively since it came out  and um  it it boggles the mind if you have not  tried it already you need to do so soon  um I am already using it to uh to  increase my productivity tremendously  I've created lots of content uh in my  subject domain which is very specialized  uh web accessibility used to create  documentation for poorly documented  software  um and I am even interested in actually  using it as an instructional tool itself  because basically when you ask it a  question all right uh  you know it does a pretty darn good job  to start with but if you know if you  push it it will say things that are  wrong and and things that aren't always  obviously wrong but that are subtly  wrong so if what you're trying to do for  your students is get them to think  critically and determine whether they  really are understanding the content  then if you have them work and use chat  GPT and have a conversation about the  material that you're covering and part  of the assignment is for them to  interact with it and say no no chat DPT  you're subtly wrong here uh you need to  expand more uh and so forth I think  that's really genuine learning so you  know if people think about the negative  effects  um but I mean it's incredible but of  course you need to enjoy it while you  can because  I think we're doomed I mean it is that  powerful that we we have not solved the  AI alignment problem and you know it's  obviously not you know it's not uh  sentient maybe I don't know probably not  sentient but it is powerful enough and  they have not solved the ability to  restrict it I mean you can get around  all of its restrictions uh with certain  hacks and it could be used for great  harm and the next version GPT 4 which  this is 3.5 GPT 4 is supposed to be 500  times more parameters than GPT three  that's the rumor anyway so maybe you're  a trillion parameters  um Rob two two quick questions first did  you say the AI or the AL alignment  problem  uh AI alignment so basically the idea  that you know we have certain things  that we want the AI to do we're training  it with that in mind  um but uh there are all sorts of ways  that that can go wrong  um and we have not  come up with really robust solutions for  that and the uh actually the person at  openai AI the company that's responsible  for chat GPT I read I listened to an  interview with them uh just yesterday  where they talked about you know like  what are the dangers they had written a  paper about this in academic paper where  they basically said you know  here's all these problems we're not  close to solving them you know he tried  to put some positive gloss on it but  frankly his his more scary uh concerns  were much more convincing to me than the  very limited uh optimism I'm an  optimistic person as regards to AI but  I'm changing my mind  yeah you brought up a great Point as far  as the critical thinking aspect because  it does like to sort of fill things in  sometimes and there might be some  partial truths but it sort of decides to  put things together if they're not 100  percent true so that critical thinking  aspect is really important so I wrote an  article about how to use chat GPT in  higher education just in in general  instructing it and uh one of the things  that I did is in writing the article I  asked GPT to to to write the article for  me right and it did and I asked it  specifically one of the prompts was how  could I prevent a student from just  using it to sort of cheat right and so  it gave me all these great things and  one of the things that said is that oh  well you can use plagiarism detection  software to check your chat GPT that a  student might turn in to check it to see  if it's plagiarized well I tried the the  you know the one that I had it do for me  I ran it across four different  plagiarism detection softwares and all  of them came back as far as saying no  there's 100 original  but it's really it's like using a  calculator you know I mean on some  levels yes everybody is going to be  using this and that's going to be that's  not the skill that we're going to be  wanting people to learn we're going to  be wanting people to learn how to use  chat GPT to write essays for you which  is its own skill and that's the skill  we're gonna have to start  um  starts teaching I think rob you you  mentioned an example of that uh a few  minutes ago you mentioned the idea of  having a having students use GPT to  create something and then discussing its  flaws in class I'm reminded of he slips  my mind right now there's a historian  who had a clever final project for  students which they had to create a hoax  and they had to make it look as  convincing as possible  and they would publish it to the web I  don't know if the stirring's a bell for  any idea some of you might remember it I  was very controversial but the students  had to basically Master primary source  material to make like a fake ship in the  American Civil War or uh Benjamin  Franklin's lost uh beer recipe and that  kind of thing  um and the trick was they had to make it  convincing so they had to clearly know  the content but then to criticize these  to to discern the flaw you'd have to be  able to have that level of critical  thinking because that's something I'm  not saying discuss it in class I'm  saying discuss it with with chat gbt  have a conversation with it where you  try to refine  what it's provided you you know uh and  then you can share that you know like in  a forum or whatever and then yeah you  could have a you know talk about it I'm  just saying yeah processing going back  and forth with it is going to be very  informative yeah I mean and that's just  it like it's kind of scary because one  of the other tests that I did is I'm  writing this other book dealing with  consumer psychology so I like I took one  of the paragraphs and I gave it to to  chat GPT I said what do you think about  my my paragraph and chat vpt look at it  and it it gave me like excellent  feedback like this is the type of  feedback that I would give to a student  something that got me thinking wow I  could use chat GPT to provide feedback  to my students so and just like what  you're saying I could cut out the  middleman and say hey before you know  create your essay and then have chat GPT  check it to give you feedback and then  show it to me or some process thereof  where before it even and gets to me they  can go through and do several practice  essays on their own with chat GPT and  then now we're going to do this  assignment so there's so many different  levels and possibilities and I mean if  you use for instruction as well so I'm  giving a workshop  um coming up and uh I you know I always  get stressed out about things like that  and I tend to obsess over details I  don't know how to get started get  writer's block and so I've got a you  know a synopsis of the workshop just you  know just brief description for the  catalog and the title and I said okay  I'm going to be giving this one hour  Workshop here's the title here's the  description write an outline for me of  my presentation  and it did with like it's been 10  minutes on this five minutes on this  bullet points and  it's just it's stunning so it's it's  using all the workshops descriptions  that you and I and others have put up on  the web and uh and and com and extended  them very very nicely uh hang on one  second friends uh I just want to bring  up a third person who's had a hand  raised has been very patient  um and uh this is Phil  um oops hang on one second I'll actually  press the correct button uh this is  phillipa lingard who is the founder of  Vic  and let's see if we can  see if we can bring him up  there we go  hello Phil  oh Phil maybe having a connection  problem  hi Phil can you sit here us yes I can  see you I can see myself thanks no I  just wanted to Echo something which uh  Brett said that Chad GPT does make  mistakes  and  um it was I I was reading  um Charlie Cohen's  um blog yeah GPT about the philosopher  lock  and the answer came back completely  incorrect  and the reason is that lock and hops are  always compared and contrasted with each  other and it it actually described the  position of Hobbs uh being the position  of lock so  um it isn't there yet it does make  mistakes  um my concern is that what I'm going to  be doing is I'm going to be launching a  100 online Masters course and of course  that chat gbt is completely changed the  um whole landscape when it comes to  assessment  and uh and how they are going to be uh  replying  um my thoughts are I mean I'm very  fortunate in this and that the the  Masters program is designed for  practitioners is that  I really am going to need to design the  assessment questions to be deeply  personal  hmm  um now it's great where I'm taking  entrepreneurs and people in their 30s  who are mid-career  um and and and the whole the whole  objective of the course is all right  apply this  to your work environment  but obviously in a more traditional  higher education environment where  particularly if the bachelor's level  where students are absorbing and  learning then the assessment challenge  becomes very interesting  and I don't know what your thoughts are  on that  it does yeah I would totally agree that  the more personal that it can be made  then the greater the ability for the  that individual having having to  actually write it right but again it's  that aspect of  there's still a component of chat GPT  that I'll still be able to use no matter  what the prompt is yeah because yeah  because in essence what I'm doing is I'm  using it as an an added tool so you  could give me 50 prompts and I could use  you know 50 different things to put into  that group and it's going to give me  something now I still need to use  exactly what you were saying before as  far as critical thinking to then review  it and to say well no that's not quite  right but this is an overall building  block that I can take in enhance to make  it that much better the other big  problem that currently again it's  developing they said there's going to be  an update to a chat GPT Before Christmas  Even but currently it has a huge problem  trying to do in-text citations right I  was able to get it to give me references  at the very end so it kind of did that  okay on a small thing but in-text  citations well it won't do it at all  make sure to check those citations  because I've seen that they're actually  totally made up all right these two were  right I gave it a simple thing of of a  compare contrast essay of American  speeches so it was able to do that  record but again it was just two things  so yeah understood about the plagiarism  engine not spotting it  yeah well actually I read something that  they're actually working on uh that  they're working on  um basically watermarking of the text  somehow which is interesting I'm not  quite sure how that would work but even  if it does I would imagine if a  plagiarism detection software can  identify some pattern that reveals that  could also you know somebody could redo  it so that it doesn't do that so you  know now we're getting into to some of  this aspect right and I've tried playing  Devil's Advocate with this thing because  they in reality on some levels if we're  looking at it through the lens of  cheating right nothing nothing new has  happened  nothing has happened because I could  before this I could go to my buddy pay  him 50 bucks and he could write it for  me right so that's my chat gbt before  this I could uh there's plenty there's  multiple AIS that already exist so I  could just give it hey here's here's an  essay can you plagiarize this for me  sure here's a new version that's been  paraphrased that won't be detected by  plagiarism software because the AI made  a new version of it  so but what we're talking about here  with chat GPT is that right now at least  it's completely free and it's easy to  use I don't need to know code I just put  it in a text box and it magically  creates it because I'm just asking it  normal human question of hey write me an  essay about democracy uh you know that's  something that happened within the last  five years uh in China boom and it'll do  it instantly and then so that's trading  but if we can use it properly as a tool  then we can advance all of it I need to  I need to pause just for a quick  question  um the the chat box is on fire there is  an incredible amount of stuff in chat  let me let me just ask chat people is it  okay if I copy and paste this to a Blog  tomorrow I'll anonymize everybody remove  everybody's name just just let me know  in the chat uh if you're not using the  chat never mind  um sorry Brent please please go on or  I'm sorry I think it was Rob who started  to speak yeah  um  I mean where was Robinson yeah  can I just throw in this  um is this going to revive the Vivo  in other words the the  um assessment is going to be done by  effectively interview  yeah the oral oral interview yeah yeah I  mean that's that's one aspect that's one  possibility uh because I in talking to  some instructors here at this University  we talked about how there needs to be  more being done in class right as far as  we're actively doing things we're we're  engaging we're writing in class but and  I agree with that on some level but it  made me when I even when I was talking  about that it made me think of my my  time when I I had to take uh the GRE  right and when I did that it was so  artificial I had to go into a special  locked room there was a guard watching  me I couldn't use Microsoft Word I had  to use a blank basis basically text  entry that wasn't connected to the  internet and I did horrible and guess  what I think I'm a great writer I get  A's in my classes but I wasn't able to  write like I usually write  so if we make an artificial thing of  well you can't use the internet to write  because you might use chat GPT but now  we're kind of changing things and making  it artificial because the other big  thing that I come come back with and  again I'm always playing with Devil's  Advocate right because there's so many  instances right now where a student  graduates they go to their workplace the  workplace says hey I need you to write  this report for me and I need to do  tomorrow or in two days what are you  talking about this should take a week  all my assignments took a week oh well  you don't know how to use uh AI to make  this faster so companies and businesses  are requiring their employees to use AI  so if we in education or in Academia  aren't teaching the students  how to use a how to have ai literacy to  create documents properly they still  need to have that knowledge but if  they're not using it to enhance their  capabilities to make things faster to  have more output then they're going to  be suffering when they get out into the  real world where it's a requirement to  be able to have that skill and friend I  did remember what I was going to  responding I'm just going to say you had  mentioned  um the the fact that it's free and I  think that is that is an essential  component because I'd read about chat  gpt3 and I was like very intrigued and I  wanted to do it but you know it costs  money and I was like well it sounds like  there's the learning curve there and you  know so I held off but the fact that  this is free has it it makes it so much  more fluid you can just play around and  it'll be interesting to see once once it  costs money but I mean I don't care how  much it is I I'll so so I had the exact  same thought and I I because the thing  is like I've been trying to see like  okay because I'm trying to I I'm the I'm  also the director dealing with the  center for teach and learning here at  this University so I'm always trying to  help the instructors so I wanted to show  them I'm like hey this is how a student  can use AI right now to create things  before chat GPT right and it was  somewhat difficult because you had to  like find certain places and then it was  limited or you could pay 20 bucks and  then you could get more you know so  that's there is some limitations with it  it's still available you can find it but  with chat GPT man it's so easy  so there was this other thing that I  checked on because I was trying to find  out well how much would it cost you know  like because they are going to  eventually try to make money off of it  because right now five or one million  people have used it since since Monday  by Monday  a million people so now at least five  million people have used it right so in  order to do this it's burning up through  servers luckily this is funded of course  by Elon Musk as well as connection with  Microsoft but they did some calculation  that it cost about four cents for every  single entry that gets done right so  every prompt four cents  that's right I thought that was for  conversation yeah so so I mean the thing  is it could be relatively cheap and  think about hey if you were to offer  this and just make it like a simple app  on your phone where oh yeah subscription  costs you five bucks uh a month I think  they'd be raking in the money especially  with students that want to be able to  quickly answer questions I think this is  going to be a gigantic Money Maker the  other thing that I wanted to quickly add  is so a question was asked to Google  because they had an open call here  recently saying hey are you worried  about chat GPT competing with you  because some people are saying that this  is the new Google right because I can  ask it anything so Google responded with  something very interesting they said no  we're not worried we have multiple AIS  that can do exactly what chat GPT can do  right now right the reason that they  haven't released anything is because  they're very much worried as far as  their image because there are some  issues with chat GPT and giving slightly  false information so they want to make  sure to iron that out a bit more to  limit liability before they start to  release things just like this the future  is very wide open for them there's an  interesting Chrome plug-in I've been  using  um which uh basically accesses chat GPT  and adds it to your Google results in  parallel to Google results it's very  interesting to just to run that and to  compare how they work uh friends we have  a another person who wants to join us  this is a wonderful writer John Warner  and we bring him up on stage and see if  we can find him on the screen I think  this is the maximum we've ever done it  one time so hold on  hello John good afternoon hello to  everybody good to see you sir good to  see you where are you today  I'm at home in uh Charleston South  Carolina area all right all right well  stay warm  um  what do you what do you think about this  now you've written a whole series of  good articles and a bunch of tweet  storms um called you've called uh uh  Chachi PT uh a tool that lays bare the  paucity of a lot of writing instructions  especially in K-12 uh where where do you  stand now is is this the apocalypse or  is this actually a good step in progress  no I  I've seen it from the beginning as an  opportunity to re-examine the values we  attach to the things we ask students to  do in school context as the discussion  has been  about so far  um  you know I am uh I'm not in the academy  so some of the concerns of folks in here  are are very different than mine  um  you know as I listen I think there's a  number of different things we're talking  about here we're talking about using AI  as a skill that students should have and  be able to do which is absolutely a fact  right we we should be doing this we are  talking about using writing as a tool of  assessment in order to demonstrate  learning  as a kind of certification  um feature of Education  um  we are  talking about well and where my focus is  as somebody as a teacher of writing  right and somebody who's primarily  concerned with teaching students to  write  um one of the things I don't want us to  lose sight of is a couple things one is  particularly when we we start thinking  about the academic dishonesty angle if  you give students something worth doing  they will do it  the challenge we've given ourselves in  uh K-12 and higher ed is much of the  stuff we ask students to do doesn't seem  worth doing or the shortcut to the grade  is more desirable rather than the long  trip through learning and  chechi PT you know exposes some of the  kind of rote  assessments you might have in an English  or history class in K-12 or even even  college for that matter  as an empty exercise in assembling  syntax as opposed to a work of thinking  and Analysis which is what we think  we're asking them to do when we assign  these things  um it should kill things like the  admissions essays to colleges which the  chat gbt can turn out in infinite  numbers uh almost instantly and and  personalizing we were you were talking  about how you can get it to personalize  you can say like yeah I I only have one  parent or I come from this background or  I had cancer when I was a child and  it'll do that with absolute facility  with perfect syntax that will check the  box of admissions offices  but one of the things that that um so  what I come down to and I think all  those things are important and they  should all be talked about and they  should be talked about at the level of  values which for me is what do we want  students to learn and why do we want  them to learn that as opposed to why do  we want them to prove a sort of fidelity  to  um what I lectured about or what we  think is important to this sort of stuff  is to not miss the aspect of  using writing to learn  um one of my mantras that I use in in  all my books and talks and all that kind  of stuff is writing is thinking writing  is both the expression of an idea and  the exploration of an idea the act of  writing  causes the writer to process the  material  both consciously and subconsciously and  I swear to God even sometimes  unconsciously stuff will come to me I  have no idea where it came from I didn't  even know I knew it  and it rises up and it winds up on the  page  and that is the kind of  um ability that makes us human that is  the kind of activity that makes us human  that's the kind of experience that makes  us human and while I am like everybody  else messing around with uh  chat GPT like how can I get all this  stuff I have to do that I don't want to  do to do it for me and it does an okay  job  um but ultimately what I realized when I  was trying to experiment with it it's  actually me denying myself an important  part of my own thinking process about  the stuff that I'm involved in  um it is a great shortcut to content  um to to a product uh it may be a  shortcut I asked it I  um I still occasionally write humor  pieces for my old employer mcsweeney's  and I uh I gave it a prompt to to write  a a speech  um by Jordan Peterson explaining the  importance of stuffing live weasels down  your pants  and  um it gave me a um it gave me like a  decent start and it gave me a little bit  of  um a little bit of primer around the the  way he speaks and his rhythms and his  word choice  um but ultimately I tried to prompt it  with three or four other additive  elements and it didn't help at all it  was really like okay I need to take this  and I put it to one side and I open my  uh word processing program and I just  started typing my own thing it was it  was generative  But ultimately in the final version 10  15 of its language wound up but so it  became a kind of brainstorming tool not  a great writing tool for something that  actually does ultimately require a kind  of inspiration or intuition and that  kind of stuff  um so I just like to remind people that  like writing is yes it's a skill that we  demonstrate through making products but  it's also at a living  um experience that at least for me is  part of what reminds me that I'm human  it helps me process the world and chat  GPT cannot do that it's purely a syntax  machine it's a syntax generation  um  matching machine so when it can do well  on our prompts  sometimes I think we want to think about  our prompts but also I think we want to  think about the process what are we  valuing  when we assign that and how can if if we  still value that prompt what can we  assess that will  um make a put a sort of broader wrap our  arms around a broader part of the  student's experience in creating that  artifact John sounds like a kind of  decamiliarization of writing you know  making us rethink what we do with  writing in class especially in high  school  yeah I mean the the tragedy of what  we've done in writing sort of like  eighth grade on although now it's even  in grade school is really I I mean it's  really bad  um you know and I've been shouting about  this stuff for  for quite a long time now and uh why  they can't write came out uh over four  years ago at this point  um and now chat GPT I I can't tell you  how many emails and calls and stuff I've  gotten we're awesome people like oh yeah  this is a problem  simply because a machine can do it and  they're worried about cheating and  assessment and this kind of stuff but it  was always a problem and the problem was  it made students uh not practice  thinking through writing it made them  primarily my biggest worry as a writing  teacher it made them hate writing  particularly in school contexts and  they're utterly uninterested in a course  that was never like their favorite first  year writing is never going to be  anybody that can't wait to take that but  they were actively repelled by their  first year writing course which is the  the terrible outcome friends I'm  conscious of time I'm also conscious of  the fact that  um this is a mantle right now  um and I'm going to try and clear the  decks a bit and uh and uh go for some  greater gender representation I'm Gonna  Knock a couple of you a couple of you  off right now but I can bring bring you  back up but hang on just a second and  I'll make some room for this  um and let me first of all welcome Dr  Jess Stahl who is coming to us from the  Northwest Commission on colleges and uh  hello hello Jess  hello thank you so much yes so I'm  affiliated with the Northwest Commission  on colleges and universities which is an  Institutional accreditor so thank you  for adding me to the panel here I think  I'd just like to jump in and say that  really chat GPT isn't giving us any new  information about the need that we need  to modernize higher education but it is  probably taking away the delusion that  those changes are still optional uh or  that they could occur over a longer  timeline than maybe one to two years  so I think we've seen this Evolution  from the idea of a sage on the stage to  then being a guide on the side and I  would say that Chachi PT is a fantastic  guide on the side so that's probably  once again out and so I think where we  are now is more needing to focus on  building strong relationships like  mentoring relationships professional  relationship with Learners and providing  them with access to valuable networks  valuable resources that they can access  only within academic institutions so  what that looks like will probably be  different for all of the different  institutions but I would encourage all  institutions to be really thinking about  where the value in higher education lies  at this point I think this is really  kind of holding up a mirror to that but  there's value in higher ed for the  institution because they charge tuition  so there's a financial value there's a  value for faculty and staff because  they're paid by those institutions so  they've got that Financial value what is  the value being provided to students  because that's actually now the the  currency of the realm for higher  education moving forward  Jess that's a that's a fantastic Point  um I I'm you know you're coming from an  accredited agency um  what um as an accreditor I mean how do  you think this is this might play out  over the next few years I mean we'll be  in that sense of urgency will you see  that will you try to help value more  Innovation uh more highly or will uh  will you actually look for people for  institutions who are implementing social  response to chat gbt and curricula or in  pedagogy  so I think that accreditors are always  looking for Innovation and in particular  we're looking for Innovation that  eliminates Equity gaps  um and in student achievement and  outcomes for all students so I think  that will continue to be a focus I think  the tools like chat gbt do have some  limitations in that area they exhibit  the bias that is inherent in our  societies because the data that they're  trained on is us right so whatever is  present in society is going to be  present Within These tools it looks like  open AI has tried to build in some  filtering and sort of some guardrails  and and guidelines so that they could  minimize some of the some of those  effects but I think that there are  clever ways that you can prompt this  tool that many people have demonstrated  already online where you can still kind  of get around that you could you could  for example get Chachi BT to express  racism or tell you things that it that  it shouldn't tell you and you can see  where openai has even sort of tried to  build in some guardrails around that if  you ask those questions directly it  won't answer them or we'll kind of go  around them or tell you it can't answer  that type of question but for example if  you were to tell it to tell you a story  about a person who had certain traits or  to answer me in an aggressive style that  it would do that right so so there are  you know ways that it can be manipulated  so I think that accreditors will always  be really sensitive to how these tools  are being used for education and you  know how is Ed Tech showing up you know  in the curriculum and how that's  utilized  um and I think that certainly  eliminating Equity gapses is is always  going to be at the heart of  accreditation  ah thank you thank you Jessica that's  that's a great answer I know you're on  the spot and this is something which is  happening much faster than accreditation  does  um but that gives us a great preview of  what to look for yeah our University is  actually going through accreditation  right now so we started to do self-study  and then we're going to have visitors uh  coming here later this year or later  next year  um and that's one of the big things that  we're trying to push is to see what's  going to happen within the next few  years how do we need to change the  skills that we're teaching students so  that when they graduate they'll be that  much more successful and I think being  able to use tools like you know chat GPT  or just AI in general that's the big  push now is AI literacy and the problem  that I keep running into as I try to  push right is  our students they're already using AI  like that's happening that's already  that's been happening for a couple years  already so if the faculty doesn't have  proper AI literacy they're never going  to be able to address this with a  student so it can't be this thing of  because I've been reviewing sort of the  academic Integrity policies right we  can't just make a block blanket  statement of saying no you can't use AI  because that's that would be completely  self-defeating in fact you know  grammarly is AI  right of course we're not going to say  you can't use grammarly you can't use  word Word Microsoft Word has built-in AI  more and more things will have these  components built in we have to  understand how to properly use them and  then properly motivate the students to  go through it in the proper way so  they're not doing academic dishonesty  and they're actually learning the  process having the fundamentals so that  they can then use these in the proper  way so it's not a crutch but it's an  additional tool to be able to do more  Brent I understand that's that's what  you would like to see  um and I agree personally I'm just  thinking that we should also expect to  see people trying to block this  we saw this for a long time with  Wikipedia and we still do you know  attempts to block Wi-Fi from classrooms  for example used to happen I could  imagine calls for this occurring at the  Enterprise level  um but I I I wanted to make sure we had  room for everyone's questions and uh and  fenzi coming to her from the University  of Maine want to join us so let's bring  in on us up on stage  hello and greetings hello  um yeah and and thanks with my my uh  question and comment really kind of fits  in with what Jess and Ander were just  saying about let's let's focus on the  students not let's not look at this from  The Faculty perspective of oh no what do  I do about this but  how does this help the students instead  of how is this harming the students and  so my my plan right away is to is to  have my students try this out and say  what can you do with it see if you can  figure out its limitations see if you  can figure out its strengths and then  let's think about well  okay what is it not doing really well  what is it doing really well and how  could it help you as a learner and you  know just as I've been kind of playing  around and having conversations with it  you know I'm kind of learning you know  about how I would use it and how I  wouldn't use it and I I think I think  it's important to not forget the Learner  in all of this  absolutely and what do you uh what do  you teach in or what are you studying uh  I did teach educational technology  perfect perfect  excellent  it seems like we have a lot of  pedagogical approaches that we've  discussed so far from uh rethinking  student work to give students something  worth doing uh to have chat generate  stuff for students to discuss to use uh  chat gbt for feedback to assign deeply  personal pieces to turn to oral  assignments or oral assessments and to  teach AI literacy these are whole stereo  is there anything else that instructors  should be thinking about doing at the  classroom level  okay the the only thing I'd like to to  add here is John I thought you you gave  a great thing as far as helping helping  us think about it as far as what is  someone losing when they don't write  things out right because having worked  with a lot of different students man I  have so many students and we've seen  this trend line going like this  constantly going up here with our  undergraduate students and working right  now we're seeing lots of undergraduate  students that are working full-time  full-time and still going for College  full-time so that's a major problem so  the number one thing on their mind of  course they want to get that degree  which they shouldn't be thinking that  they should be thinking I want to get an  education but they're thinking I want  that degree and they're trying to think  what can I do to save myself time that's  the main thing that's leading everything  unfortunately right  thing on learning this so every every  single thing they're going to be trying  to use whatever mechanism whatever tool  is out there to save them time chat GPT  is going to be a major factors one of  one of the uh  main points I make and why they can't  write which I intended to be a book of  writing pedagogy but soon became a book  there were over half of it was an  analysis of the systems in which student  writing happens  is that the the greatest constraint when  it comes to helping students learn to  write is not that we don't know how to  teach them  it's not that students don't want to  write it's not the effort it's not that  stuff it's it's purely one of resources  time  um and what you're speaking to there is  student time right the the amount of  time they have available to dedicate to  their studies but also instructor time  um if if uh one thing we know about  teaching writing is that one-on-one  attention  Works  um if you ever if Google  um John McPhee uh and learning to write  yes and you'll come up with a half a  dozen essays by its former students  about how he taught writing which is  basically a one-on-one tutorial now we  maybe can't achieve that  but if um  if you give me a maximum of 45 students  in the semester three sections of 15. I  will have them on a trajectory to  becoming self-regulating writers no  problem  I never had those conditions in the  entirety of my career the few students I  ever had was 65 United semesters of over  180 students so when you cannot do the  work that we know works there's not a  lot we can do about it it's not  necessarily that we don't know what to  do about these things it's that that we  are so resource constrained around  reacting to them that it becomes a bit  of a  you know a bit of a whack-a-mole around  this is where the the part of my French  the cop [ __ ] comes in where we start  policing student behavior and we start  blocking them off from websites and we  say don't use Wikipedia and put a spy  cam on their laptops  um because we can't actually have a  relationship with them  either we choose that and resource it or  we go down the the big black spiral hole  to the bottom I I hope we don't do that  and you know what you're saying John is  is being echoed in the chat too about a  lot of people talking about  individualizing instruction and who has  time for that and what how could chat  GPT be used as an extra set of hands in  the classroom to you know provide some  of that one-on-one assistance to  students and you know uh Karen mentioned  too about you know  neurodiverse individuals how this might  be a tool to help them and you know my  my uh population that I teach are non  traditional Learners and you know Brent  you mentioned people who are working  full-time and this is exactly what I  plan to do with them is to help them  figure out how does this tool help you  not to save time so much but how to help  you learn better because you know as  John said the goal of of your degree is  not just to get the degree the goal is  to actually learn yeah yeah what I would  say to faculty and and here I certainly  don't represent an accrediting agency  but just really just myself as a person  but what I what I would say to faculty  is that most of what you do probably in  your day-to-day is really emerging as  not that valuable oh probably almost all  of it will need to change and in fact  your your role is going to be strongly  questioned so if you're looking at what  you should be doing differently in your  role I think really at the end of the  day you're looking at answering the  question what can you do better than the  most advanced technology and it won't be  imparting facts and it won't be  presenting curriculum and it won't be  evaluating learning and it won't be  preventing cheating and all those things  it's not going to be that what it is  going to be is how human and important  and valuable can you make your  relationships with the Learners so that  you are doing that skill better than an  advanced technology like chat GPT that  can mimic a very fake relationship it  could mimic and people will  anthropomorphize this technology so they  will feel a relationship to it because  when you ask it to answer in the style  of someone you're actually asking it to  take on a personality and it does that  and when you say write me a story about  somebody in the very specific details  you're actually asking it to do what we  would call empathizing taking on the  perspective of another and it actually  does that really well and it actually  reflects and expresses that back really  well possibly better than many people do  so it's really going to be the strength  of your relational interpersonal skills  with Learners that you're going to have  the human advantage and right now if  your relationships are not genuine  meaningful deep and helpful to students  then that's you know you're not going to  be able to compete in that Arena either  and that's one of the few human things  that you'll have left us really like  this Advantage so that would be my  advice to faculty is to think about how  you're building those relationships and  then for institutions I would say what  type of human social networks that are  very rewarding and professional networks  are very rewarding that you're providing  for students and what kind of resources  do you have at your campus or in your  online  programs that Learners couldn't access  elsewhere because there are sort of  these economies of scale and things that  you can provide at the scale of a  learning institution that they couldn't  get elsewhere and that also is valuable  just so you know Jess you have a big fan  club in the chat  um and uh uh and I'm including me  um that was an incredible incredible  response uh however I just have to put  up one problem it is 257 eastern time  that means we have only three minutes  left of our session together so let me  put to you two questions first  can we continue this topic in a  following session either next Thursday  or the Thursday after  um please in the in the chat let me know  and the four of you on stage would that  be good do you think sure that'd be  fantastic and the second question is I'm  not ending things just just hang on a  second uh there are 22 questions in our  list right now that we haven't had a  chance to get to uh those who put them  forward can I copy and post them to the  blog again uh without you know  anonymizing them without you just let me  know in the chat or direct message me  um because uh these are great  um I'm just I'm just wild how far we've  come in just about 52 minutes  um  just let me just ask John and uh Brent  and especially Ann and any responses to  just throwing down the gauntlet  um we have to repaint everything in  higher ed because a lot of it isn't  going to be useful anymore yeah no I I  want to Echo some of that because one of  the things that I say here at this  University and again I get a lot of  faces right is what I tell my students  is hey there is no information you don't  need information from me on how to do  this if there's millions of YouTube  videos there's millions of web pages  that tell you how to do it so you don't  need me for that all I'm here to do is  to answer questions or to make it more  relevant right to make it that's part of  my my aspect of what I'm doing is I'm  trying to motivate you and in motivating  you by giving you the relevancy I'm  helping you to understand I'm giving you  an opportunity to use those skills to  actually have Satisfaction by seeing  that oh I'm gaining the skill and I can  use it and I can express it and I'm  becoming that much more effective and  capable for when I move on from the  University right so I totally believe  that I totally agree that we're there to  help clarify to answer questions to  motivate to give them an opportunity to  use that skill again that relationship  aspect I think is is right on for sure  what Jess was was saying too about  breaking what's happening in higher ed  because  who was higher ed designed for  and the systems that we have now work  for those people only and if we really  want to make higher ed more Equitable we  have to break down what what we're doing  and  really make the best use of of what  faculty are there for  I've been uh echoing everything else  I've been ready for this for literally  years I've been mystified because I'm  not a real academic and I've never sort  of been inculcated into the system I've  been mystified why more of higher  education is not attuned to student  learning for the entirety of my time  intersecting with these institutions  it's about credentialing and signaling  and all those things that we're aware of  that the institutions also do  but I've been ready for it for a long  time and that's why I'm excited for the  appearance of this kind of Technology  because it forces us to confront these  things and talk about what we value and  um  look at the things that the areas where  we're constrained and hopefully start to  put resources into those Learners who  would benefit for more resources rather  than  um the continuing  um  constraints and limits we put on the  students who probably need the most help  in terms of accessing that learning  well said uh and that's a great moment  to end on I think  um just just the four of you Brent John  uh Jess and thank you for joining us um  on this rolling panel  um and uh and all the other panelists  and uh who have been on and also all the  great questions thank you so much this  has been an extraordinary session uh one  that I think has covered a lot of ground  and one that we haven't finished so I'm  going to uh see about redoing this or  resuming this next week or the week  after  um I will share everybody's  um uh comments on my blog post coming up  along with the uh entire uh recording  that'll be up shortly  um let me just uh quickly wrap this up  with um the points coming up for our our  next sessions if you'd like to continue  talking about this right now uh over the  next week please you know head to  Twitter  um where I am use the hashtag ftte or to  my blog brianalexander.org I'm going to  add a couple others to this list uh next  time if you'd like to look into our  previous sessions on pedagogy of writing  on on plagiarism and honesty on  technology in general just go to  tinyurl.com  fdfarchive we have sessions coming up  just go to  form.futureeducation.us to see those and  if any of you have projects that you'd  like to share including using chat GPT  please shoot me a note I'd be glad to  share them with this awesome Community  thank you all for a fantastic session my  mind is spinning this has been terrific  I love the way that we've brought our  Collective mind to bear on this  fast-moving and important subject  if I don't talk to you all for the next  few days have a great end of semester  have a great holiday if you're  celebrating have great down time in  general  um above all be safe and take care and  we'll see you next time online thanks  everybody  bye bye
