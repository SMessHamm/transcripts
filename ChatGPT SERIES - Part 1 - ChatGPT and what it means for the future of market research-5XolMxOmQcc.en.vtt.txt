 foreign  there's been a huge amount of um noise  and conversation this week about chat  gbt it seems like it's been everywhere  um on LinkedIn and Beyond I think it's  like the first or the quickest service  ever to get to a million users or  something like that so just be really  valuable if you could say a little bit  about maybe for the uninitiated what it  is  um and then you know what you think of  it seems pretty impressive from what  I've seen  yeah for sure it's definitely been  making its rounds on social media so  Chad gbt is the latest model released by  openai and it's actually not too  fundamentally different from some other  models that they've released previously  which also share the name GPT so GPT  stands for generative pre-trained  Transformer and that actually does  really tell you what it is so I'll just  break that apart the first part  generative refers to the type of  language model that it is so essentially  GPT has been trained on tons and tons of  texts and all that it's really doing at  a very low level is trying to figure out  based on some sort of prompt that it's  given what is the next text to generate  that would be sort of most plausible or  most likely based on all the text that  it has already seen  then the pre-trained part refers to the  fact that it's basically been trained on  tons and tons of data so it's seen uh  really almost incomprehensible amount of  data across the internet and then  finally the the T the Transformer refers  to the specific neural architecture that  it's using so I won't go into too many  technical details here but essentially  this is sort of uh one of the more  Innovative advancements in the last few  years and so taking these three things  together you basically have a model  that's been trained on so much data with  a large capacity for representation such  that it's able to generate texts which  just sound imminently plausible based on  other human generated texts from the  internet and then what this means that's  sort of a more emergent level is that  GPT and let's say chat GPT in particular  is able to do a very good job of let's  say improvisation so essentially it's  able to take on roles really really well  so if for example if you tell it that  it's you could give it some sort of  personality and say this is your  personality and then what are you gonna  what are you gonna say then GPT is very  very good at adapting so even if it's  going to make things up they might not  be truthful and so that that's one of  the big concerns it's very good at  pretending and it's also very good at  repeating plausible things that it's  memorized perhaps in the past that are  relevant to whatever kind of prompt that  you've given it and so essentially we  can think of it as just a model that's  really good at generating text based on  some sort of role or Persona that it's  adopting based on the prompt that you're  giving it thanks Josh  um so I guess kind of turning  specifically to to our world of the  market research I've seen a couple of  posts this week speculating that GPT and  GPT could have big implications for for  the market research and I mean just to  know what your thoughts are  yeah for sure so I think uh  conversational AI has been talked about  for a while within the context of market  research now but until now or until  recently the AI capabilities just  weren't really there I think so more  than anything else Chad GPT shows really  the capacity for what conversational AI  can do and I think a lot of people are  sort of already in the mindset that  conversational AI is the future of  market research but now we really have  strong evidence and the actual  technology to show that the sort of the  future is here so if nothing else chat  GPT kind of exemplifies the quality of  conversations that AI can have but  there's a lot more to be done you know  the the types of personas that chat GPT  might take on might be useful in some  situations but it's like any other human  you know you can have someone that knows  how to ask questions within a  conversation but Market researchers go  through years and years of professional  training in order to be able to ask the  right questions so getting to the point  where we can actually use the technology  like chat GPT to make sure that it's  asking questions that are appropriate  that aren't leading that's really where  sort of the next level of innovation  comes in
