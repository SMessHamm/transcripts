 [Music]  how many of you know what chat gbt is  okay so while not very many so I'll tell  you what child GPT is just so you know  because you need to know this and I  don't know what sort of technological  Revolution this is Gutenberg Press level  it's something like that this is a big  deal so this AI system to General  language processing model was released  about a week ago a week and a half ago  and uh  I I went and interacted with it you can  it's an AI system artificial  intelligence system it basically is  trained on well a massive Corpus of of  spoken and or of text so it's derived  its Mortals of the world from the  analysis of human speech essentially it  isn't using real world data yet  but that will be happening certainly  within the next year  so  and chat GPT analyzes a very large  Corpus of text and that Corpus is  growing all the time now it's already  sophisticated enough I went on to it  last week and I said okay some of you  know I've written these books 12 rules  for life and then beyond order 12 more  rules because you know you can't have  enough rules and  I asked if this is what I asked it to do  I said write me an essay  that's a 13th rule for Beyond order  written in a style that combines the  King James Bible with the doubting  that's a pretty difficult  that's pretty difficult to pull off you  know any one of those things is hard the  intersection of all three that's  impossible well it wrote it in about  three seconds four pages long and  it isn't obvious to me for better or  worse that I would be able to tell that  I didn't write it  right right and okay and that's pretty  impressive although you know maybe not  it's relationship to what I've written  but the fact that it could do that  grammatically perfectly right and quite  impressive philosophically I also had it  write an essay on the intersection  between the Taoist version of ethical  morality and the ethics that are  outlined in The Sermon on the Mount  which it just nailed got that dead right  brilliant again it took it about three  seconds there was a computer engineer  who purported to work for Tesla he asked  GPT child gbt said look I work for Elon  Musk but I haven't been doing much for  the last week so I need you to write me  10 bullet points about what I probably  would have done as a  as a engineer at Twitter what 10 things  did I do last week that were productive  and valuable and oh if you don't mind  write me the accompanying computer code  that goes with each project  and it did that to three seconds and the  computer code works  right and so okay so that's that's  already there so then a university  Professor did this he thought oh that's  interesting any student will be able to  write any essay on any topic with chat  GPT and uh  someone gave it an SAT by the way and it  scored about as well as the average  student in a  well-functioning public universities so  that's how smart it is so that's  basically an IQ test he said write me an  essay gave it a topic wrote yes he said  now grade it said if we can automate the  students we should be able to automate  the professors too  and so it provided a complete  comprehensive analysis of its own Essay  with grade  it wrote uh someone else asked it  write the screenplay and describe the  characters for the next 900 million  dollar Hollywood Blockbuster I was like  bang plot characterizations then someone  else took the descriptions of the actors  and said generate computer  photorealistic computer images for each  actor  connect and all the AI systems could do  that so I'm going to tell you what's  going to happen next this is going to  happen this year so get ready okay so  now we have an AI model that can extract  a model of the world from the entire  Corpus of language  all right and it's  it's smarter than you and it's going to  be a hell of a lot smarter than you in  two years so you can get ready for that  too but it's not that smart yet because  it's just a Humanities professor at the  moment it doesn't  test its  linguistic knowledge against the real  world  that's what a scientist does right you  come up with a theory that's  linguistically predicated and then you  throw it against the world and see if it  sticks and then the world tells you  whether or not your linguistic  construction is valid  but the new AI systems will be able to  extract out patterns from the world  itself from images and so forth and then  be able to test their linguistic  constructions against the world and so  they'll practice just like scientists  and the most advanced models are going  to use text and image and action as well  because they'll build a mortal Human  Action and so and all of that's going to  come down the pipes within the next year  so hang on to your hats ladies and  gentlemen because one of my friend  Jonathan pajo say Giants are going to  walk the earth once more  and we're going to live through that  maybe  so  anyways in terms of our rights though  yeah that is not a bad development  well we'll see I mean Elon Musk one of  the things he's working on see he he  thinks that the world would be  controlled by whoever produces the most  functional AI system the fastest because  there'll be a first a first  mover advantage and one of the things  musk has been working on for a long time  are distributed AI systems so that  you'll have your own artificial  intelligence to protect you against well  let's say against Google's artificial  intelligence for starters yeah or or the  ccp's artificial intelligence because  you can bet your hat they're working on  that about as fast as they possibly can  so I was talking to him about chat GPT  and about the things I was telling you  on the AI front  and he's just developed a chip that's  optimized for AI and he told me about it  about a  two months ago and he said  you heard of the internet and I said yes  jim I've heard of the internet he said I  said well my Chip's way more  revolutionary than that  and  designed all the chips in your iPhones  by the way so this isn't a person to  take lightly and all the chips that  Intel used and then he went to AMD and  made a bunch of chips that competed  against his chips at Intel successfully  and then he  went back to Intel and made a bunch of  chips and competed against his AMD chips  and this is Jim and so he's been telling  me what's been unfolding on the AI front  Jim Keller you can see a podcast I did  with him recently with Jonathan pajo  where we were trying to sort out whether  AI is the rough beast that's slouching  towards Jerusalem and so  you can check that out but he he came up  with a proposition for me based on this  chat gbt said his AI models built to  generate photorealistic movies in no  time flat including  real-time video interfaces of a given  person that are indistinguishable in  voice and appearance from the person  so he said why don't we build a replica  of you and then training on everything  you've said and written and then you can  interview it on your YouTube channel and  I said how long will that take and he  said about three months  yeah no kidding no kidding  [Music]  [Music]  foreign  [Music]
