 can you all believe this chat GPT I am  blown away by what it can do and I have  been feeding at different essay prompts  over the last week to see what it can  come up with and one of the essay  prompts I gave it and I thought it might  be interesting to all of you was write  me an essay on what the future holds for  Apple's video editing software Final Cut  Pro so right away chat GPT is kicking  off with a killer introductory paragraph  Apple's Final Cut Pro is a professional  grade video editing software that is  widely used in the film and television  industry  it has a long history of innovation and  has consistently been at the Forefront  of video editing technology there are  certainly features of Final Cut Pro that  are at the Forefront the Revolutionary  magnetic timeline does away with all the  restrictions of track based timelines  and others that are lagging way behind  and of course the amazing new touch bar  and that is a whole other discussion but  let's let's keep listening to chat GPT  and artificial intelligence and see what  it thinks in recent years Apple has made  significant updates to Final Cut Pro  including the introduction of new  features such as support for high  dynamic range and 360 degree video  editing FairPoint AI that is true those  updates have come to Final Cut Pro so  you are correct there whether or not  they're significant I don't know but uh  you know we're good so far so let's get  into what chat GPT thinks the future is  going to hold for Final Cut Pro it is  likely that Apple will continue to  develop and improve Final Cut Pro  you know some I think would argue that  Final Cut Pro is on its way out that it  is going to be dropped from Apple's  lineup like aperture was back in the day  and some that think that Final Cut Pro  were just waiting for that version 10.7  or version 11 to have the Apple Gods  shine upon us and give us all the  features we've been asking for for the  last 10 years Apple's going to  incorporate new technologies and  capabilities as they become available  well I don't necessarily want them to  incorporate new technologies as they  become available I want Apple to think  this stuff up I want them to create the  new technologies and to show us things  that video editing software can do that  nobody has thought of like the magnetic  timeline one possible direction for the  software is the incorporation of  artificial intelligence artificial  intelligence suggesting the  incorporation of artificial intelligence  you've got to be kidding me and machine  learning Technologies now machine  learning is something I've talked about  in my live streams and in my videos  about Final Cut Pro over and over again  hoping for features like everything from  background removal to Auto masking to  subtitle generation to logging your  footage sort of automatically  identifying people in the shot by their  faces how many people are in the shot is  already a feature in Final Cut Pro  whether it's a medium shot a close-up or  a wide shot so there's already some  elements of machine learning but we  really want Apple to push the bounds and  chat GPT are artificially intelligent  essay writer feels the same way these  Technologies could be used to automate  certain tasks automate being a big part  of my workflow trying to use these  different editing consoles and things to  streamline and make more efficient the  editing process or to assist editors in  their work by suggesting edits and  offering recommendations so that's  interesting because now you're not just  talking about Ai and machine learning  being a tool to help you prep to edit to  do your thing as a human being the magic  of actually putting shots together to  tell a story this is saying that  artificial intelligence and machine  learning could suggest those edits for  you and with machine learning writing an  essay on the future of Final Cut Pro I  don't think that we're terribly far off  from machine learning starting to edit  scenes an entire short films we've seen  you know lots of stuff on Twitter and  social media about AI writing  screenplays and usually they're pretty  bad but you know there's something  interesting about what it's doing and  where it could go this technology is  very early stages right now moving on  another area of potential growth for  Final Cut Pro is in its integration with  other Apple products and services apple  has a strong ecosystem of devices and  software and it is likely that the  company will continue to explore ways to  seamlessly integrate Final Cut Pro with  other tools such as the iCloud storage  service or the apple pencil for iPad  kind of took a little bit of a left turn  there with the apple pencil for iPad I  think you know the heart of what's there  is that Final Cut Pro could end up being  on the iPad we saw that DaVinci Resolve  was put on the iPad so I don't think  that it's far off I just thought it was  funny that it's calling out specifically  the apple pencil now one thing that is  interesting know is the use of iCloud  storage something we've all been  clamoring for is Apple to come up with  some kind of collaborative creative  workflow for Final Cut Pro and what  better service to use than iCloud to  store Final Cut libraries that can be  used back and forth between remote  editors I'm looking to partner with an  editor here in Omaha but she wants to  work at her home and I want to work at  my home and I would love to be able to  put a Final Cut Pro Library into  something iCloud related we could both  access that library at the same time  looking at or working on edits very  similar to how you can with Avid media  composer but it's certainly something  that all those other nles are moving  toward and apple we're still standing  here going when's it our turn for Final  Cut Pro so I think that that is another  aspect of the future of Final Cut Pro  that I am excited about and I think AI  is right in talking about how iCloud can  be integrated into the future of Final  Cut Pro in addition to these  technological advancements it is also  possible that Apple will continue to  expand the reach of Final Cut Pro by  making it available on more platform now  this is where things in my opinion  completely go off the rails you have  derailed shut up Richard currently the  software is only available for Mac  computers but it is possible that Apple  could make it available for other  operating systems in the future such as  Windows or Linux this would allow even  more users to access the powerful video  editing capabilities of Final Cut Pro  here's what I think about that that is  some BS you are way off chat GPT that is  not going to happen I am saying it here  right now definitively I am talking in  absolutes only assist deals in absolutes  there is no way that Apple will ever put  Final Cut Pro on a Windows machine or a  Linux machine it's just not gonna happen  period end of story no chance so these  are the three main points that chat GPT  is saying speaking very much in  generalities as to the future of Final  Cut Pro not diving in very specifically  on what we have in store for Final Cut  Pro as things develop with apple over  the years jet gbt concludes with saying  overall the future looks bright for  Apple's Final Cut Pro I think there's a  lot of us out there that would argue  against that I'm sort of in the middle  some days it's bright some days it feels  a little bit dark to me with a strong  history of innovation and commitment to  stay at the Forefront of video editing  technology it is likely that the  software will continue to evolve and  improve in the coming years as new  technologies and capabilities become  available Apple will no doubt explore  ways to incorporate them into Final Cut  probe further enhancing its capabilities  and making it even more valuable to  users first off are you kidding me with  chat GPT I mean I know that I couldn't  really use this as like a script for a  video on my channel because it's just so  vague in in speaking very much on the  surface you know this is a five  paragraph essay which you know sort of  is the standard academic kind of thing  to do uh you know in middle school and  high school and whatnot but when we're  talking about something that's a little  bit more scholar early a little bit more  flexing their expertise muscles you know  this again touches on things that we all  have been thinking about but it doesn't  really go to that next level of depth  that really makes an essay about the  future of Final Cut Pro something that  we are moved by or intrigued by or  Sparks our curiosity or gets us going  yeah that could be the future of Final  Cut Pro again I love that it touches on  artificial intelligence and machine  learning something I've talked about a  lot I love that it talks about the  integration of iCloud into the Final Cut  Pro ecosystem of course it's way off  base I think by bringing Final Cut Pro  to other platforms but for the most part  I'm you know just shocked that I could  prompt it with this one statement and  within seconds it spits out this essay  chat GPT nicely done Bravo this was a  fun little exercise in seeing what you  might predict the future for Final Cut  Pro and again I think there's some some  things that are really interesting here  and some things that are just way off  the mark let me know what you think down  in the comments I'd love to hear what  you think the future holds for Final Cut  Pro and whether or not chat GPT and  artificial intelligence is going to play  a role in that if you like this video  about the future of Final Cut Pro then  you might like this older video that I  made about what is going on with Final  Cut Pro definitely check that one out  until the next video I'll see you all  soon and don't forget keep chopping that  broccoli  [Music]  oh  foreign
