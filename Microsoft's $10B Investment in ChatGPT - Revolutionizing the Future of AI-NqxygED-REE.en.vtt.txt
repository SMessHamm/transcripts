 Microsoft is in talks to invest 10  billion dollars in open AI the creator  of the artificial intelligence pop bot  chat GPT that's according to people  familiar with the plan chat GPT has  received worldwide attention since its  launch less than two months ago and  gained its first million users in less  than a week the Box ability to gather  information and imitates human  conversation has led to speculation it  could one day replace professional  writers and even threaten Google's  search engine where do you believe we're  going to see the next leg of disruption  as well as displacement I think the the  next phase if I had to sort of say if  you say mobile and Cloud was the last  Paradigm uh the next really is going to  be AI  um and that's kind of you know going to  happen in the next few I would say two  to three years is going to be as big  um you know it'll be more like I I take  it back to 2007 2008 who is when cloud  and mobile became bake I think we are in  that phase when it comes to AI I want to  emphasize that it's far beyond uh  answering questions or doing chat it is  an example of a neural network that is  actually uh working so  um we are in for a big set of surprises  yeah of course the most immediate issue  is the threat on replacing the sort of  standard Google search thing where you  get something and you get you know 20 30  different sites and they are proposing  something which is completely magical  just get the answer Microsoft is not  willing again to lose a next Revolution  Microsoft plans to invest 10 billion  dollars in open AI the startup Behind  Popular artificial intelligence tool  chat GPT  a bet on chat GPT could help Microsoft  boost its efforts in web search a market  dominated by Google  the company's Bing browser has only a  small share of the global search engine  Market however it is hoped the deal  could help the firm chip away at  Google's dominance by offering more  advanced search capabilities  Microsoft's recent decision is likely  driven by a few key factors this  particular technology is one out of 10  different engines that we have out there  I want to emphasize that it is far  beyond answering questions or doing chat  it is an example of a neural network  that is actually working so we are in  for a big set of surprises of course the  most immediate issue is the threat on  replacing the sort of standard Google  search thing where you get something and  you get you know 20 30 different sites  and they are proposing something which  is completely magical just get the  answer  advancements in AI gpt3 is one of the  most advanced language processing models  to date and has the ability to  understand natural language and generate  human-like text  Microsoft has been investing heavily in  Ai and machine learning and the  acquisition of gpt3 would allow them to  further Advance their capabilities in  this area  improved natural language processing  gpt3 can be used to improve natural  language processing which is becoming  increasingly important in a variety of  Industries  Microsoft could use gpt3 to improve its  chat Bots virtual assistants and other  products that rely on natural language  processing why this could be a once in a  decade once in perhaps a generation  investment opportunity for Microsoft  well if you think about where Google's  market cap comes from their 1.1 trillion  almost 60 percent of that comes from  their search business  so uh because that's because Google  search is so much better than Bing it's  10 times bigger business than Bing if  incorporating chat GPT into Bing makes  it competitive with Google search that's  the amount of market cap that Microsoft  could take away from Google in the order  of magnitude of 600 billion in the short  term Microsoft is benefiting greatly  because all this uh data and computing  power is going to its azure  Cloud hosting business and so it's it's  money that they're investing that's  coming right back to Microsoft to grow  its most important business to Azure  business so it's a great investment for  Microsoft in a product that could really  help it transform its two key products  increased competitiveness by acquiring  gpt3 Microsoft would be able to gain a  competitive advantage in the market for  AI powered products and services  this acquisition would give Microsoft  Access to gpt3's capabilities which  could be integrated into its own  products and services making them more  competitive in the marketplace  applications in multiple domains gpt3  can be used in a wide range of  applications including natural language  generation translation language-based  search and even in creative writing news  generation and text summarization  this diversity of usage allows Microsoft  to explore and develop various products  and services that can leverage gpt3  capabilities  developing a strong ecosystem by  integrating gpt3 into its existing  products and services Microsoft could  develop a strong ecosystem that would  attract developers partners and  customers to build and use AI powered  products  this can help Microsoft to strengthen  its position as a leader in the AI  market and Foster a community of  developers and customers that can help  to advance the state-of-the-art and AI  improving customer experiences gpt3's  ability to understand natural language  and generate human-like text can be used  to improve customer experiences  Microsoft could use gpt3 to create more  natural and human-like interactions in  chat Bots virtual assistants and other  customer facing products which could  ultimately lead to better customer  satisfaction I have already bet on open  AI because they've already invested the  billion dollars in open eye on the past  and they have an exclusive right and all  the service now is being done over azure  uh that is Microsoft Cloud  infrastructure so there is a tight  collaboration  the one example of search is again one  example and could be a winning example  which of course will hurt Google open AI  the creators of gpt3 have a history of  collaboration with Microsoft which may  have made the acquisition process easier  smoother and the goal of the acquisition  more aligned for both parties  it's worth noting that gpt3 is one of  the most advanced AI models in language  processing and it's likely that  Microsoft sees a significant potential  in integrating it into their products  and services which would provide them  with a Competitive Edge in the market  and open new possibilities for their  business in the future  foreign  [Music]
