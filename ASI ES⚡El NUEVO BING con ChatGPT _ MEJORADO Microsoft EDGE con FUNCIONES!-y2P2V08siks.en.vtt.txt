 [Music] how are you as always Welcome to a new video here at the computer dump we are going to highlight a little about the notes that I spoke yesterday in the main channel In reference to the new Microsoft integration with Bing ai  but we are going to talk a little more in depth, perhaps that video was not very relevant because people are unaware of the subject, but we are going to talk a little more to the point here. So we are going to take two important notes, well, there are practically not two notes, one is already  what we talked about yesterday another one is new we're going to start with the new Microsoft Edge and integration with already the new Bing guide is now available for the Ted channel So I recently talked about Microsoft Phoenix the code name of a  important evolution of the Microsoft browser, now that update is a reality and although partially what is good is not available to everyone, Microsoft already allows us to see and test all this in the Microsoft deck channel and to the main course of all this In reference to the design there is also the integration of the new Bin based on the gpt chat day this new Edge has been announced during the Microsoft event on Artificial Intelligence that took place  yesterday and where the new macrosd that is in everyone's mouth was presented, the first thing that stands out when opening the browser is its renewed design, the colors have been retouched, some icons have been reorganized and the most remarkable thing is that a new design has been applied to the tabs and as we see right now we will now have rounded floating tabs a style more similar to Firefox than Chrome and that fits better with the design lines of Windows 11 itself, also the scroll bars have been updated finally leaving those bars  fat rectangular ones and opting for other more rounded ones and also these that have been missing the mica effect that in fact was said that i  This new Edge is going to have it but it is native to Windows 11 But obviously it is trusted that Microsoft finds a way to implement it as soon as possible and another interesting novelty is the function of splitting windows which we will have to activate through a flash fact of  moment this for what is the channel of this feature allows us to see two web pages at the same time in the same window in a very comfortable way and minimizing distractions So we are going to emphasize that last and not least we have the integration with Bing  and through a clearly visible bim logo because it is now larger on the right side of the browser we will be able to access the functions of the new Pink chat based on the G chat technology it is not yet available I want to emphasize that although it is already true  I have the development channel Sorry I already have the Microsoft version on the deck channel it is not yet available for some regions of m  At the moment it is said that it will be available in the coming weeks and thanks to this function we will be able to interact with the bim guide without having to go to the search engine simply from the right sidebar the conversations with this AI allow us to break barriers and give it a  A twist in the way we search for everything on the Internet, so everything points to Artificial Intelligence being practically a topic that Microsoft is dealing with right now with products like Windows 11 and its derivatives. So, without a doubt, Google All this is still weighing now. In fact, we are going to highlight the following note because, well, we are going to finish this one off because it remembers Edge macros in the new integration with Bing day, it is available in the version of As I said, this version is the one that suffers  all sorts of changes that aren't on the stable channel may have some glitches but it's kind of ahead of you so we're going to highlight what The day before yesterday I talked about Google presenting a van that was another artificial intelligence that was going to convert it to gpt chat and Well, we must say that Bart made a serious mistake by answering a question wrong after its premiere and Google lost 100 billion in the stock market, although the Microsoft event took place, Google had presented its respective and already integrated into the search engines Well, we must say that he made a tremendous mistake that led him to lose 100 million dollars Sorry, it was 100 million dollars in the stock market Bart's presentation event that took place on Tuesday can be summed up with the word that it is unnecessary, one that they limited themselves to counting less than what was already counted in a press release from a few days ago and without anything new on top of all the errors that  had a controversy was involved because he did not answer a question correctly this error was spotted at first that was published in an article and as is practically  However, this was reduced to good, as such it had the consequence of a collapse in the stock market. So we can see the Graph because it was practically reduced by an impression of this already of 100,000 million dollars and all thanks to the influence of a tremendous error of this artificial intelligence So we see the tremendous graph a fall in the stock market the error that Google revealed is related to James Webb's space telescope And it is that in a promotional video you can see how the question is formulated what new discoveries James Webb's space telescope can tell my 9-year-old son and it is there that among the answers is the telescope that was used to take the first images of another exoplanet but this is not correct since the first exoplanet images were  taken in 2004 by the beyler telescope of the southern European observatory according to NASA, therefore there are still certain shades of terror since Bart is not in  It is wrong on a technical level, as a newspaper points out, the telescope took the first image of the planet outside our solar system, therefore it was wrong in this matter and it should be noted that although due to the confusion of Google, the tweet was not removed and  nor has it qualified the answers that bar has offered Obviously if there was a collapse in investments practically in the stock market So it is to emphasize that Microsoft is now stepping on the heels of Google So it is nothing I am going to say goodbye up to here highlighting a bit  more extensive this information that I did not summarize it yesterday But there we have it So that's up to here I say goodbye until next time Bye bye
