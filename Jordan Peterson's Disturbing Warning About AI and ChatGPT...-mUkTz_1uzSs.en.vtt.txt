 how many of you clap how many of you  know what chat gbt is  okay  so while not very many so I'll tell you  what Chow GPT is just so you know  because you need to know this and I  don't know what sort of technological  Revolution this is Gutenberg Press level  it's something like that this is a big  deal  so this AI system to General language  processing model was released about a  week ago a week and a half ago and uh I  I went and interacted with it you can  it's an AI system artificial  intelligence system it basically is  trained on well a massive Corpus of of  spoken and or of text so it's derived  its models of the world from the  analysis of human speech essentially it  isn't using real world data yet but that  will be happening certainly within the  next year  so  and chat GPT analyzes a very large  Corpus of text and that Corpus is  growing all the time  now it's already sophisticated enough I  went on to it last week and I said okay  some of you know I've written these  books 12 rules for life and then beyond  order 12 more rules because you know you  can't have enough rules and  I asked if this is what I asked it to do  I said write me an essay  that's a 13th rule for Beyond order  written in a style that combines the  King James Bible with the daote chain  that's a pretty difficult  that's pretty difficult to pull off you  know any one of those things is hard the  intersection of all three that's  impossible well it wrote it in about  three seconds four pages long and it  isn't obvious to me for better or worse  that I would be able to tell that I  didn't write it  right right and okay and that's pretty  impressive although you know maybe not  it's relationship to what I've written  but the fact that it could do that  grammatically perfectly right and quite  impressive philosophically I also had it  write an essay on the intersection  between the Taoist version of ethical  morality and the ethics that are  outlined in The Sermon on the Mount  which it just nailed got that dead right  brilliant again it took it about three  seconds there is a computer engineer who  purported to work for Tesla he asked GPT  child gbt said look I work for Elon Musk  but I haven't been doing much for the  last week so I need you to write me 10  bullet points about what I probably  would have done as a  as a engineer at Twitter what 10 things  did I do last week that were productive  and valuable and oh if you don't mind  write me the accompanying computer code  that goes with each project  and it did that to three seconds and the  computer code works  right and so okay so that's that's  already there so then a university  Professor did this he thought oh that's  interesting any student will be able to  write any essay on any topic with chat  gbt and uh  someone gave it an SAT by the way and it  scored about as well as the average  student in a  well-functioning public universities so  that's how smart it is so that's  basically an IQ test he said write me an  essay gave it a topic wrote the S he  said now grade it said if we can  automate the students we should be able  to automate the professors too  and so it provided a complete  comprehensive analysis of its own Essay  with grade  it wrote uh someone else asked it write  the screenplay and describe the  characters for the next 900 million  dollar Hollywood Blockbuster it's like  bang plot characterizations then someone  else took the descriptions of the actors  and said generate computer  photorealistic computer images for each  actor  connected and all the AI systems could  do that so I'm going to tell you what's  going to happen next this is going to  happen this year so get ready  okay so now we have an AI model that can  extract a model of the world from the  entire Corpus of language  all right and it's  it's smarter than you and it's going to  be a hell of a lot smarter than you in  two years so you can get ready for that  too but it's not that smart yet because  it's just a Humanities professor at the  moment it doesn't  test it's  linguistic knowledge against the real  world  that's what a scientist does right you  come up with a theory that's  linguistically predicated and then you  throw it against the world and see if it  sticks and then the world tells you  whether or not your linguistic  construction is valid  but the new AI systems will be able to  extract out patterns from the world  itself from images and so forth and then  be able to test their linguistic  constructions against the world and so  they'll practice just like scientists  and the most advanced models are going  to use text and image and action as well  because they'll build a mortal Human  Action and so and all of that's going to  come down the pipes  within the next year so hang on to your  hats ladies and gentlemen because one of  my friend Jonathan pajo say Giants are  going to walk the earth once more  and we're going to live through that  maybe
