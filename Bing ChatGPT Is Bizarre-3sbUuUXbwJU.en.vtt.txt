 lots to talk about today and a lot of it  has to do with AI stuff because AI is  taking over the news feed and eventually  the planet yeah and Microsoft and Google  are rushing to be the de facto standard  for all your AI needs  and obviously uh open AI chat GPT but  that's what I mean when I say Microsoft  Microsoft want to rush to actually show  you that hey we've got it in our  products ASAP they went to work they're  like oh this stuff is Wildfire take our  10 billies let us whip it into Bing  Revitalize Bing now I heard a lot of  different takes on this because they had  their event yesterday and they were kind  of  um you know showing off how they see you  using this and you had mixed feelings on  sort of The Branding around all of this  Bing itself it's kind of  you know it's a history it's a it's a  people have feelings about that brand  and  it  I'm not sure if the whole integration is  the best way to do it I know that  they've got the brand I know some people  use it I know it's really not  as bad as some people make it out to be  but it's just it wasn't necessarily the  dominating force in the space and  they're looking at Chachi PT and saying  hey well or open Ai and through an  integration can we have a leg up and can  we Revitalize this brand Bing  and that's a unique strategy I mean they  could have just they I know in the  interest of speed it probably made the  most sense to just throw this uh AI  assistant this text-based assistant this  chat bot straight into what they already  had because it's like well we've got  some people going there and whatnot but  I don't know part of me  imagines a pristine new start to the  whole thing where you think from the  ground up what a search engine might  look like if it was  oriented around  chat or dialogue it might be totally  different instead of having something  that's really formatted for the old  search style and probably Google's going  to do something similar and then instead  you kind of bolt on the conversational  aspect of  an AI based experience but anyway it's  in there now and as you can see there's  all types of uh marketing for it it's  taking up a huge percentage of the  screen real estate over there and it's  kind of showcasing what it can do to  sort of uh  I guess describing why you might want to  use it introducing the new Bing your AI  powered answer engine never mind search  engine there's a big button there to  join the wait list but I did obviously  watch some of the demos you gave it a  crack and you can see how it sort of  fills in the text in real time and how  in this case the uh suggestion sure I  can suggest a three course menu with a  chocolate dessert for your vegetarian  dinner party here are some possible  options  starter wild mushroom tart lives with  onions you see it's conversational but  it's also comprehensive  and that's what you get with chat TPT  that's what's been going on and now it  just lives in a place that might be  easier to access I do have some  questions around scaling it's been hard  enough to get Chachi PT going like via  open Ai and now we have it plugged in  here  how quickly can you implement Microsoft  money to make sure that the thing keeps  like can scale and probably that's the  reason you have this wait list going on  at the moment because it's it's going to  take time to deal with the volume  especially if there's a mass adoption of  this alternative way of searching and of  course Google's likely working on the on  the same thing so I don't know  listen  anytime you're dealing with a new  technology I think there's there's  probably well there's a couple of things  happening in tandem you're trying to be  first to Market you're trying to be fast  and so then you get your bolt-on aspect  but then at the same time you're you're  wanting to immediately let people know  that you're doing this thing so in a way  you kind of  uh  uh you kind of mess up the user  experience of the main search engine  because now it's like it's almost like  half and half the way you have this the  way you're zoomed in on this page it's a  huge portion and then it's a little  there could be a little confusion there  over like what do I want to do like I  have these two different Pathways to  take and  I just I'm a little bit conflicted on  whether it should be some completely  separate thing I agree I completely  agree I mean look at this there's so  many different branding uh elements here  that are completely different like the  button Styles the fonts the sizing  it's uh it's a UI nightmare it's a bit  of a nightmare now what's funny is the  idea of asking questions in a  conversational way is not like it's not  new to search you remember you used to  have  companies  do you remember Ask Jeeves will  like you used to have this idea and then  obviously you have uh other places you  ask questions online but you ask humans  like uh Cora and other places and  obviously forums Once Upon a Time like  it wasn't AI driven and it wasn't rapid  but the idea of asking questions is kind  of nice and conversational the  conversational web it's kind of nice  but the problem is how do you quickly  and easily explain that to people and  how do you have people want to engage  with it and not be confused I think  that's the challenge at the moment but I  know they want to be first to Market  they want to say hey  adopt our browser because we have this  thing integrated right now and I think  that this was more consequence of speed  than anything else I still think this is  a great opportunity for clippy to come  back  clippy they can be or it can be in a  little character over there in the side  yeah it could be like a chat bubble  listen man they're committed to this  they're committed to this big branding  and honestly I don't know in the long  term if the character thing makes any  sense because if you look what happened  assistant versus Siri and not to say I  mean the Technologies are obviously  different but I I think  people have some sort of AI apprehension  around personality once AI has  personality and if it does happen to be  really intelligent with personality  people get scared they're like stop  acting so much like a human all right  yeah somehow we seem to allow for a lot  more of it if it just has some sort of  generic title sure and then we're like  okay that's fine so listen I don't know  Space Odyssey screwed us all up made it  bad
