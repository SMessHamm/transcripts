 so Microsoft reportedly plans to invest  10 billion dollars a creator of a buzzy  AI tool chat gbt this is an NBC NBC news  story  um a uh startup behind the popular AI  tool Chad gbt as part of a funding  ground that would value open AI 29  billion dollars according to report the  deal would give Microsoft a 75 share of  open AI profits until it recoups its  investment after which the company would  assume a 49 stake on in open air damn  like 49 the reports states that the deal  has not been finalized yet and that the  plan was to close the deal by the end of  2022 open AI gbt is natural language  processing model which can generate next  that appears to be written by a human it  is widely used to be developing code and  writing essays this spent on chat gbt  may help Microsoft in its web search  efforts Tom Microsoft is a genius  um and you you look back Once Upon a  Time Apple was struggling and Steve Jobs  calls Bill Gates and says listen Apple's  going to go bankrupt but we need your  help uh we need and Gates came up with a  150 million dollars and it was on the  cover Time Magazine Steve Jobs on the  phone that says thank you Bill the world  is a better place because apple and  Microsoft can coexist Microsoft sold  that a couple years later for 550  million dollars had they held that until  Apple Peak last February you know if  that would have been worth  122 billion dollars if they would have  held it if they would have held it yeah  and by the way they thought they had  made Bank hey we gave Apple 150 we just  got 550 back half a billion Wahoo  Microsoft is really smart about this  stuff and you notice they're holding it  at 49 and by the way they've already  invested a billion in this they know  what they're doing  um and they're on top of it and they're  going to make money on this remember do  you remember something called Encarta  it's funny do you know what that is in  Carta and Carter was a CD it's like a  little DVD CD and it was an unbelievable  dictionary it was like four times the  content of the set of world book  encyclopedias if anybody remembers what  those were and  that was what Microsoft believed was  there it is  1995 was going was an information  resource for your computer and remember  Microsoft said you know this internet  thing is probably going to come and go  because they saw it like prodigy or AOL  so they were wrong about that since that  moment Microsoft has not been wrong  these guys are going to make money on  this and this is a really smart move and  you go back and look at what they did  with apple they're a king maker they  think open AI has what it takes to be a  trillion dollar company  I mean another trillion dollar company  do you think it has a shot of being a  trillion dollar company in 10 years  absolutely okay so that's a half a  billion dollar valuation added to  Microsoft yeah at least well I mean 449  is is you're talking about you mean half  a trillion half a trillion what did I  say and you said half half a billion  half a billion is nothing it's a half a  trillion dollars yeah this is another  500 not a trillion dollars yeah 500  billion dollars added to valuation  gotcha yeah that's another half a  billion on the Microsoft stock price I  am surprised others are not going in  this every once in a while you get some  kind of a company that comes along like  this that you can you're seeing the  results of what it's capable of doing  we're not talking about FTX you know  we're talking about you can sit there  you know what the biggest complaint is  yesterday I posted a video about what is  Chad gbt and who's behind it you know  what's the most common tweet I got back  from people here's the most common  response stop talking about Chad gbt I  use it daily and every time you guys  talk about it the website  [Laughter]  okay I want to watch that because here's  the question I have yeah generally  sometimes it's better to ask questions I  mean I don't know much about this why  are people using it because my  assumption at least initially is hey I'm  a 20 year old college kid time to write  that essay uh thanks chat gbt so why why  are people using like what are they  using it for I'm not doubting why  someone would use it Adam what are the  reasons they're using ready for this  then this is off school right right now  I could say go on it right now yeah  right you can say this I need a I need a  sketch shot Friday I need some ideas I  just put in their little search thing  come up with 50 sketch ideas  is at capacity right now we can't even  get in that's how many people are trying  to get off yeah that's how many college  kids are trying to get through essays  he's talking it's basically doing all  the work for you so you don't have to  it's basically it's the robot is doing  all the work and I mean then you could  take it's it's I don't know bro so so  writing papers  so for example I'll give you I'll give  you I'll give you an idea so let's just  say you're about to interview uh Elon  Musk or you're about to interact about  that it's coming up you're about to  interview whoever let's just say you're  interviewing somebody you're looking  forward to you say uh give me 10  questions no one no one's ever asked  Elon Musk in an interview it'll give you  more questions  and make it original too okay hey give  me it can now write code oh my God it  can write code it can make rap songs it  can make real it can make I mean it's  the capability and by the way this is  1.0 yeah this is not 2.0 3.0 5.0 not at  all this is 1.0 go ahead Tom  I'll ask one quick question  the usage of this thing is so spread  wide it is like the internet for AI if  you think of it that way it's that big  when do you think they will have on a  trailing one month 12 month basis a  billion dollars in Revenue  and I'll and I'll help you out your  answer will be in in months wow how many  months until they will have a trailing  billion dollars six months what are the  revenue sources is it advertising  because is this open to the public how  do they make money usage is the answer  the answer is 17 months before the end  of 2024 they will be running a billion  dollar Revenue company not valuation  because a VC thought oh I'll give you  your unicorn valuation Revenue okay and  gbt4 there there we go  gpt4 there it is is is coming and that's  just going to accelerate it further and  GPT by the way Theo is putting a billion  dollars on here the planetary guys are  they public yet huh palantir guys  palantir yeah sorry sorry how are they  driving revenue is it all oh it's going  to be 7.99 a week I believe it's going  to be seven can you look to see how much  it's going to be perfect you have to pay  for to use it it's a plug-in license  that's basically the the way it works  plug into what whatever you want what  are you plugging into you can plug it  into  a term paper website and so you and I  run a term paper website people can go  and build term paper we pay a plug-in  licensing fee every time it's used and  we there's a subscription model built  into it correct and but is that how  they're going to make the majority of  their of their revenue or is it going to  be spot like sponsors advertising that  kind of stuff ad Revenue I I think it's  D all of the above and because like  right now Adam you could go in and it'll  print something that's only like two or  three pages for you or like a page you  have to pay to get the  November November wow it launched at in  six it's the fastest ever to get to a  million users how do you think Rob got  all this you think Rob did this yeah Rob  didn't do that Rob didn't even do it by  the way by the way give me a podcast out  here's what
