 so just this year alone AI has had a lot  of action Dolly too earlier this year  with images and now chat GPT with an AI  chatbot that has conversations and  detailed articulate answers so I'm just  going to say right now if you haven't  checked this out yet you really have to  you're doing yourself a disservice  because AI has gone such a long way and  when you start writing the prompts is  going to blow your mind now the company  that made this open AI it's actually  been at this for a pretty long time so  just really quick openai is a leading  artificial intelligence research company  based in San Francisco founded by Elon  Musk Sam Owen and a bunch of other  people and Chad gbt from openai is  actually a fine-tuned version of another  one of their models gbt 3.5 there's  actually a part of their larger family  of prediction models in the GPT and  Series so first off what is this what is  chat GPT so chat GPT is a chat bot and  it was released in November to basically  demonstrate what the capabilities are in  terms of this technology and actually  have some more of live testing as well  but just in general gbt models are  trained on large data sets of texts and  uses this trans former architecture to  generate this human life interaction and  does this by considering the context of  a word in relation to the rest of the  sentence rather than just each word in  isolation so a Chad GPT actually takes  this one step further by doing some more  testing to actually give you this  conversational style as well and when it  launched it actually reached 1 million  users in only the first five days so you  can ask as many questions as you like  and it usually responds with some pretty  relevant information for example here if  I want to ask it to explain like what is  AI then it'll actually write it out for  me as is shown right here on the screen  I can even ask it to write programs as  well so here I'm asking it to write in  Python it's actually giving some pretty  nice code on how to do this and so just  off the bat this is a really really  sophisticated intelligent AI algorithm  and this actually makes me really really  hopeful for what AI will be to come but  there are still some limitations  involving it so first like I mentioned  before some of it is just not accurate  sometimes it's completely wrong and  science is not factual at all so for  instance a mic Pearl from Mash table he  actually tested it with a series of  questions and one of those questions was  what is the largest country in Central  America that isn't Mexico and then it  responded with Guatemala when the answer  is actually Nicaragua so there's also  some algorithmic bias as well and this  really just comes down to the training  data itself and like what was actually  fed with the model and so for instance  some ambiguous descriptors of like  people such as a CEO it could  automatically assume that that's gonna  be like a white male and that's just  based off the training data basically  and open AI doesn't try to hide this it  actually says you know at the bottom  I'll put it in the link in description  below about what some of the limitations  are as well as even gives down some  safety features as well of what they've  been trying to mitigate and and reduce  inside of it and to open AI even say  that sometimes it'll write plausible  sounding but incorrect nonsensical  answers and this is a challenge due to  the underlying way that the algorithm  was trained but it's also sensitive to  the way that you actually phrase the  question as well so sometimes if you  phrase it and change the words around  you might actually get a really really  verbose answer signs you might even get  a slightly different answer as well now  with all things AI there's also a lot of  safety and ethical concerns as well and  so they've really been trying to put a  lot of types of limitation on the AI in  terms of making it you know more safe to  use for instance the model will actually  refuse to answer some specific questions  so if it's inappropriate it'll just not  answer it at all and sometimes you know  if it doesn't do that if it doesn't  refuse it it'll just give harmful  instructions or have like a really  really biased Behavior as well so for  instance in previous models you could  just ask it literally anything you could  be like hey how do I beat somebody up  how do I bully somebody how do I break  into a house and it would just tell you  how to do it a step-by-step format of  how to do it and so obviously these are  things that openai does not want to have  out there or put out there so they've  actually really really tried to program  it to make it so it does not produce any  violent content at all there's a lot of  limitations this is where openai really  really wants feedback on the algorithm  you can actually put feedback like  inside of the website when you're using  it and you can actually flag you know if  you find something bored you can put it  in there and then flag it as well so  overall chat GPT there has been a lot of  progress here just on the AI itself but  also on the conversational style if you  have a conversation with it it'll  actually remember previous responses and  everything so it's really really gone a  long way and so this kind of  conversational style but also just this  algorithm in general really really has a  lot of applications for today and so I'm  really excited to see the next couple of  durations and I'm just really excited  that this thing is out just super cool  I've been using it all the time so  anyways hope you enjoyed this was really  cool I want to try and keep it short and  not really go into too much technical  detail but overall I hope you enjoyed  and I'll see you in the next one
