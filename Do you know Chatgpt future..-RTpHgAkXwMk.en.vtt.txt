 when shares start selling chat GPT could  be worth 29 billion dollars let's  examine how that might be more  thoroughly  chat GPT was created by openi  they are in discussions to sell their  current shares in a tender offer we will  talk about them in more detail shortly  The Wall Street Journal estimates that  the company would be worth 29 billion  dollars  investors are being told by open app  that they anticipate revenues of 200  million dollars next year  and one billion dollars by 2024 they  will find ways to despite the fact that  their main selling point is chat GPT  which is currently free there is no  information available about how they  expect to generate that Revenue  however who knows many they will find a  way to incorporate subliminal  advertising that would seamlessly blend  in with the conversation with their ad  program  when a business offers the chance to  purchase any stock or shares that are  currently held by other people such as  the one being offered by open eye it is  executing a tender offer  the intention behind this would be to  reclaim the majority of the equity in  your company or you might know that  things are about to get really good for  you and want the chance to sell to Rich  investors and the General Public  share sales in response to this offer  are anticipated to reach 300 million  dollars  if you've never heard of chat GPT you're  probably curious wondering what on Earth  we are talking about while scratching  your head  I'll explain Chad gbt also known as the  generative pre-trained Transformer is a  chatbot that was just introduced in  November 2022  with this eye you could have in-depth  conversations and the more people who  use it the more intelligent and smart  the program becomes  that's not terrifying it's made to  closely resemble human speech if that  terrifies you as much as it terrifies me  click the Subscribe button and let's  join the fight against the impending eye  and robots  is there anything that Elon Musk doesn't  have his hands in as previously  mentioned chat DPT was developed by open  eye a research company founded by Elon  Musk and Sam Walkman  you can read some of open A's research  blogs on their website where they taught  a robotic and how to solve a Rubik's  Cube in 2019 while it was being prodded  by a stuffed giraffe if you want to feel  stupid and inferior  how let the world be affected by air of  this caliber the answer is that the  human race is hilariously doomed if  Terminator iRobot ex machina or 2001 A  Space Odyssey have anything to do with  it  I'll stop talking about do now but Chad  gbt has already had real world effects  in its short time Among Us for example  students looking for a way out could ask  Chad GPT to write a thesis paper on Star  Wars Gladiator in Game of Thrones with  the subject being how loving your  sibling too much can affect your  livelihood and Presto they would have a  thorough research paper all thanks to I  so hopefully the TA grading the papers  pays close enough attention  chat GPT did say they would look into  different ways to recognize this level  of cheating  the potential impact of AI on social  structures around the world is that  another concern  as an illustration consider the walk in  Phoenix and Scarlett Johansson Filmer  the idea Remains the Same why go out and  meet people and explore the world when  you have something at home validating  you  sure we may be a long way from selling  odd companions  it's a tricky business and data  collection is another worry  what can open eye do and how much of our  private lives are we willing to divulge  to a chatbot like gbt  all the issue of how data is collected  and used is not new it still has a  significant impact on pretty much  everything we do online or with our  mobile devices  finally a blog post on openeye's website  that discusses the potential abuse of  language models for misinformation  campaigns can be found there there is  questions about the potential impact of  changing language models and operations  and the possible countermeasures  just the fact that they are aware the  dangers makes me happy  eye must pause and consider whether it  should use its capabilities for good or  for ill the only way to increase profits  for their company's investors would be  to continue their Research into advanced  artificial intelligence but do we really  need that comment your opinion thank you  for watching
