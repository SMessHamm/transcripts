 hey guys good afternoon  um so track GPT  so Jack GPT is  gonna be the future around Holy Cross on  a i a i is actually becoming real  like um like we're gonna start having  robots and drones like they'll probably  be replacing um  labor and workers and all that like I've  been doing a lot of research  um this morning on chat gbt I was  watching some videos looking up some  articles on it like everyone is saying  like like people having some mixed  opinions about if they're going to  replace like freelance jobs like  copywriting or  um riding or blogging  because that's what gbt is right now  um oh yeah I should have I should  explain What Chai gbt is uh chat GPT is  a tool  um I haven't used it yet I'm gonna use  it in a couple of minutes  um because I want to like test it out  and see what it does  but to my knowledge chat GPT is an open  source AI tool where you can ask you  like anything  um and it's going to spit out a bunch of  texts for you so you can like send it an  essay prompt for English class or  something and it's going to send you a  full ass like Doro essay  when that's fully articulated and has  good points and  um but me there's going to be some parts  that you need to edit  like in terms of words like um  like maybe it's too wordy or maybe it'd  say some stuff that's just not true  um that's up to the person who asked the  essay prompt to go ahead copy and paste  it and edit the genre so that it's going  to look good so this tool is very good  for like people whose jobs are that they  need to write a lot because they can use  this tool to  um use it as a first draft  um and it take and it basically  accelerates a bunch of the work that you  do so making the first draft is like  part of the work that they have to do  and um having an AI do that for you like  doing all the writing and all the words  and stuff saves a lot of time and it's  up to you just to like edit and stuff  and um that's what the future of the  chat GPT is right now the main usage of  it for those um copywriters bloggers  even Video Edit like even people make  videos like me  um  that you can use it for making a script  and I want to like see if you can  actually do that but everyone else is  saying that you can do it like that so  I'm just gonna have to go ahead and  check it out but that's what track GPT  is it's very easy to accept accessible  because you can  type in its chat box like what you want  from the AI and it's going to send you  all the stuff  so it's really exciting stuff and um AI  is really coming like into the world I  mean geez I mean it owes you  like I played that job it's like a  circle game rhythm game and there's like  a really a V2 on there that's literally  Ai and that shot is literally like the  main topic of every conversation oh you  see right now and then now we have chat  GPT where you can ask it anything and  it's gonna send you I mean like it's I  mean of course anything like as long as  I guess not something that's very  harmful to the human race like I think  it was by a guy named Alex or something  I was watching this video  um it was called um get retro track gbt  because I was like oh wait you can make  some money off this and um the main uses  of like like to summarize his video to  mainly can you make money with gbts that  again like as I said earlier you can  accelerate the amount of work you do  and track GPT basically um 100x is your  profit because the 100 X's do your work  output because AI can process  information on a way faster rate than  humans can so having an AI do all that  job for you  um increases your work productivity by a  crazy amount  um I was reading millionaire Fastlane  yesterday and  um there was a parable in there that  like basically said this it was like an  Egyptian one there was like two brothers  uh they're potassium to go to Pyramid  for the Pharaoh and um the person who  made  um the pyramid is going to be granted  kingship and a lot of riches like just  luxury for life and these guys are both  like 18 years old and like one of the  guys was like I bet I'm gonna just go  ahead and do it manually so he's doing  like manually placing Stone by Stone and  he's like and then he checked on his  brother and his brother's not even doing  to work like he went to like go to his  place his brother I was like bro what  are you doing you're in Team bro and  he's like nah nah trust me bro trust me  and he was like damn bro all right so he  just went back to like doing a manual  labor doing a strength training doing  the stone by Stone and it was and  eventually got to a point where like it  was just too much bro like it's gonna  take him like 30 years to form  physically finish it and then his  brother pulled up and he had this  gigantic machine bruh and he just left  this machine do it all for him and he  finished up here in about eight years  and the other guy he was like almost  done  but like he died like on the 12th layer  like because of a heart attack he didn't  even see what like the pyramid was going  to be and he wasn't even able to  experience kingship and all the riches  but his brother did because he made the  machine and in this case it's that's the  AI  the  the track GPT so like copywriters they  could use like the brother that made the  machine they can use AI to accelerate  their work the people who just don't  just want to ignore it and just go back  to their own ways of manually type in  all the job is going to be the guy who  did all the heavy lifting himself so I  mean it's really up to us just to  um make the changes adapt to them  so I mean it's really exciting stuff  there's AI stuff well I gotta drink this  tea really quick  that's for my skin condition bro  yeah surprises  um I think it's um  I think it's sarfonte or it's dark wood  it's one of those  anyways um tragic BT is going to be the  future man this thing is crazy  um I'm probably gonna try to make a  video about it no I'm going to make a  video about it  um because I just want to test what it  can do  um and I need and I really need to make  more videos bro because I need to make  money man holy crap  um like I just like lately this winter  break I've been slacking and  I've just like been chilling with my  friends I mean of course it's fun to  like play for friends and stuff like  video games and playing the video game  and stuff and I've been playing a [ __ ]  ton of games bro  the most I played and like this whole  year I think  um  but I mean maybe not this whole year  but like as of recently it's the most  I've ever played  um  well I'm still going to the gym I'm  still going  um  like eating clean and all that but  anyways  yeah that's pretty much it see ya
