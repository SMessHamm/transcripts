 like these things will keep growing and  growing and will get to a GPT 10. where  it doesn't only it's not only trained on  data publicly available but it can I can  plug it with my home automation  and I can and it's reading the events  you know the camera movements how many  times I opened I switched on the lights  uh it's plugged into my car and it knows  the trips that I have done it's plugged  into my keyboard I mean those I mean  it's scary as hell  but like but just one thing you said  that was very interesting you said  the first question is is the CCP I think  that's the cloud practitioner  certification any good for people  practicing uh SRE slash devops roles and  should they start with it or jump ahead  to the solution architect Associates  let me let me let me take a stab at this  and another let me know what you think  so the cloud practitioner certificate is  really a beginner certificate it's  really a certificate for someone who  doesn't who deals with the cloud on  regular basis but they don't have to  build and deploy stuff on the cloud  right so you want to understand the  billing uh in the cloud you want to  understand the value proposition that  the clown brings in you want to  understand the difference between a VM  between a container what that serverless  brings to the table uh what is a  database what is a nosql database you  want to understand all these things but  you don't have to build stuff on the  cloud so basically the people I see  benefits in a lot from the cloud  practitioner are people who are in a  managerial position  so say you're you're a manager and then  your developers you know your team build  and deploys and maintain stuff on the  cloud and you want to talk their  language and you want to understand  their problems so that's you know the  kind of a certificate Advocate I would  advise you to go to  um  it will not give you all the tools you  need and it will not prepare you to for  devops you know for for a platform or a  reliability engineer or a devops role  um what do you think Adele what's your  take on this to be honest I've never  while you were talking I was looking  into what it is actually okay yeah this  is an AWS certificate yeah okay it's an  AWS one okay okay  um I mean if it's if it's if it's  beginner certificate we have something  similar on on on on Google which is the  certified digital leader or something  so uh did you cut off your camera ideas  are you still around  yeah yes okay that's fine so anyway  um so I would say like if you say it's a  basic certificate it's like a like for  beginners uh then it's probably not  worth it for somebody who wants to learn  SRE or devops but I'm not going to  answer the question directly I'm just  gonna take a different like like route  to it which is  like  I think people have to understand one  thing is that SRA and devops are two  different things right extremely  different things  um and neither of them is an actual set  of technical things it's just a  framework for a way of organizing people  around managing systems right it's a  mindset it's a mindset exactly so devops  is  um is a generic thing right that's why  one of the things I don't I don't like  people when they say they're devops  engineer it doesn't mean anything right  it doesn't it doesn't have a meaning  um so devops is set of practices there  is a book called The devops cookbook or  handbook or something um we'll find the  link and put it in chat later that I  highly recommend people to look at which  explains the basics  SRE is an implementation of devops  um so it's it's our implementation well  it's Google implementation which then  now everybody does it but and there is  also a book if you want to understand  what SRE is I would highly recommend to  read the books first just go read what  devops means in the devops  handbook book and then we have three  books around SRE and I think  sre.google.com or sre.google you will  find the three books that are free to  download  um so  like to give you a more concrete example  I did a rotation with SRE at Google when  I was working in Belgium I went to  Dublin for rotation rights with remote  but it was rotation so I went there I  did a rotation with an SRA team Colossus  team which is Colossus is our internal  distribution file system and when I was  interviewing they were mostly  interviewing me around my knowledge of  Linux networking and systems  Distribution Systems they didn't there  was no such thing as an SRE interview it  was all very computer science  fundamentals interviews like do you  understand how things work basically and  that's mostly my understanding is that  the interviewer I got was a mini version  of the actual interview we do for  external candidates but I was told  that's the same exact thing is these are  the things we look at Distribution  Systems Linux or operating systems in  general networking security stuff like  that right so so what I'm trying to say  here is that like even if you want to  interview for SRA Google which we have  been accredited for creating SRE you're  not going to be interviewed about  something specific toaster sorry right  it's more your basic knowledge of of  unprogramming obviously so so yeah that  would be my by taking to it  got it yeah that's uh it's something  that keeps coming you know again and  again and I I totally agree with you  what I want my developers to be devops  like to have them in the devops  mentality to  to not only build their code but build  the infrastructure on which they're  called run and monitor it and maintain  it and you know use all these tools that  we call devops tools and but it seems  that in the Enterprise world  there is this distinction between devops  like people want to be called devops and  uh and and even when I in the company  working right now when I call them  platform Engineers uh there's some  people who push back there's there's  some pushback so we have a tool asking  us a question okay so what oh this is a  book yeah yeah awesome awesome okay I'll  I'll add this also to the notes uh of  the episode so Atwell has a question  layoffs and job cuts across the tech  industry and how to prepare how long  you've been at Google uh up there nine  years nine years nine years and counting  okay during these nine years have you  ever thought about leaving Google  no  I've interviewed  I have had interviews I have had  recruiters reach out to me but I have  not  found anything that was interesting so  far considering the current set of  circumstances  so  you think  that you didn't leave Google is actually  the lack of opportunities out there you  know it's you haven't found anything  that would get as close as what you're  getting you know in a company like  Google  correct and also  um yeah mostly that  um either the interviews I did either  they were  a lot of I don't know about you but I  get a lot I got a lot of times  approached by startups  um startups do like to approach people  that work in Fang because experience you  know you you know things and  um a lot of times their proposals is  usually some sort of salary plus equity  and you know there is a certain level of  risk you have to be and a lot of risk  exactly exactly this is the level of  risk you will have to to to think into  this my take into startups is basically  if it's not mine if I haven't built it I  don't want to work as startup again  um because I watched startups before  um otherwise here in Sweden where I am  right now there isn't really that much  product companies so companies making  products a lot of times I get approached  by you know companies  um Spotify is okay that's okay that's a  very good one I have been approached by  Spotify but but I did not like the role  they proposed to me uh basically so I  said no  um so yeah  yeah and during this nine years have you  had the chance to interview people oh  yes a lot of them I think I am number  two or three interviewer in in me or  something it's a lot of interviews all  right you know where I'm going so you  must have a ton of experience  interviewing people reviewing resumes  what would you say to someone who is  preparing their resume is in the current  economic downturn you know our our  economy our  sector our industry is cyclical there  are times where money is pouring on sky  is the limit everyone is going grow grow  grow grow grow  why do we even need automation we can  just hire five people I mean great  companies always automate but during  this you know like like the times where  we were before covet right um  there was there was just VCS of throwing  money crypto is going up and then we get  to the next cycle which we are right now  which is all about efficiency yes uh you  know we're not we're not looking to hire  more or spend more we're looking to get  more with the resources that we have  right now  um you know what what is your take on  this do you think that people should  move roles or jobs and start focusing  more on on roles where  you know they can bring more to the  company and focus on efficiency uh like  do we have to invent new roles new  positions do we need to reinvent  ourselves and focus on other uh uh I  don't know other sectors Industries like  how do you think one should  approach the current economic downturn  that's a very good question there is a  lot to unpack there um but let me try to  answer one one thing at that time do we  should I mean  10 10 20 years ago no one knew what  devops is right our industry is very  known for just creating things all the  time  um and sometimes even taking all things  and putting a new name on them  yeah so I think I like this this  interview that was done with economists  that I follow I forgot his name I'm  American Economist and who's asked about  this specific question but more generic  like and at the jobs level in general  and he said basically 60 years ago we  didn't know what the developer is right  so so either cannot predict the future  right like basically what what or let's  just take it something that is more  maybe more our like our background and  more kind of close to us because we see  it  is 20 years ago when we're 15 years ago  when Cloud showed up  um AWS is 21 years old right  um yeah 2005 2006. yeah so 20 years ago  when AWS released Cloud everybody was  scared saying oh they're gonna take away  infrastructure so what are we going to  do with all this infrastructure people  that's work here right have anybody  experienced layoffs because of AWS I  don't think so right I think that that  that's  arguably your ability to reinvent  yourself is the most important skill  that you should have as a tech person  your ability to adapt and adjust and not  be stuck in one thing that it's like  with the mindset of like I only want to  work on this technology or on this thing  or and even if you do our industry have  proved that things disappeared and come  back like beginning of copied the the  mayor of New York was looking for people  who does basketball right which was  crazy I didn't follow that story did he  find it yes well I don't know if they  found it but in in a press conference  they would say like we want people who  know because that's the system they use  to some sort of like social Aid System  was written in Kabul and they needed  people  um to to help them take in like to  maintain the system because they were  taking in applications from you know  citizens so um I remember when I was in  Belgium  um about seven seven years ago a  colleague of mine his girlfriend was  um doing you know in France they have  this thing called  which is the the kind of Chinese yeah  that's how I call it Steve Jobs it's the  unemployment agency if you want you  register with them they help you find  job Etc and what this this company what  these agencies do from time to time is  that they they offer to people uh  training opportunities and the  girlfriend of my colleague  um back in the days she was training to  become a cobal developer because France  was like in Cobble developers so they  actually created the whole program for a  year and they got people in for free and  I think they were paid something and  they were just learning how to become a  Cobalt developer and they were a  promised job  sorry sorry to interview but don't you  think that it would be more efficient to  modernize these old systems rather than  invest in informing people to maintain  these old systems because at some point  they're just gonna be too old yes that  makes a lot of sense in a perfect world  you will click a button and change  everything but you know how how  migrations work right it takes time so  the question the question here is what  do we do in the meanwhile while you are  moving toward the modern model stack  foreign  they are probably doing I mean I know  that Banks I worked with banks in my  experience with cloud and and I know  they are in the actually we did I think  we acquired the company in the  Netherlands Google acquired the company  in Netherlands that does automatic  um Cobalt to Java code uh migration so  they brought the tool that reads Kabul  and spits out Java code and uh but Java  source code not Java binaries actually  it was it was it was crazy what the hell  they were able to do is by the way the  point I'm trying to say here is that  your ability as a person to reinvent  yourself and learn new things is  arguably the most important thing  especially in this uncertain time if you  want right  and  um as I just  um yesterday the day before I was with  the Geeks blah blah fox in their online  conference blah blah blah conf and they  did my talk which was several lessons  learned from becoming a senior engineer  and one of the lessons I shared in that  in that talk was  the more senior becoming a company the  more what's important or the value  you're bringing to the table is your  experience not your knowledge right it's  the fact that you have been around for a  while and you know how things work and  you know how they scale and they don't  scale this is even more important than  actually knowing the technology itself  right no in technology is all cool but  the company pays you because you have  experience that's what they pay you for  so  so to answer your question should we  change jobs I mean I think  I think it really depends on what your  goal is if your goal is to make more  money and there is somebody offering you  more money go for it knock yourself down  um if your goal is to help a company  really do something interesting and  either grow or optimize or you know  something that that is  um like that you have expertise on and  you will feel fulfilled by doing it go  for it I would say  um if I I'm right now in the mindset of  like should I actually start my own  startup right  um because that's more appealing to me  because there is I mean coffee that  showed us showed us that as a society we  are lacking certain things there are  certain aspects of our life that we have  just taken for granted and then when  there is a pandemic which we're gonna  have another one in 10 years for sure  um we're gonna just struggle again with  the same things right so  um so so so yeah I mean  it it's a very hard question to answer  in the sense that like it really depends  on what your goal is as a person how to  yeah but go ahead and and then we can  talk about how to prepare  okay okay  um I I like you I believe that every  technology is but a step to the next  technology it's nothing is gonna like  you know uh  stay forever  um  the  but I didn't I just want to take a step  back and think about the people who are  affected by the layoffs like these  people they don't have like they have to  take a decision right now today they  don't have the choice or they don't have  the luxury to just sit back and you know  think uh I'm probably gonna think about  creating for example my startup or maybe  I should you know start interviewing  because  that time is God they don't have that  luxury what do you think from your  perspective you know I'm just throwing a  hard question at you I know but from  your perspective as someone who  interviewed a ton of people and like you  see the the trends in resumes and you  see the trends also in  where people leave to come to interview  to Google for example would you say that  the cloud is still can still provide  that security or or [ __ ] company can  still provide that kind of security for  the future uh or it's better to as you  said no you know what if you find  yourself you know you're back against  the wall you lost your job it's better  to start your own company  um is it do you think that for example a  developer's job is something to  really invest heavily on because we're  still going to have Developers for the  next 5-10 years are we better with the  cloud  moving and with the cloud like opening  these new doors maybe you think that  security in the cloud is the best  option maybe you think  platform is the best option going  forward I know like it's it's a tough  question I just want to pick your brain  and see what you think about it it's a  very good question I mean I don't think  that Fang can prove can prove can  provide  um uh job security I mean it's true that  none of the big companies so far except  Facebook have announced layoffs  um some companies have announced that  they are shrinking or refocusing their  their Workforce on some other stuff like  you know we discontinue stadia maybe  Microsoft tomorrow will stop something  or AWS will say okay we're not going to  invest money in this service or whatever  unless they're they're like stopping  development of Alexa right now there you  go that's a very good example so  and and you just triggered your Alexa  I think that that's that's  again goes back to the point of your  ability to just learn new things is very  important right  um your ability to just like move  somewhere else on different parts of the  company and just refocus your your work  on something else this is very important  um  so back to your question about like  resumes and stuff so I can share a  couple of things that I have seen in my  experience that that you should probably  avoid doing I do not like I personally I  do not like people when they have a  resume where they have this paragraph in  the beginning of the resume where they  talk about themselves in third person  um especially when it's like a lot of  fluff you know I'm like a goal-oriented  whatever whatever buzzwords yeah exactly  um just don't do that just just skip it  um  um make sure your resume is as short and  straight to the point as possible  um those stuff about who you are and  talking about yourself in the third  person is better put in a cover letter  if you feel like writing a covered  letter if you feel like you want to tell  the recruiter something that would not  be obvious in a resume maybe write a  cover letter or just put it in your  email right  um but most of the time a recruiter if  they pick up your your your resume they  will want to have a first like talk with  you right so you will be have an  opportunity to tell them in person  anyway  um  don't talk about technologies that you  don't you don't you don't don't put  Technologies no understanding your  resume period because the more stuff you  have there the more I'm gonna try to  pick your brain on everything right  that's that's just um kind of push you  until I get to your limits because I  know your limits exactly and um in our  interviews I don't know about ews but in  our interviews we have our our  interviews are open-ended questions so  the question starts with design a system  that does X and then we keep expanding  on that right so so that's basically  where you get to to check the knowledge  of people on every layer of the stack  security web you know apis there's  Distribution Systems blah databases blah  blah blah so so at some point you're  gonna be I mean at some point you you'll  reach a point where you can't answer  anymore and that's fine and that's how  we actually get to assess how much you  know  um uh it's fine to say I don't know if  you are doing an interview it's totally  and absolutely okay to just not know  things  um it's better than trying to to know  things that you don't know  um and the interviewer will smell it  right away yes you will know right away  with someone it's just trying to BSU  yeah and I would say the one last thing  is like generally speaking a red flag  for me in the resume is people who do  job job hunting job jumping so just go  from one job to another every year  children companies that's usually a very  bad I mean if you have to do that but if  you have me if you have only spent like  three three months or six months in a  company and then you move to another  company that could be an indication that  you just didn't like it which is fine  right  um although I would arguably say if you  only spent three months in a company and  jump somewhere else because you didn't  like it just don't put it in your resume  like there is no point that's true well  what I what I for me there's like the  beginning of the career and then the mid  uh level or seniority of the career so  when I started my career I used to jump  a lot I was to spend like one year 14  months 15 months in a company and then  jump to another one and why is because I  wanted to learn as much as I can solve  as many problems as I can and also the  easiest way to increase your salary is  to actually change the company like you  can stay in a company and get a  promotion and that's what five percent  ten percent ten percent if you're lucky  but then you can challenge uh uh you  know the company and and get a little  bit more but then I would say in my mid  uh uh level that's when I started to  spend a little bit more more time in the  company and that's pretty much my advice  like when you're starting your career  jump be be feel free to experience new  things to fail maybe like I worked with  the with the startup  we were building this machine learning  stuff before the turn machine learning  became the buzzword that it is today we  didn't call it machine learning we just  we hired someone who had a PhD in data  classification and stuff and we used to  aggregate data and run uh the supervised  and unsupervised stuff on it and then  try to mine it and get information from  it  and that was great they opened some  doors for me but then I realized no  that's not what I want so like I changed  it maybe nine months ten months since  when I charge something else so I I get  I get exactly what you  what do you say but I this is why I  still give people the benefits of the  doubts if someone if I see someone doing  what I call is  um  job uh job jumper job bunny like I said  I'm like you're a job bunny like you  just jump between one like I always try  to ask why and one of the accepted  answers for me is I didn't like it or I  was looking for more money you know  that's that's a really accepted answer  for me it's when I ask someone tell me  about your achievements in a company one  of accept the accepted answers is I made  them more money like this is something  that I totally like I love it when  someone tells me in my previous job I  increased you know the revenue by like  50 for me it's way better than someone  who just listed lists their uh you know  job responsibilities I have actually an  episode about resume is that we're gonna  uh I'm gonna take a little bit of bits  of what you just said I'm gonna add them  into that into that episode as well  um so for people who finds themselves  you know there's a huge layoff right now  happening and so for people who find  themselves out of a job would you say  um it's a case per case scenario there's  no you know generic answer for some  people the best thing is to reinvent  themselves and uh you know try something  else maybe you have been a developer for  a while now you go to the market you go  to LinkedIn and then you see there are  more openings towards devops  um you know take some time do a couple  of trainings courses certifications and  try to reinvent yourself you know in a  devops world right or maybe  um I've seen some people who have been  tech leads and they're Reinventing  themselves into products owners yes  they've been there right so they've  built products they've managed teams  they focused on it on a from a technical  side but now there's this opportunity to  focus on them you know from a product  side and I always appreciate it when I  interview someone and he says  this is a new frontier for me I'm  willing to learn I have this ability to  learn I'm wanting to put into work I'm  willing I mean at the end of the day  you know we're not born this small rock  can say no one is born  Sage or Savant or or scientist or  someone like this person yeah a wise  person right we always have to learn  yeah  to  that um  like  I've seen I've seen people who have a  community around them or are part of  some sort of Community are more  successful at getting jobs after they  are laid off that doesn't that doesn't  necessarily mean that you have to go  credit to your account and start writing  stuff on the internet today but being  part of community could also be you are  part of some sort of online Forum or you  are helping people on stack Overflow or  or you are doing meetups or you go to  meet people who use the same  Technologies as you in your local area  right you're part of some sort of  community that helps in the sense that  you have a network you have people you  know um like our industry is arguably  not the geeky type anymore that we used  to be like 25 years ago where you're  sitting in your basements and doing  things by yourself people like this  still exist right but but it's more and  more kind of Community Based or  Community oriented one more thing I  would add is maybe participate in some  more contribute to open source um I mean  there are companies now that would pay  you to maintain open source code  um so just pick some projects that you  like can start maybe contributing to it  and clear business open source does not  have to be contributing to code you  could start with documentation you could  start with testing you could start with  you know anything that that just is up  your level of expertise  um  and then you talked about like yeah  learn some some new uh um uh new stuff  one thing I'd like also to advise people  is don't like I like to call this skip  the titles when you're looking for jobs  don't just read the title read the  actual description of what the job is  about a lot of times people  post a devops job but it's a developer  job what they're looking for they do  yeah they do or they say oh you are  looking for an SRE but they're looking  for like a system administrator or like  for a database administrator or like  there or they say oh we're looking for  cloud engineer but they're actually just  looking for a backend developer so real  real story someone wanted to interview  about an architect position and it  turned out to be a developer position uh  when I was uh yeah yeah so so like read  into the description email the recruiter  ask them details schedule 30 minutes and  ask as much questions as you can like  the titles does not always say what the  job is about right you have to  understand it like more deeply I would  say  um and yeah I mean  there are ways you could take time off  as well like you know why not you'll be  laid off that's sad but just take time  off to process it and and think about  what you want to do don't just jump  quickly into  that the risk as well if doing things in  a in a in a hurry is that you would just  find yourself with something that you're  not happy with and then the the level of  these satisfaction just continues you'll  be laid off and then you end up doing  the job you don't want to do right  that's a good that's a good point you  know what when I look at my career  I was fired once  and then I was pushed out of the door  once  and in both cases  every time it felt like the world was  crumbling but actually I got better  opportunities afterwards and I know this  also because I talk to a lot of people  every time like you feel  or like you're fired or something like  that it's actually better in the long  run you feel that you know it's it's a  hit on the eagle that's for sure oh I'm  I'm not enough I'm not good enough and  stuff like that  um but it pushes you like you don't  learn by  living in a pink world and everything  like you learn when you go through this  it pushes you we all like to talk about  leaving your comfort zone but this is  the ultimate uh push out of your comfort  zone and I want to talk back also talk  about what you mentioned networking  um I would add another aspect to it  remote work so networking Place remote  work opens a ton of opportunities this  is why we are actually doing like I  chose this platform because I want to do  more events I want people to network  with each other and I want people from  India to start looking at jobs in  Ireland uh and Sweden in Germany and  like  we can't covet showed us that we  actually can do this kind of thing so  networking uh plus three months do you  have uh something else you want to add  here because I want to move to other uh  I was about to say the thing with remote  yeah just expand your search Circle  beyond your town or your city or your  country right um a lot of people will  pay you there are companies today and  that because I know this because I've  been offered a remote job there are  actually companies today that help  startups hire remote people because one  of the main questions become when when  you want to be hired remotely like say  you're in Canada you want to work for a  company in Sweden one of the main  questions is like does that company have  a legal entity in Canada so they can pay  you and pay social security and pay blah  blah blah and the remote positions come  in all forms the most easy one is  freelance so you become a freelance in  your own country you follow your own tax  laws and then you get money from outside  you just send an invoice and get get a  salary but there are companies that does  this now for you they can help you  remote locally and hire locally remote  people and and pay these people  following the local laws and the local  equations for Social Security and taxes  and everything so it's it's becoming  more easy it's becoming even easier  actually to do remote now than it was  before so  we have a question from will about SRE  and devops so let's let's uh okay let me  read it at a high level is there a  difference between devops and SRE or is  SRE just the Google term for a devops  way of thinking so how can you answer  this you know in a in a few sentences  yes there is a very key difference  um as I said SRE is an implementation of  DeVos methodologies  um it's our own implementation but it's  not only ours like we talk about it  publicly so there are a lot of companies  now doing SRE as well the same way we do  it one of the key differences that SRE  has versus  um devops is this concept of um error  budgets so when you have a service and  you have an SRE team responsible for  that service the SRA team and the  developer team the product team that sit  they sit down and they agree on an SLA  on a service level it's also a rather a  service level objective this service is  going to be available 99.9 of the time  which means it only can be down eight  minutes per per month then they will  establish and set up a way to track  downtime because you need to be able to  measure it right so you have you set up  a way to observe and measure downtime  and then based on this observability  that you do you can re-  Focus the development team between  shipping new features and focusing on  performance and stability so the whole  point of this error budget is some sort  of contract between the development team  and the SRA team that says as long as  you're below your error your error  budgets as long as your service is not  down more than it should be per month we  will allow you to shop new ship new  feature right but if you blow up your  error budget for a month then we have a  right to just say okay stop now and then  go focus on stability right  so this is a very key thing that we do  at SRE that doesn't that doesn't exist  technically in devops otherwise there  are the the two roles are fairly similar  it's all about automation it's all about  a team understanding the entire stack  including the software that runs on top  of the the thing they're running so run  it's on  um it's all about the automation  observability it's all similar that's  why I said in the beginning that that  what SRA teams at least as Google  they're looking for is just looking for  people who know things no Basics right  because like your your knowledge of the  fundamentals is transferable to any  system you're gonna work on right for  sure so so yeah so that would be the key  difference  what do you think about this gpt3 thing  do you think that we're going to be  obsolete at some point I mean I've been  I I was I was writing this Lambda  function and then it gave me an error  and I just went to gpc3 and I said and I  typed the error and said what is it and  it helps me debug it said oh you know  what maybe you want to retry it was  actually I was writing a naughtiest  thing and I I forgot to put the awaits  because it was asynchronous and it told  me oh in order to use this specific  thing you need to actually put it in an  asynchronous mode and I then I did it  and I had a timeout issue and then I  went to gpt3 and I said now this is the  error that I got and gpt3 said oh you  know what maybe uh there's this other  thing that you need to look at like are  we going to just ask this general  purpose text  uh engines in two three years to write  whole systems for us and just be become  obsolete what do you think so let me ask  you a question how is that different  from when you were in the office and you  asked your colleague this is not the  same thing it is but now it's faster  it's uh I would say has access to a lot  more information you know than any human  can do and it has  the knowledge of  all stack Overflow put into it so it can  right and and uh and it thoughts maybe  he thought about and you know what it's  not biased also like I mean okay it is  biased to a point but it's not as biased  as a human being would be yes so let me  start with saying this there was this  study that was done few few years back I  read the papers it was very interesting  but basically it's like a university in  the US I don't remember the name but  basically they came up with this  conclusion that 95 of code bases in any  company is open source  across the internet in other terms 95 of  all the code bases of old companies is  the same right and it's the three  percent or the five percent which is  your specific implementation which is  tailored toward your specific business  so if I would have to answer your  question I would say maybe it's not  going to make us obsolete but maybe it's  going to make  us more focused on the value-added  business thing rather than the generic  stuff because the way you describe it to  me like gpt3 just have to solve some  generic stuff some knowledge that  everybody has and it's already known to  the internet and you just didn't know it  at that specific moment so in a sense I  would say probably gpt3 will become in  10 years the the version of Google it  when people ask a question you say  Google it then it becomes like I'll just  ask gpd3 right that's that was my  following question do you think that  Google should be afraid because I could  have I could have Googled this problem  but instead of Googling it I preferred  as a person rather than going and using  a browser as an interface and going to  Google and going through a list and then  choosing I prefer to ask an engine uh uh  you know in a language that I speak is  like do you think that Google should be  afraid or that Google should reinvent  itself I you see I believe that the only  reason Google has not come up with  something like gpt3  or had has not made I'm sure that Google  has something Secrets uh has not made  something like gpt3 uh public yet is  because  it's hard to push ads in a in a  conversation like that and we all know  that Google is an ad machine right so I  think that's the only reason otherwise  Google would have been like building  this  yeah well there is obviously the the  ethical question about about chat Bots  right there is there is there is the  question of like oh now you are not just  type in your keywords into a search  engine which is does a quick database  and gives you a bunch of results you are  talking to a thing which is alive  putting a live between codes right  um so then the question becomes like and  you have remember this Microsoft thing  that just like they released an AI and  then in 24 hours it became Nazi  anti-immigrant whatever because people  were feeding It lines right so the  question then becomes like can we trust  the technology to not  take sites because it comes pre-trained  with a bunch of knowledge but I think  what the key thing with gp3 is that it  can learn on the spot it can learn while  talking to you as well it can  personalize answers because it knows you  right and that's why one of the reasons  why they ask you to log in because  otherwise just make it publicly  available to the internet why do you  want me to log in they want you to log  in because they want to track who you  are and they want to keep like a  personalized model if you want for you  so  and then the other the other thing to  keep in mind is that so far we're  talking about English like there are  tons of languages that these things does  not understand probably right so so and  then there is also the question of like  is it is a chat  based software or UI the right answer  for this kind of things right are as  everybody will be feeling comfortable  chatting with something or people are  still comfortable just looking things up  on a web page and reading for themselves  right so but how about efficiency  like if I have to read like I'm gonna  and you know the internet is about  selling advertisement like  advertisements run the world so if I'm  gonna Google something and I'm gonna go  I'm gonna go find the websites a blog  post then I'm gonna have to go through  10 paragraphs  just to get that one line that I need  because the person who's writing I mean  you know they need to pay their bills as  well so they need to write more so they  need to go you know all this uh uh  clickbaity stuff all this  how about an engine that would remove  all that and just get me like there's  there's a beautiful sense of efficiency  to it and as you said it would learn  like  it yeah that's that's a slippery slot  because Google also in order to  personalize The Experience needs a ton  of your data and then we hate on Google  because we say oh you you take all our  data but then you think that at some  point in GPT 4 gpt5 they need to consume  All This and like a gather all this  amounts of personal data in order to be  more efficient and so we'll have the  same problem at some points probably I  would say probably or very likely  because that's the thing like I think  that these AIS are good at giving you  generic answers  now it will become like I would be  probably scared if tomorrow I'll go to a  chat bot and I say hey I'm thinking  about buying a new pair of sneakers and  it will answer me with an ad to the  exact pair of sneaker I want not a  generic one like the ex like something  that the AI know I would like and I  would buy because that's the whole point  with ads is that ads is optimized to  Target show you the thing exactly yeah  so but in order for it to achieve that  it will have to know and learn things  about me yes and then we will come to  the question of like is this actually  okay right are we fine with having this  AI just learning all about our data the  same question with ads that we had like  25 years ago right so  so actually fine I'm I'm actually fine  with it I stopped trying to hide stuff  from Google a long time ago  yeah that's totally fine that's that's  totally okay and just that  I think that this this this all this  technology I'm very skeptical of these  things because when they show up people  think they're gonna change the world but  we have to see  um there is of course a lot of like we  are looking at it from the perspective  of technical people but there is a lot  of other types of content that these  like we have to see if this this chat  gpt3 thing can actually generate text  for it right like content that requires  Neons reporting on the news for example  is is the kind of content reporting on a  crime is the kinds of content  um I I just watched like here is an  example there is a very concrete example  that I would be curious and maybe I will  do it after this I will just go ask gpd3  so there is this podcast that I highly  recommend people to read uh to listen to  called Bay X it was created by New York  Times and so the tldr without going too  much into the details is that a few  years back  um the uh a gun was found in uh in the  airport in Vienna Austria right they  found a gun somewhere in like a  maintenance person in airport in Vienna  found the gun they set up a trap they  found the person who who who who who  came back to collect the gun they they  they they um they like questioned them  let them go then later on they learned  that this person was part of a com  special theory in Germany which was  plotting to take down the German  governments and this like happened it's  like I don't know if you remember a few  weeks back they Germany announced they  arrested a lot of people that's that's  massive arrest they have done done was  the results of three four years of work  on trying to like  this the  figure out this great work infiltrate  the network yeah and so and you know  it's it's like when you read it it gives  you when you listen to it gives you  chills because it just reminds me of  like second world war essentially  because these people are just known as  his subject that's that's who they are  right and so I would be very curious to  see if this gpt3 would have enough  neurons to link the events between what  happened in you know 1936 to 1940  something and what's what this new thing  that have just came up  um is about right like we didn't make we  didn't make a connection would it have  enough historical context to to say like  oh this thing looks like XYZ right and  if I would ask it how can you write me a  newspaper or newsletter or news article  about this  event that is happening today or just  very simple as soon as or as recent as  yesterday the French guy who went and  shot three people from the kurd  community in Paris right you're you're  following the news way more than I am  this is an European thing because I feel  here I just care about the snow and the  blizzard and we'll go went through a  storm that's my world  anyway whatever so I I I'd like I'd like  to see  these things tested well because I think  so far people are testing them with like  testing them with things that are have  like straightforward answers right well  well GPT 3 at its core is it's a  mathematical formula it's it's a network  that basically got feed all this data  this text on the Internet and try to  predict the next word that's what it  does like when you give it one two three  like a sequence of words  it tries to predict the next one right  at the end of the day based on the  amounts of data that it so that's why if  you ask it to write a blog post for you  for example you will see that it always  follows the same model I played with it  I said hey what are the top 10 things  that a cloud architect should do and it  just told me it starts by a definition  what is a cloud architect and then it  gives me one two three and then it ends  by a conclusion so  it doesn't you know it just it's just a  protection engine but I'm thinking with  time you can make it also what you can  do what these companies are doing if you  look at copy AI or or uh you know  there's some companies that  add wrappers around gpt3 and try to add  more business Logics on onto on top of  them so if you said like this Nuance  thing could be added with a wrapper  around it so you get the output from  gpt3 and then you plug into a new source  or you plug into a news API and then you  plug into the weather API until you plug  and then you try to combine all these  and and bring something that is up to  the especially that gpgs3 has been  trained I think up to uh data until 2021  so it doesn't have anything current  after 2021  right  and that's but I'm imagining like these  things will keep growing and growing and  will get to a GPT 10. where it doesn't  only it's not only trained on data  publicly available but it can I can plug  it with my home automation  and I can and it's reading the events  you know the camera movements how many  times I open I switched on the lights uh  it's plugged into my car and it knows  the trips that I have done it's plugged  into my keyboard and the impulse I mean  it's scary as hell  but like but but just one thing you said  that was very interesting you said that  you have asked the the thing to write an  article about something and you notice  the pattern right I did and that's  actually I asked it and that's actually  goes that's for me is extremely  interesting because like if you as a  human are able to see a pattern of  something that is generated by an AI it  just means that the AI is not clever  enough right yes it's yes yes so I think  I think it's funny I was looking into my  pension in Belgium today because you  know I lived in Belgium for four years  so I was looking into like how much  money I have I will how much money I  have there because I'm trying to get all  my pension money together I don't know  how Works in Canada but we have the  equivalent of 401 in yeah we do yeah the  complimentary one so you have the  government pension and then the extra  pension so I was looking into that  and um  yeah so what was the what was the point  I was trying to make well you said that  I was able to see a pattern so it's not  clever yeah it's not yeah  okay I lost my kind of okay that's fine  I really lost my own I thought okay so  at the end of the day I don't know yeah  now I remember okay so the the pension  thing taught me how much money I would  be making when I go on pension which is  for me nine uh 20 20 52 right so it just  made me think like we're gonna get to  2052 and this thing is going to be  clever but you're going to be old enough  that we wouldn't care I guess  that's it yeah so so it would become  just part of uh you know the daily  activities like kids right now they they  deal with for them iPads is part of  their life they can't imagine a life  without an iPad  I remember when we didn't have cell  phones and I had to call you had to call  someone at their home and if they're not  there it's just now you can just reach  everyone in part of the part of life  and I think we get as humans we get  overly excited for things when they are  we don't see my revolutionary but like  we are very bad at predicting what's  going to happen in 10 20 30 years like  we would not know so we can so we would  not know how this thing is gonna evolve  I would say for now just use it for what  it can do and if it if what it can do  helps you in their day-to-day Life by  all means but just don't don't overthink  it and that's how I approach this topic  yeah you're right um we you know why  we're biased about future because we  predict in a linear fashion we always  take what we have  and we try to improve like now we have  cars oh the future will have flying cars  uh now we have watches all the future  will have holographic watches but the  reality is there's always these Forks in  the world right people have horses and  then at some point we had cars we didn't  have like Faster Horses as the legend  goes so we have these Forks and who  knows maybe GPT now like  I don't know man maybe I've been reading  a lot about neurolink and about they're  doing this thing and so maybe the next  fork in the road is we don't even need  to use text anymore it would just be  telepathic right because communication  brain to a brain because text is like  it's stupid like language I mean from an  evolutionary perspective I need to talk  to you and it's taking seconds and it's  sequential it's word after the other  word and if I don't know a specific word  then it's hard for me to convey my  thoughts and then you need to sit there  and listen and then it's you know maybe  we need something better maybe we need  to take an idea and then boom send it  and then you get that idea so maybe  that's gonna be the next fork in the  road and in five years we don't even  need GPT anymore probably who who would  have predicted that the Moroccan  football team would make it to the  quarter finals of the World Cup right  and I think one thing I want to say is  that we we live in a bubble where we see  things move very fast and to me it's  always actually interesting to just like  make connections between how I see our  industry moving and how this is  impacting day-to-day life I can give you  a very simple example like yeah there is  gpt3 it's an AI Constructor which it can  write articles when I go to the US they  still take my physical credit card and  slide it into a machine they don't have  contactless payments so  here's another thought for you five  years ago when I was doing when I was  renewing my Canadian passport they asked  me do you want to renew for five years  or 10 years and five years ago I said no  just for five years because in five  years it's all going to be digital and  I'm just gonna use my iPhone now I have  to renew it again it's for another five  years yes no it's it's it's it like the  real question with this kind of things  with anything basically related to gpt3  and AI is how much impact it's gonna  have on the real life and keep in mind  that we are the tech industry where  probably one or point two percent of the  population on Earth there is eight  million people of us so yeah so that's  okay  no no no we are eight billion people on  Earth and we're just a subset of these  people I thought you said there's eight  million take take people in there no no  no I don't know how but like the point  I'm trying to make is that there isn't  only tech people there is truck drivers  and waiters and doctors and nurses and  there's a bunch of people and like how  was how is this thing gonna impact real  life is the real question  um and not whether it's gonna change  anything in the near future that's  probably more hard to answer this  question  did you know we have technology to have  self automated driven trains for like 15  years we had we have the technology  because the train is like you know just  go on stop but the whole reason we don't  have self-driven trains is the human is  unions it's the human aspect yes unions  keep pushing it back because it means  you're just gonna lay off uh you know  millions and I'm not sure about well  Millions worldwide of people who are  trained drivers or trade so yeah I 100  agree there's the human aspects  technology itself doesn't  it helps change the world and sometimes  it just pushes us through a cliff but  there's always this human aspect so if  tomorrow and you see I'm reading in the  news right now artists who are not happy  about this AI tools uh building you know  art or generates an art because they  think that it's stealing from them  as someone who doesn't know [ __ ] about  art it's for me it's all about  inspiration and if I was an artist  like all my life I would be looking at  what other artists painters for example  did and would study Monet and I would  study Leonardo da Vinci and I would and  and so I would come up with something  that would be the results of all this  inspiration that I got from all of them  how is that even different from an AI  doing it the AI is doing the same thing  it just studies everything else and  but there's that human aspect there's  that you know the the word at the end of  the day is I think  I don't want to take this tangent like  Consciousness and inspiration and stuff  I don't wanna I don't wanna let's let's  get back I think we deviated quite a lot  yeah  um so Muhammad says hi everybody I would  like to ask what is the best way to  become Cloud Solutions architect and  later Cloud architect starting as a  cloud developer  uh no sorry that's a question starting  as a cloud developer can be the right  way  um do you want to take a stab at this  updel or I'll let you answer the  question because you are an applicant  I'm not okay  um so  starting as a cloud developer can be the  right way starting as anything my friend  can be the right way  um  becoming an architect as you know going  back to abdel's point at the beginning  it's about experience  uh it's it's it really really really  really takes experience sometimes I'm  working with with teams and I'm working  with some super smart people and then I  would say something and they would look  at me and they're like oh dude you're  super smart I'm like no I just I have  experience I've seen this thing failed  before uh I've seen the way you're doing  it and you know I just been there done  that  um there's always that discussion  between hard work versus you know uh  experience versus intelligence versus  Luck versus whatever I think a big part  of being an architect is really  experienced because people look up to  you developers look up to you platform  people look up to you they they look at  you as someone who is there to guide  them and yes we can all gather and  Google stuff and figure stuff as we go  and build and fail and iterate but  having someone who done this multiple  times before it just gives you  that shortcut and I think a big part of  of the architect role is really that  especially that you're working with  multiple customers multiple type of  Industries you're solving multiple  problems and you can  you can  uh uh  bring all that everything that you've  learned together and then you know try  to make it work for that specific  problem that you're solving so being a  cloud developer is a good path why  because it will give you a lot of  experience about building developing  testing monitoring uh I you will learn  about what scales what doesn't scale you  will learn that writing fewer code is  better than writing ton of code this is  something you see between someone who's  experienced and someone who is a junior  like a Junior wants to prove themselves  they want to write call they take  ownership and they take pride in the  code that they write an experienced  person  want to write the fewer as fewer lines  of code as possible they know that more  code you write equals more bugs  potential bugs equals more test that you  need to do equals more risk to roll  backs more risk for failures and that's  why you see Technologies like serverless  for example serverless functions  and why the cloud took off is because it  allows us to focus it it doesn't have  election for us and  um so yeah so I would say  Stalin as a cloud developer is a great  way starting as a full stack developer  is a great way starting as a  um SRE devops slash platform it's also a  great way because again you're learning  about what how to scale containers when  to choose a serverless versus a VM  versus a container what type of  workloads you need to get as close as  possible to Bare Metal versus what other  workloads you can just use layers of  abstractions uh you're learning about  all this memory optimization how to  optimize cost like  at some point you gather all this  experience and then you're able to bring  it together and that's in my opinions  the architectural so that's why when  someone asks me as a beginner hey I just  graduate from school and I want to  become a socialist architect  I always want to say yes you can but  please don't be right out of school  because it's like you're putting  yourself in a fail in a path for failure  you wanna  it's like you're going to put that  architectural and you're going to start  making decisions and they're not always  going to be the right decisions because  yes you're smart yes you can learn yes  you can read yes you have GPT three yes  you can Google stuff but there's that  little bit of experience that you know  like everything else in life you need to  failure is part of it's It's how we  learn  and Andy Jesse has this quote  uh he says  there's no  there's no compression algorithm for  experience  and that's pretty much like what Winston  Churchill says uh or said you know you  can't have a baby in one month by using  nine women just some things just take  time and and experience is a big big  aspect of becoming a Solutions architect  or becoming you know an architect of any  position and you look at it also you  know we talk about tech that's  if we step back and look at a a building  Architects or or like a I don't know a  real life architect someone who really  designs the building so you see that  these people  they've been you know they start as uh I  would say uh uh  uh they they well first of all there's a  ton of studying that goes into  mathematics and physics and and and all  this kind of stuff but but also it takes  them a lot of time before making that  design that we remembered them with no  one makes a breakthrough  skyscraper at age 21 it really takes  time and it takes failure and it takes  learning and it takes doing a ton of  stuff because you know someone can  actually trust them into building this  pentagon or or this uh  sophisticated uh skyscraper in I don't  know Burj Khalifa or something like that  so you can start anywhere but you just  need to go through that path  uh in order to to get to where you want  yesterday  I mean all you said is is is is is is  correct just like I've done a little bit  of architecture work because I was  working in Consulting and also I was  working with customers and one of the  things that was I mean maybe this was  also your experience is a lot of times  people look at you as the ultimate seal  of approval for an implementation the  person that is gonna tell them yes this  is absolutely the right way to go even  if like there is no single answer to  every single problem but at least this  is not this this thing that you're doing  does not follow the patterns for failure  right because at least you're not doing  this XYZ I've seen your experience which  doesn't scale you're not using service  it doesn't work you're not you know  doing something stupid you're not doing  something  obviously stupid so so that's kind of  one and you can only gain this if you  have experience right you can only be  able to because even for you if somebody  says like is this good I mean if you  don't know if it's good you're gonna say  like I don't know right so if you have  that experience it's it's better and  it's better also to have aspiration for  I mean it's good to have aspiration to  become something it's good to have a  goal for your career it just just take  it one step at a time don't don't rush  it like these things takes time to to to  build to build the expertise takes time  basically that's what I'm trying to say  it does you have no idea how many times  in my career and I'm sure you've seen it  in your career where someone gets  promoted to a level where  they're not ready for and they're pretty  much just put there for failure like as  someone who is a developer and they want  to be a tech lead and you know a couple  of years and they get the opportunity  and the other take lead but then they  hit that wall and then you know there's  a high possibility that they would fail  in that role and you don't want to see  them in that failure you want to tell  them just take the time you just need a  little bit more time in your cure and  troll so when you get that promotion  you're actually ready for it and there's  this there's this principle I forgot the  name but it says that we all keep  getting promoted until we get the  ceiling until we hit a place to roll  yeah the limits right something also  super interesting you say that is about  responsibility people look up to you as  the ultimate seal of approval  because ultimately if things go Haywire  you are responsible yes you can't blame  someone else you are the one who signed  on it and it takes you need to be  you need to be really comfortable with  signing off on a project and knowing  that if this design fails I am the one  who's gonna be blamed for it I am like  you are the one who takes the hit it's  not your team if someone is good  your team takes the credit if someone is  bad you take the hits you know that's  but that's how responsibility goes in  all organizations responsibility goes  upwards and you see even like you see  this in the news  if there's a failure in an organization  you see the CTO for example stepping  down or you see the CEO stepping down  even if the CEO didn't even know about  what happened but responsibility moves  upwards and so you got to be able to  take that responsibility and sleep well  at night knowing that if this thing goes  bad well I am the one to blame and  that's why these things take time  uh as we've as we've been saying there's  a human aspect to everything we do yes  we are we have like we put the hats of  technologists and nerds But ultimately  we build stuff for people we work with  people uh we are people  um that that's that's like uh I've read  some critics about Optimus the humanoid  robots that this life is trying to build  you know to get the guy that was dancing  on the scene and because there's two two  School of thoughts there's the uh the  Boston Dynamics School of thoughts which  is pretty much we are going to design a  specific robot for a specific  environment that does a specific thing  so if you go to a car manufacturer  you'll see robots that are pretty much  one arm that moves something from here  from here and then there's the other  school of thought that says  we live in a in a world that is designed  for humans you know the the when we when  we drive a car the steering wheel is  designed for a human the chairs are  designed for humans the keyboard is  designed for a human so might as well  design a multi-purpose robot that can  live in our world and do stuff that you  know interacts with humans and stuff  like that so these these are two uh  lines or schools of thoughts but bills  ultimately  always keep in mind that we are building  for humans even you know when you're  when you're ux people for example they  they know that this button needs to be  this way because it's a human that's  gonna build on it there's like they do  phds in studying human behavior and  where the eye goes on on a specific  screen and you know there's even phds on  the amount of time  a keyboard should be responsive when you  like between the time you type on a key  and you see the letter on the screen  there's this goldilock Zone there's this  specific milliseconds latency because  more than that you would type on it and  then it takes I don't know a second to  see the uh the key on the screen you  just get bored and less than that it  would just feel super human that it  would seem natural so there's a ton of  things that we take for granted  but we design for humans and we should  never forget uh that we are building  stuff for humans uh very much and also  one thing you said which is very  interesting is like  as you grow in your career and you go to  more senior roles and potentially  Architects and and stuff like that you  have to be to know that you will have to  work with people so you have to be a  people person if you're not a people  person I think that a lot of people a  lot of time being Junior people they  just think that it's going to be in  their own bubble doing things and they  will only interact through GitHub issues  and jira tickets until the end of their  career and that's arguably not how  things work right if you're not a human  if you're not a people person if you  don't know how to talk and understand  and and and and and and interacts with  colleagues you're gonna have a very hard  time right I mean even if you look at  like most companies they have this like  you know career path for people who  doesn't want to do management right  typically it goes something like junior  senior staff senior staff you know  distinguish  um or you know something like that uh  principle this language engineer and  people when they look at the  distinguisher principal engineer they  say think oh that's like a superstar  engineer who's just writing code all day  which is arguably not the case at all  like they're just spending a lot of  their time writing documents and talking  in meetings and reviewing spreadsheets  and talking about budgets it's they are  not  therefore the technical abilities they  are not they are there for the  experience which allows them to help the  business people  stare the product the company in a  certain direction that they know is  going to work right like at Google at  Google Cloud as an example a lot of  decisions about building things does not  come from management and does not come  from product owners it comes from  Engineers it's our distinguished  engineers in the organization that goes  okay we think that this thing that we  think that based on the feedback from  our customers we have to take this  product in this direction or we have to  build this new thing or whatever right  and then that just a decision that  trickles down through the organ and  there will be products almost assigned  to it and Engineers assigned to it Etc  so but this especially through when you  work for a product company like you know  Cloud Google Cloud AWS whatever like the  the actual people making decisions about  what we should we build our Engineers  like yourself like like the people using  the product right  it's  our AWS I used to have weekly meetings  with service teams where I exactly did  this so I would I would meet with people  who built S3 or who built ec2 and I  would say hey here's what our customers  says they want to have an ec2 here's  what they want to have in H3 here's the  feedback like you bring that feedback  it's actually part of the job to bring  that feedback from the customers back to  the engineers and then as you said let  it trickle down and then it does that's  its all dance but pretty much that  feedback that that people  skills soft skills you know presentation  skills uh emailing writing email skills  you know all those are super super  important uh for the job  I I'm gonna let you go I'm really sorry  I I promised 45 minutes we are over an  hour this always happens when we I love  to talk to you  um let's just go I want to go through  the questions that we have that people  have pushed into the events so it's the  first one what kinds of jobs you can get  with the AWS Cloud practitioner  certification I think I I answered this  at the beginning  um so let me go to the second one  by Trevor for someone styling in the  cloud is it better to join an  established company or a startup  yeah I would say  um if you work in a startup you would  have more possibilities to try things  that even if you're working with  established companies because  established companies they are all about  and I assume here by established  companies I'm the person asking question  means customer the company is using  Cloud not producing it not the actual  Cloud providers yes yes  um I think in established companies it's  more about stability so the the ability  or their their their willingness to make  a change  um is is is is less than in a startup  because in a startup mode you're  probably already your footprint probably  is going to be smaller so amount of  resources you're going to consume per  month is smaller than a big company so  your ability is just change and try new  things would probably be better I would  say  yeah um that's it as a as a in a startup  you're putting more hats you're thick  lead you're the developer you're the  products you're Gathering feedback you  learn a lot more and the risk is low so  you can fail you can iterate faster as  an established company it moves a little  bit slower because there's already a  base there's all the recurring Revenue  you need to there's maybe Investments  investors whatever whatever so yeah I  would say when you start take more risk  it's like when you're in 20s take more  risk  we have another question so besides some  confidence boost  the information we learned during  preparation  I'm assuming he thinks about talking  about certification preparation that  saves a lot of time later  impressing most of the wrong people and  bringing you to the attention of some  good people what are certifications good  for we have a cynical  [Laughter]  what are certifications good for  um well my friend you are you are  underestimating the power of impressing  the right people yes I'm getting the  attention of the right people  um you know something I learned the hard  way  that I would say to a 19 or 20 years  young me myself is moved to Silicon  Valley move  you know the proximity to to where it  happens like you have to be where it  happens just I would have I would have  say take a job even if it means you're  paid a low salary but that gives you the  opportunity to sit next to someone who  builds great stuff who or go to lunch in  in a place where you know all this uh  where it basically happens so I think  impression like impressing the right  people it's really an underestimated  thing yeah it's a it's it's like if I  I don't know if I impress the Elon Musk  tomorrow and I don't you know I'm not a  fan of Elon Musk by any means but if I  impress that guy I'm sure you know that  would create open doors and so I think  you should you should you should think  about it that way as well  um also you can open doors for you uh  you know some recruiters would have  pretty much maybe they have a mandate  that says hire only someone who has this  certificate yes so you're putting  yourself for a success right uh right  there  um what what would you like to add up  there and I think I think also one thing  I'll add is that like I know that  recruiter is an HR do follow uh they do  care about certifications because uh  there are a lot of companies that just  publishes  um like every year there are  Publications around what's the best  certification or like how much money you  would make for a certain certification  like that there are the god the  gartner-like kind of Publications they  publish studies and they're not like  they're not fluff they do benchmarks  they look at how people make based on  which certification they have and they  publish these things and it's it's like  that's actually becomes a sort of  reference model for HR and recruiters  um and I know I know this for the facts  I know that people look into people  certified because they have read  somewhere that because this person had  this education this means that they are  they know what they're talking about and  therefore they are good to hire right so  it's not just impressing the wrong  people and and and and bringing your  attention to the right people it's  actually more impressive to write people  which is which is what you want  uh abdulfate says thanks for the  insightful stream uh going back to  experience points certifications in the  cloud are meant to show a practical  experience using the cloud so as  students is it to go for certifications  by studying for them uh tldr if a fresh  graduate has a cloud certification and  resume doesn't it Define the purpose of  certification  I agree 100 I think that  certification should just  prove that you actually know like take  all that experience and you know uh  prove it but you shouldn't use  certification to learn you should  actually use them to uh  show that you learned that you have  experience 100 agree if I was again the  advice for a student  rather than  go in and take a certification uh  participate in an open source projects  start to start up build a product even  if it fails no one cares you will learn  a lot of it yes yeah  and also because like those  certifications Cloud certifications are  becoming more and more scenario based  they are not really like like uh they  are just affect Bingo questions right  they're not like hey what's what command  you should type in the console to do X  they're more like this is this analogy  we're trying to achieve how would you  use this number of products to do this  right and especially the Architects ones  so yes  um so like even if you manage to pass a  certification as a student that doesn't  mean that you know things right and it  probably means you know the words and  they know what the words means but you  don't know how those words and how those  products actually fit in actual  implementation  it doesn't a certification in a  student's resume it doesn't have the  same weight as a certification in  someone in a middle or even you know or  at least someone who has professional  experience yeah I have a question for  you out there so this is for you how  important is CTA uh certification I  think that's kubernetes administrator  certification in the era of managed  kubernetes Services I think it's  it's kubernetes there is tons of  companies that self-manage their own  things  um are they massive like why do they  like pain  um many reasons I think one of the main  one is I mean it's becoming less and  less of a problem now because few years  back no one offered uh like manage  kubernetes in your own data center right  no one manage or no one manage at least  like no one give you like a a ready to  deploy kubernetes so you still have to  go and take the open source binaries and  deploy them yourself so you have to know  what you're doing right  um so now it's becoming more and more  with AWS Outpost which has a caseinate  or GK antos which has basically GK in it  or whatever Microsoft is doing  um so so so it's becoming more and more  like the the gap between your own Data  Center and the cloud is getting smaller  and smaller and also all the cloud  providers are expanding the footprint  they're deploying more regions in zones  or countries where they didn't had  regions before  um but for regulatory reasons and then  there is also this whole part of the  industry we don't see it as much which  is the the regulated Industries right  things like banks financial institutions  government security governments and  stuff like that which they don't want to  be on the cloud for many reasons so I  think it's is still very relevant but in  my experience when I took the  certification the cka it was just  relevant to understand kubernetes  basically and and know how to fix it  when it breaks cka is like 90  troubleshooting questions you just  follow your channel um it's it's a lot  of scenario based this thing is broken  fixed right and and again I went into it  just knowing like a bit of kubernetes  and a lot of things about Linux because  at the end of the day it runs on top of  Linux so if you know it looks it's it's  easy to to understand so yeah yeah  that's that was the use case for me when  I got cka it was just my customer wanted  to run kubernetes on their own uh they  were running like a hybrid model and I  they were my customers so I had to learn  how to troubleshoot kubernetes and  that's why I was I took the cka as well  um but now we have developers using this  managed kubernetes services and  deploying clusters and scaling them and  securing them and so uh I don't know how  to put the future yeah I'm gonna make a  prediction here I don't do this very  often in 25 years years from now there  will be a mayor of some City standing in  news conference asking for people who  know kubernetes because one thing we  don't we we're not we're very bad at  doing is we don't actually like we don't  think or we don't keep in the back of  our head that whenever new stuff shows  up there is always Legacy and Legacy  stays around like it's not it's not easy  to get rid of Legacy once you build  something because there was no solution  that could do it better for you and then  a new solution that would do it better  for you exists it's very hard to migrate  to it if you don't migrate your way that  Legacy will exist will remain right so  I'm quite sure that like  50 years from now you will be able to  buy a Google cloud data center stick it  in your own basements and have all the  services accessible to you and you will  still have customers with kubernetes  clusters I would I don't know man I  would I'm more Optimist I would say in  25 years  you would use some kind of neural link  thing to just send that send the  thoughts  to some kind of API somewhere that would  build this whole like you know you would  think about a website you want to build  a business and so it would generate the  website for you you generate a b testing  for you it would generate adverse like  write copywriting it would deploy it on  the cloud or whatever we call it maybe  we'll call it the moon at that point  because we'll figure out that hostile  stuff on the moon is cheaper than  hosting it here on Earth and because  it's cold we don't need to uh keep the  servers cool and and we reach we have a  new protocol that allows us to transfer  data you know  lights fast or whatever so yeah I don't  think we would have you know I don't  think we would because think about it we  we've been only doing this whole  computer science thing for maybe 80  years maybe 70 years it's still new you  know it's we're still teenage not even  teenager we're still like we're still  babies doing this thing so as we grow  and we get to the teenage phase and then  we learn and we become mature I think  this I think it will change uh like we  will not be making the same mistakes  because  yes we still struggle Banks still  struggle with this COBOL Legacy because  they didn't have the tools that we have  right now to migrate you know it was  mainframes it was  risky they didn't have this blue-grain  Canary stuff they didn't have cloud with  managed services so they had to just you  know if it's not broken don't touch it  don't fix it but I think going yeah  going forward I think the barrier to  move away from Legacy is getting uh  lower and lower and lower that's also  true yes that's also true especially  that's also most Cloud providers are  providing people with migration tools  they're they're working actually on  giving you a tool to migrate from one  thing to another I think I think  you know I would recommend that you  bring Jalal you know Jalal uh yes I  think I know he would yes I think he  should bring him here because you will  have a very good discussion about the  future I am more signal I have more  questions  I I had a discussion with him on Twitter  and I told him dude like we've I've been  hearing about no code for 20 years it's  still not it's still not here  he would probably be be very good to  discuss this topic of like what's gonna  happen in 20 years  right I'll I'll take a note of that yeah  and he's even much older than me and I  am more pessimistic than him which is  kind of funny  yeah okay great I'll I'll try my best to  bring him here on the pod  um anything else I think we're gonna  have to stop here uh I have other  questions for you other subjects for you  but I'm gonna keep those uh for the next  episode uh anything else you wanna you  wanna say to end this I think I think  I I think that we should probably over  all my recommendations just be  optimistic I think the future is gonna  look better than we think it's gonna  look and I think that because we are as  humans as I say always we are in our own  bubble looking at the world from our own  POV it's very hard to actually know  what's going to happen 10 15 years from  now 20 years from now right  um instead of just worrying about the  future I think we should just leave in  the moments and just you know it's gonna  be fine and there will be a recession  it's gonna be fine it will I'm really  optimistic I really think that  we will like climate change for example  I really believe in my hearts that we at  some point we will do all it takes to  stop it revert it I really believe I I  maybe it's candid you know maybe it's  naive but I really think that as humans  this this collective intelligence that  we have we will do the right things for  the future uh the future is gonna be  bright and they're gonna be no nuclear  war at least you know that's that's how  I wake up every morning I can't I can't  think of otherwise otherwise I'm just  gonna be depressed so I really hold to  these beliefs as humans we will do the  right things when the stakes are high we  will get together  um  yeah and so let's let's keep optimistics  focus on on the present yeah I just want  to add one more thing and this is  something I wanted to to talk about  earlier  um one one recommendation I would make  to people if you this is something I  started doing about a year ago a year  ago so here it is I'm advisor I'm a  technical advisor into startups uh  there's just two startups started by two  different companies friend of mine they  just reach out it's like we're gonna use  Google Cloud we need somebody who knows  Google Cloud it takes me one hour per  week plus a few another hours scattered  through the week just answering  questions on slack I do this purely for  zero dollars it's free work but I do it  purely for the reason that I want to  learn what they're doing they're doing  some stuff that are outside of my  expertise and it's purely for the  reasons that I get first-hand access to  information because I'm working with  Founders so if you have a senior if you  are a senior engineer and you have  enough baggage that you can share  um one other form you can share it is  just work with the startup have them  build things on top of something that  you you know framework a tool a  programming language a cloud provider  whatever you will learn tons of stuff  from there  all right on this bombshell Thank You  Adele great to have you as always thank  you everyone in the chat it's been  really great to have you here with us  and uh I'm sure we'll I mean now you  will be you will become a regular updell  uh I'm sure  all right have a good one thank you bye
