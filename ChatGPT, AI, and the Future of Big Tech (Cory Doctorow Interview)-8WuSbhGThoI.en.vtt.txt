 it's great to welcome back to the  program today Corey in my focus to say  his last name correctly I almost called  him Carrie Corey doctorow who is a  science fiction author activist  journalist and blogger his latest book  is choke point capitalism how big Tech  and big content captured creative labor  markets and how we'll win them back  particularly interesting now in the  context of all of the concerns around  tools like chat GPT and Ai and the  impact that they may have on Creative  labor markets maybe just to start  somewhere Corey we start there what's  your sense very big disruption coming  from these tools or maybe overblown  you know I I think that um as  interesting as the hypotheticals about  what will happen when these markets  mature and start taking away jobs from  creators yeah uh can be to think about  it's pretty speculative  um there there are elements of what GPT  does that and other ml tools I don't  like calling them artificial  intelligence they're neither artificial  nor intelligence uh but these machine  learning tools  they're also not learning but what they  do what they do uh sometimes amounts to  something that I think is um absolutely  legitimate and the kind of thing we want  to encourage which is thinking really  hard analytically about how art is made  and then making new art that's how I  became a writer uh and you know uh  irrespective of what tool you use to  make your art uh it will always include  some element of Automation and always  include some element of analysis and  making something new by analyzing the  things that came before you it that is  not just legitimate it's how art emerges  and you know one of the things that  we've learned and that choke point  capitalism tries to emphasize is that  when you have an enormous amount of  Market concentration right there's  there's five giant Publishers for giant  Studios three giant labels two Giant ad  tech companies one giant ebook an  audiobook company that that giving  exclusive rights to creators is not a  way to get them paid more it's like  giving bullied kids extra lunch money  you know if you have to do a deal with  one of those companies to go live then  they're just going to take whatever you  got and so you know not long ago there  were a slew of Music lawsuits over kind  of look and feel or groove of songs the  first one was a lawsuit over the song  Blurred Lines that argue that it just  sounded like a Marvin Gaye song yes if  there was any notes from a Marvin Gaye  song Rhythm from Marvin Gaye's song  lyrics from Marvin Gaye's coach you know  uh key changes or or chord progressions  but that it just in its totality sounded  Marvin gayeish and um the victory in  this lawsuit was kind of a uh heralded  in a mixed Way by both by record  industry Executives and by performers  um but ultimately I think you know with  three giant record labels uh if it does  turn out to be the case that there is  such a thing as a groove right and that  becomes well established in law it's  just going to become a feature of the  normal record deal that when you sign a  record deal you sign away your groove  rights and what that means is that whole  genres will become the property of three  companies and there's just going to be  no way to make new art without  submitting to whatever terms they demand  of you that would be the worst case  scenario of creating a new right to  control how people can make new art out  of what they've learned from looking at  your art now there's a much easier case  which is the plagiarism case yeah that's  where that's where machine learning just  coughs up whole sentences paragraphs  images figures from from other art  that's a lot easier that's just  copyright infringement uh in in the main  um but I think that even if they could  guard against that and and as a kind of  pretend computer scientists have an  honorary doctorate in computer science  um I can imagine a pretty easy way to  compare uh output from a machine  Learning System to training data from  the system and ask yourself is is this a  direct lift and if it is then you then  you um uh discard it and start over and  I think that even if that were happening  all of the concerns that people have  about creative labor markets would would  still persist with machine learning  images uh um words and so on if we step  back a little from the creative side and  content creators and talk a little more  generally on the one hand there are more  and more ways in which Computing  generally and by this we might be in  mobile devices Computing generally is  kind of integrated in every aspect of  people's lives jobs shopping travel you  know quite literally every aspect of  people's lives there is a maybe a  growing realization from some about the  power that big Tech has both in terms of  guiding people's choices and in terms of  data in all sorts of different ways  there's a growing realization I don't  know that it's really completely  widespread on and understood in the way  that maybe someone like you would would  hope people would understand what is the  direction of this in terms of what where  this is taking us as a 5 10 or 15 year  timeline yeah you know there's a kind of  Galaxy brain meme version of this right  where you know first you have this  inkling that some computer technology  some digitized element of your life is  adversely affecting you yes right and it  should be better then you realize oh  well this is pervasive across all of  society then you see some muscular  action taken in one corner and you see  it Ripple out across all these other  areas in unexpected ways so for example  um you know the copyright notice and  takedown system that was created in 1998  in the Digital Millennium Copyright Act  really changed the way that we do  copyright enforcement for the digital  era you know when I worked at a  bookstore if you thought a book on the  Shelf infringe your copyright you didn't  just get to march in and say take it  down right right you'd have to like get  an injunction and show evidence and if  it was frivolous you'd face penalties  now under notice and takedown you  literally just send a an email to any of  the intermediaries right so they can be  a payment processor it can be a cloud  provider it can be the ultimate  application provider like YouTube it  might even be an application an  application conduit like the app store  or the Google Play Store and you just  say there's some infringing material  here you need to take it down and by and  large that's what happens that turns out  to have all kinds of weird consequences  right you get cops who play Taylor Swift  songs when people try to video record  them in the hopes that YouTube's  copyright filter will automatically  remove the content yeah you get  reputation management companies that are  really just reputation laundry companies  there's one in Spain it's quite  notorious that works for convicted  torturers murderers human rights abusers  war criminals and it uses fake copyright  notices to make news articles about  their crimes disappear from the internet  you know and so this is the next stage  where you're like oh wait  we need to do this with care and then  you know for me the Galaxy brain stage  the part where you get to the where you  go oh wait there's like a way through  this is to say that  um all of the impediments to making good  evidence-based policy about tech do not  stem from Regulators merely being a  little clueless about technology  Regulators are capable of acquiring a  clue about technology there's no  microbiologist in Congress and yet we  all managed to drink our tap water  without dying of microbial illnesses but  rather that when an industry is very  concentrated you know when the web is  five giant websites filled with  screenshots of text from the other four  it's very hard to have an uncaptured  regulator every time you try to do a  proceeding everybody who shows up from  industry tells the same story even if  that story isn't true and you get kind  of Twisted and distorted regulation that  redounds to the benefit of those firms  and that's why we need to demonopolize  the internet and that's when you realize  oh wait Google is not a company that's  an idea Factory Google is a company that  buys other companies that have good  ideas Google itself has made one and a  half successful products it made a  search engine a Hotmail clone everything  else that's made and bought from someone  else or just copied from someone else  like Chrome which is based on some open  source code uh abandoned by Apple  ironically and and uh you know the the  um uh you know the the products that it  launched internally Google video Google  Plus and so on these all just crashed  and burned it it hasn't made a success  in-house so you know if we were to apply  antitrust laws as they were written  instead of as they've been practiced for  the last 40 years and just so you can't  buy your nascent competitors you can't  merge with major competitors you can't  acquire vertical monopolies you can't  collude with your competitors to rig  markets as Google and Facebook have done  with their Jedi blue program to steal  money from Publishers you know they're  not stealing your copyrights they're  just stealing your money uh that um you  know if we were to apply those laws then  we would have a very different  technology landscape and a lot of these  problems could be much more narrowly  focused we could say to a company that's  doing something wrong hey this is your  conduct remedy here's after you you have  to change your your ways and and clean  up your act rather than creating these  these policies that Ripple out through  uh these individual companies that  control so much of our lives so if we  step back for a second from the  antitrust and sort of regulatory piece  of this at the individual level is this  just like the ship has sailed in terms  of like unless you are quite literally  going to opt out of using devices  leaving any footprint on the Internet  it's just sort of like yeah I don't know  like using a VPN is not really going to  make a big difference here like is is  there anything that individual Behavior  even has as a role to play here so I  think that that in that we need to talk  about Monopoly again to talk about the  role of individuals because one of the  things that made Monopoly possible was  this ideology of consumerism and this  idea that it you that the way that we  make the world a better place is by  shopping carefully that your political  participation amounts to being an  ambulatory wallet uh you aren't going to  shop your way at a monopoly capitalism  but you never were going to shop in a  way that would prevent Monopoly  capitalism you know if you go down the  grocery aisle uh and um you pick up the  product that is a low packaging  alternative because you care about the  environment to some major product it's  going to be made by the same company  that makes the high packaging  alternative it's going to be made by one  of two companies you're gonna love her  or Procter and Gamble the two companies  that make almost everything in the  grocery store  and um if there was a product that was  successful against them if there was  like some local like dude and a leather  apron who is making hipster cookies and  uh everyone was buying them and they  became a runaway success uh either  Procter Gamble or Unilever would buy him  at yeah and they did they'd issue a  process release that said we bought this  company because we know our customers  value choice right well you you can have  any choice you want except for the  choice not to enrich the companies that  are doing bad things which means that  there is no choice for cleaning up  Society to clean up Society you have to  be part of a movement systemic problems  need systemic Solutions the second half  of choke point capitalism is a bunch of  shovel ready solutions that are quite  Technical and have no individual role  except for the role of making these part  of the ideas that are lying around when  crisis strikes because when uh things  that can't go on forever will eventually  stop and when they do there is the space  in which ideas that have been in the air  about how we can make contracts fairer  how we can make business Fair how can we  give individuals performers and workers  more rights that's when they come to the  force so you know for years people have  been talking about what we lost when  unionization went away  um as an individual you can't improve  the conditions of the workers at your  Starbucks but when a hundred Starbucks  moved to unionize because that idea is  in the air because the crisis is struck  then you as an individual have a role to  support the union they'll tell you how  they'll say here's our strike fund  here's the day that we don't want you to  you know we don't want you to buy  Starbucks gift cards this Christmas you  know they they will give you ways that  you can act as an individual as uh to  enhance the the action of a movement but  in the meantime what you can do is is  find out what the systemic problems are  talk about and socialize those systemic  Solutions and then be ready to deploy  them when the moment comes aside or in  addition to the Monopoly and antitrust  issues what else are the big big Tech  concerns to you in terms of you know fun  tunneling people into a uniculture or  whatever right I mean I'll just leave it  open what else should we be concerned  about so you know I wrote another book  uh that also has the word capitalism in  the title it's the season for those  books called how to destroy surveillance  capitalism yes and and it argues with  shoshana zuboff and her book uh in the  age of surveillance capitalism whose  core hypothesis is basically that ad  Tech is a kind of mind control Ray and  that uh while it might have been  invented to sell your your nephew fidget  Spinners it's been hijacked to make your  uncle a q Anon and that's where all of  this collapse and our support for our  institutions comes from it comes from  the persuasive power of AD Tech I don't  think that's true I think that you know  ad tech companies their their greatest  persuasive power is convincing people to  buy ads and that's always been the ad  industry's greatest power but I do think  that people's uh um confidence in our  institutions has collapsed because our  institutions are are not worthy of our  confidence right when the NIH lets  moderna uh um make an mRNA vaccine using  NIH patents without taking a license and  then doesn't step in to assert that  patent when moderna quadruples the cost  right uh and and Scoops up for itself a  four thousand percent margin on this  vaccine that was produced with 10  billion dollars in public money that  that is a reason to doubt the our  institutions and that monopolies pervert  our institutions and so you know to the  extent that ad Tech helps you find  people who are disillusioned it doesn't  not make those people disillusioned and  the way that ad Tech makes people  disillusioned is by abusing our rights  not by being persuasive but by for  example effectively blocking privacy  regulation which we still don't have on  a national basis in the United States I  I think in a world where we our privacy  is so comprehensively invaded so  frequently and so uh visibly when our  Regulators don't step in to give us a  privacy regulation then that that makes  the claims of conspiratorialists who say  that our our agencies are captured  shouldn't be trusted and so on it makes  them credible not because Bill Gates is  putting microchips in our vaccines but  because the agencies themselves haven't  earned our trust so that's I think the  main problem of of big Tech is that big  Tech makes the claims of  conspiratorialists credible which makes  it harder for us to rebuild our  institutions which we really need to do  lastly Corey you know you you are so  well known for issuing these  extraordinarily important critiques of  the system out of sheer curiosity do you  do anything at the individual level that  people might find interesting like you  you stick with an old flip phone just or  you know anything like that  no you know like this is the thing so  I'm not I guess the biggest thing is  that I'm a Zucker vegan I don't have any  Facebook accounts or Facebook adjacent  accounts I'm not on Instagram I'm not on  WhatsApp I'm not on Facebook I'm not on  Facebook Messenger but you know that  doesn't help at least or except at the  very margins because Facebook still has  a dossier on me all right apps on my  phone are built with Facebook sdks which  means that uh they're Gathering data for  Facebook uh and and and Facebook is  maintaining it  um you know I I there are only so many  hours in the day yes I am pursuing  systemic changes right and so if I stop  pursuing systemic changes to pursue  individual ones then I I'm gonna lose  efficacy there's a great bit at the end  of zephyr teachout's wonderful book  break them up about antitrust where she  says if if you spend three hours driving  around looking for a fair trade  mom-and-pop magic markers to make a sign  so that you can go to the strike against  to Amazon and you missed the strike  because you didn't want to buy your  markers from Amazon Amazon wins yes  right and so rather than taking these  meaningless individual steps at the  margins I try to take big step big  swings at the center uh you know that  said like with Arts artistic work  um I I try to buy it in the way that  gives the artist the most money so with  music that means when there's an artist  I love like most recently it was  Penelope Scott I go and buy their whole  catalog on bandcamp which does give  significantly more money to the artist  than listening to them on Spotify okay  interesting yeah I I agree with you  wholeheartedly about the broader broader  philosophy there um the latest book is  choke point capitalism how big Tech and  big content captured creative labor  markets and how we'll win them back  we've been speaking with the book's  author Corey doctorow always great  having you on really appreciate it  likewise it's a it's a great pleasure  nice to see you again David
