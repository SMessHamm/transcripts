 hey this is Meredith Elliott Powell and  you know what time it is it is 8 A.M  Eastern Saturday morning and time for a  sales logic I'm hanging out in the  studio today with my partner my  colleague Mark Hunter Mark we got a good  show today we got a great show we're  going to be talking about chat gbt and  the future of sales  and yeah I think it's going to be a very  stimuling because I got some interesting  information I'm going to reveal after we  start the show all right let's rock and  roll Prospect with Integrity we will get  customers who have integrity Integrity  is the foundation from which everything  is built on  [Music]  you better understand value  but at the end of the day sales is a  relationship business it is a people  business it is a emotional business  foreign foreign  logic  Meredith welcome back from Lithuania we  both made it back yeah we did we did  make it um we did make it back it's good  to be back in the studio and doing this  uh live from uh from the U.S so before  Mark Dives in and tells you everything  that's going to happen in the show today  I always like to start off and tell you  how the show works we kick off every  week uh with a question from you the  audience so we invite you we want you to  be a part of sales logic so if you have  a question join us here at  saleslogicpodcast.com just put your  question in there we've got a Hot Topic  we've got a book we recommend and a  lightning round and uh Bill and Jack  Hubbard have already joined us this  morning so Mark tell us what is on tap  for today well what's on tap is we're  going to be talking about chat and gbt  and the future of sales because I tell  you what this thing has just it's just  been like a tsunami that has come over  in the last three or four months  everybody's talking about it so we're  going to kind of talk through some  things I got some interesting  information I'm going to reveal that I  just uncovered in the last 15 minutes we  got a great question uh that talks about  the future that ask about the future of  sales we've got a great book in fact hey  mayor I actually did I I did a little  switch so the book I said we're going to  talk about no I changed because chat jbt  said I should go with a different book  so anyway so anyway hey let's jump into  the question the question today comes  from Henry in New York City he asked  everyone is talking about chat gbt and  how it's going to change everything is  this going to wipe out a large percent  of sales jobs  quickly no no we won't well we got to  start off by um by saying that it is it  is it is chat GPT p is in um p is in  Fall  um what was I saying was I saying chat  gbt yeah you're right okay yeah  wrong I haven't had enough coffee this  morning I'm sorry can you repeat the  question yes Henry in New York City asks  everyone is talking about chat gbt and  how it's going to change everything is  this going to wipe out a large percent  of sales jobs okay I can answer that  really quickly now  oh okay we end the show right there  right now yeah there it is there it is  you know what's funny I asked that  question of chat gbt and you know what  the answer came back the answer said no  the future  of sales is bright because it will not  be able to capture the personality the  empathy and the emotional insights that  a person can bring to it that came right  off the chat gbt just a few minutes ago  now yeah yeah go ahead well this what's  interesting I asked it twice five  minutes apart and I got different  answers oh does that sound like sales  people where they give no I won't say  that I won't say that  well I think the um I mean I think we  all know the answer is that no it's not  going to wipe out sales but it is going  to change it it um you know I was just  reading something uh yesterday on chat  gbt and they were talking about the fact  that it's going to increase our ability  to make calls to from like 100 a day to  which the top sales people make 100  calls to something like a thousand a day  but those are Robo calls they're not  authentic well well cultured well  crafted I think where it's going to make  a difference for us is it's going to be  helping us create content create  marketing pieces position ourselves as  expert but the authenticity the  connection and the expert value that the  salesperson brings to the role is going  to I think increase but as well as  anybody who is in sales right now who is  not positioning themselves as an expert  you're going to be left behind  I tell you what that is so the role of  sales people this is really no different  I see chat chat GPT coming on the scene  as no different than when Google search  came on the scene 15 or 20 years ago you  used to go to the library and do your  research then Along Came Google and all  these various search engines this is  just the next generation of it and just  as Google search did not replace sales  people this won't either but it's going  to put more of an emphasis on you the  individual the ability to create  authenticity the ability to be  transparent the ability to create trust  and do it with a level of Integrity this  is gonna really I think Elevate the  sales profession because we're also  going to have to spend time de-educating  customers because customers are what are  they going to do they're going to go to  the internet and well this is what it  says I should do and just as I came up  with two different answers  what is the future of sales  so two customers are going to come up  with different answers and we're going  to spend a tremendous amount of our time  deeducating but you can't de-educate  unless you've created an element of  trust because otherwise they're not  going to believe you because they're  going to trust everything it's set it on  the internet so it must be true yeah I  love what Larry Levine said here I find  fascinating is how this has become the  latest shiny sales tool for many in  sales I agree I mean just last week I  got four blogs from four different  people I follow and they were all on  this subject I mean it sort of has  become the Razer uh the razer-like focus  I'm fooling around with it but I really  haven't figured out how to use it in my  business I mean I know we we were  talking when we were in Lithuania that  one of the speakers we were there for is  using it to create content using it to  create videos I still like my own  authentic voice in um in those things I  get a lot more value out of writing than  just producing the a product it's how I  do my own research it's how I position  myself you know as an expert so be  curious as to how people are beginning  to integrate this in to and I wonder I  wonder if it's going to make uh  customers and Prospects less trustworthy  of the information they receive which  creates an opportunity for authentic and  original content See I think that's the  case because again there's going to be  this tsunami of information that's  coming over and and people are going to  be overwhelmed and the challenge is  right now people are like wow that's  what that's what it says so it must be  true but then you know what we begin to  dig into it just as I found this morning  literally three minutes apart three  minutes apart and I got different  answers so here's the question we have  to ask ourselves how do we use it now I  think it can help us in terms of just  stimulating some ideas because again you  know you're about ready to go in on a  sales call and do I have all that all  the issues on the table do I have  everything well let's just  let's just ask chat GPT and let's see  what it says because again it may help  us oh you know what I didn't cover that  one well enough I'm not prepared now so  I think it can give us a lot of  additional ideas it gives us an  additional tool you know  yeah I agree I mean I think that I love  what um Spencer Ripley says here use the  technology don't let it take over and  Jack Hubbard um weighed in I thought was  a really good suggestion that maybe it  can help us um plan better that maybe a  banker asks it to create some questions  about calling on a doctor and then the  banker can tailor those questions those  two comments back to back make a really  really great you know a really great  point is that start to use it  um but always weigh into it double check  it put it out there before  um before you uh you know before you use  it I don't know about you but I've  looked at a couple of people that have  produced some blogs from it I'm assuming  that those blogs are produced from chat  GPT because they come out and I don't  know it just sounds like it to me it  doesn't really sound like it's got  um that authentic voice and that  expertise the other is I kind of  wondered about you know an hour of  business and in the business of sales I  think one of them most important things  that we bring to the table are case  studies and stories and stories in case  studies I mean it's how I close almost  every deal right I mean the moment that  I hear that you know that this is the  situation I'll talk about  um a position I was just in I just did  it yesterday I was I was on with a  client we're talking about what to  present and I had just talked about a  presentation that I'd done in Houston  sales team was kind of in the exactly  the same situation and and I don't know  that chat GPT is going to be I think it  will present stories to it but if a  story isn't your own if it's not your  experience do you really relate it with  that level of emotion or confidence and  I think confidence is so big in sales I  mean one of the reasons I can convince  and close the deal is because I know  it's going to work I have the experience  from that and if I'm just lifting stuff  I don't know interesting I buy into that  100 because you are able to come in as  the authority you're able to come in as  the person who can share and think about  the story the story is not relevant if  you're telling somebody else a story you  know no no that the story is relevant  when it's your story applied to the  situation you're in so I I think I am  very bullish you know initially when I  first heard about this from our good  friend Ford sakes back back here a  couple months ago I was a little bit oh  but I've really come to embrace it and I  think it's going to help us as  professionals if you have a personality  now if you're the weird aunt or the  crazy uncle okay guess what this is  going to replace you or if what you sell  is basically a transaction well guess  what Google search pretty much did that  thing about the travel industry think  about many many things which we  typically buy just online without any  human interaction but for everything  else out there  it really increases the level of need  but go back to something that you said  because this is so powerful we now have  an assistant a couple people have put  this into the chat and I love this view  it as an assistant  because now I'm going in to a situation  maybe it's a maybe it's an industry that  I'm not super familiar with great here's  a great tool that I can use to help get  some insights and get up to speed a  little bit faster maybe I'm going into a  networking reception just as Jack said  you know you you're you're you're a  banker and you're sitting in front of a  doctor I can use this tool to help me  get  insights to get up to speed faster so I  I love what this I I love the tool  um I love what Keith uh Crawford said  here and helped me create a description  for my copywriting course I think if  that's a a great way to um to get  started back when I first started  writing books I would always have  trouble getting started and I would get  a couple of my friends together and I  would say can you know I want to write a  book about this kind of give me your  thoughts and it would gen it would sort  of stimulate me and get me going so what  you're talking about is using you know  chat gbt for for that you know part of  this show though today is about the  future of sales and the future of sales  is so much bigger than chat GPT that  just is is one little  um you know one little piece uh in that  and I really do think that the role of  the salesperson is changing and sales in  general is changing and chat EBT is is  part of that change and part of the  change is I think where the consumer or  the um or the buyer let me say buyers so  whether you sell b2c or B2B let me talk  about the buyer I think the buyer is  going to get more and more and more  overwhelmed  um just like with chat gbt do is this  authentic is it not authentic do I  believe it do I not believe it and I  think what we are going to become is a  gatekeeper of having of understanding  and being able to navigate helping our  customer members navigate the right  choices for them it's kind of like you  know I heard somebody say when the  internet was invented it was like  walking into a library and somebody had  just taken the Dewey Decimal System and  thrown it all over the floor and how in  God's name do you navigate when the  Dewey Decimal System has been I just  dated myself I do know that was thrown  all over the um was all over the floor  well I sort of think that's what's  happening in sales today is that the  consumer stands there and they're so  overwhelmed with Choice it's too much  and your job is to be able to go in and  figure out what the actual problem is  which sometimes they don't even know and  then help them say here's this massive  library of choice you have I'm going to  help you really do this very quickly  we're almost like the Google search of  sales see and that's where it comes back  to we have to create that element of  trust with the customer with the buyer  because if we don't treat if we don't  develop this element of trust with the  buyer how probably and that's why I like  to use the term de-educate because I got  I gotta D because they're just  overwhelmed  and yes Dewey Decimal I haven't heard  that term in years I'm sorry no it's  great I love it I can't believe I  thought of it yeah it's okay I I'm  looking right now at the racks of cards  that you used to go to in the library  anyway okay I'm sorry  we'll get back here's the situation  though we have to de-educate our  customers because again you know we  always hear that you know the studies  say you know the consumer is 65 of the  way through the the buying process  before they reach out to a salesperson  with chat gbt I think it could go to 75  or 80 or 85 but that's going to create  more problems for the consumer not for  the salesperson not for us we are in a  good position if we create this level of  trust so what is this going to mean this  means that we're going to have to have a  broader reach than ever because the  challenges  to be able to find these customers at  the right moment  when they're ready for us to come in and  de-educate them so I mean you know go  back to your comment earlier you know  can you use chat gbt to send out a  thousand emails 10 000 emails yeah you  can oh man can you imagine how  overwhelmed our inboxes are going to be  yeah they are  but again that means we have an even  bigger responsibility  because we can't we can't allow  customers we have to go into this with a  level of Integrity we can't allow  customers to make a bad decision and  that's what they have the potential of  doing if they rely solely on the  internet and solely on tools like chat  GPT  so so number one I think as salespeople  we're going to need to figure out the  technology and we need to dictate where  the technology fits and how how it can  best be utilized for ourselves and for  our customers and I love the fact that  basically use it like an assistant we  have to um position ourselves as the  Navigator the other place that I think  the future of sales is is is changing  but is going to become even more  dominant is there will be no line and no  Silo anymore between marketing and sales  while companies will continue to have a  marketing division or maybe you have a  business like Mark and I have businesses  and you're kind of a one-man operation  but you have people who support your  marketing efforts you have to hold  marketing yourself marketing has to be  your first step because again if people  haven't heard of you and they haven't  heard about you  um you know uh then then they're not  going to choose you I want to add to  that and then I'll let you jump in mark  though you have to be putting content  out there that is relevant and that  matters the very fact that I got four  blogs last week from speakers in the  industry which is the industry I'm in on  chat gbt it just tells me  people it's it it's it just is like  Larry said chasing the shiny object you  know it just I didn't read a single one  of them because everything looked  vanilla everything looked the same to me  so how are you going to be getting  content out there to build your  reputation that's different that's  unique that's Innovative that's relevant  that's going to get read but see that  means at the top of the funnel the  prospecting phase we have to be  different in how we come across because  again like you said it came across as  vanilla so we've come across I want to  shift gears here for a bit because think  about this  chat GPT has the impact of changing the  writing of marketing copy has the impact  for changing customer service you think  about customer service and and FAQ  questions and so you know wow it's an  amazing ability that this is going to be  able to do a lot to really help customer  service so I think there can be some  changes and shifts  in in total number of jobs in customer  service or marketing services or some of  that but I think again those who Elevate  themselves to the next level to know how  to use it and leverage it will benefit  dramatically from it this is again no  different than what we saw when Google  search and and every you know everything  else before that came on the scene again  this is just the next Evolution yeah you  know I got to admit I hate FAQs and I  hate that chat box that won't give me um  a person and I do think that it's going  to create more of that of trying to get  the customer to help themselves I got to  put Larry Levine's comment in here  because it's freaking it's freaking  brilliant it's brilliant and he's so  right my concern will become those sales  people who lean into this too much and  allow this to take over their thinking  will stunt their conversational  competence  um I'm you know we'll have the rest of  that in the show notes but  conversational confidence you know okay  let's leave that as a negative but talk  about your talk about your opportunity  you know sales people who can thank  sales people who can deeply go into  um into a conversation that is where the  opportunity is going to be in in the  marketplace and you know Jack Hubbard  you'll you'll appreciate this it reminds  me of being in banking when they did  centralized underwriting and all of a  sudden everybody opted out of whether  qualifying somebody for a loan or not  wasn't my problem centralized  underwriting was doing it people will do  the same with that GPD this is what it  said  you know to say now that's going to  probably be where the bulk of the market  goes where your opportunity is is is to  continue to be really good at the  conversation really good  um uh at engaging and you're right  exactly Ann McNeil  um I love and talk about a brilliant  woman in the area of business in sales  the cream will rise to the top and it's  the people who are not going to fall  victim to this it always does and again  just as we're having this conversation  we're interacting I don't know what  you're going to say next you don't know  what I'm gonna but what are we doing  we're having an an intelligent  conversation at least some people would  some people would think so anyway but  you can't do that and this is the  problem that chat gbt if we rely on it  too much is going to dumb down sales  people because we're going to try to get  into this rote process that we just go  boom boom boom boom and you think about  all like you said those bad emails that  we're getting those add blog posts we're  getting those all that type of stuff  this has the ability to literally take  that to the next level and and man this  this to me is kind of like fast food in  the industry yeah you can feel your  belly but let me tell you something  you're going to be in pain a few hours  later so yeah um Jack Jack thanks so  much for sharing the article he said  it's one of the best that he's read on  chat gbt kind of help see is Jack not an  excellent sales person I'm sitting there  Googling I'm getting so many articles  that I don't know what to believe Jack  cut through the chase sent me the good  one this is exactly what we're talking  about sales but we'll make sure that  that's in the show notes Forum uh  everybody and uh Mark we are burning  time and I've got to do a virtual  presentation yeah well let's talk about  the book the book the book Victor  Antonio and James Glenn Anderson has  written the book sales X Machina and  I'll tell you what this this is this is  a this is the most simplistic book  on AI came out a couple years ago and  what I like about it is he really  explains how AI Works in a sales world  so this this book by Victor Antonio and  let me tell you something the guy's  great he's got an MBA an electrical  engineering  um and and James is brilliant too so but  it's written in plain English that  anybody can understand so absolutely  great book again we're going to put that  in the show notes along with much of  much of these notes here hey  what are your thoughts should we go to  the lightning round yeah I want  before we do is the fact  it reminds me  and that is that I think the bulk of  this show has been very much about  embrace the technology that's um that's  coming along this is sales enablement  it's the things that are going to allow  you to gather information as Jack said  get questions or thanks but at the end  of the day it is your human factor your  skill your wisdom your expertise that  you're going to lay on top of it it's  not an either or it's an integrated  approach and I think the biggest message  to take from this show today is that the  future of sales is bright but it makes  us more valuable  um as salespeople and calls us to a  higher level of expertise I I totally  agree with that 100 I mean I I there is  so much upside to what we do because  again this is going to be an assistant  this is going to help us this is not  going to replace us if if as Ann McNeil  said the cream rise to the top so if  you're part of the cream you're in a  good position hey with that let's jump  to the lightning around 10 ways to use  chat GPT right now I'm going to steal  Jack Hubbards I would I love this idea  of going into a sales call and asking  some questions of it  I I love it two use it to help you do  some research before you go meet the  customer this is just an additional  source for you yeah I would I would look  into it to figure out what the biggest  challenges are in the industry what the  biggest Trends are what are the things  that you need to know  use it to acid test your presentation  before you go in you've got talking  points you you want to say go see what  chat GPT is saying it picks up a little  bit on what you just said yeah find out  who the competition is in the  marketplace and what their value  propositions are  do not allow it to replace you do not  allow it to become your sole source of  thinking your personality your intellect  your intelligence is still the greatest  tool out there yeah I'm going to steal  Keith Crawford's idea of you know kind  of getting you stimulated uh to write so  giving you some ideas to get off the uh  you know to get off the ground  I'm going to add one more and you add  more one more and we'll close it down  use chat GPT as a learning Source not to  replace long-form reading books books  books are still absolutely essential but  use it to supplement to help you learn  yeah I would say to use it to um to  begin to plan your presentations to uh  get some good ideas of a way to open for  a presentation or solve some of the  biggest challenges  um you know that that you're thinking  about as you're gonna gonna um interact  uh with your with your client hey with  that it's time to say thank you for  listening
