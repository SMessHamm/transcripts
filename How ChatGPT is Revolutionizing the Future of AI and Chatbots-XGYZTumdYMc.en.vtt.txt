 foreign  getting their mind blown with this new  chat GPT technology are we getting a  glimpse of the future well stick around  to find out is man still the most  extraordinary computer of all John F  Kennedy used to think so but things are  rapidly changing chat GPT is dominating  the internet and is the hottest Tech  topic right now what's most interesting  about this hot trend is the people's  reaction to chat GPT and who these  people are these are not the people who  get excited by every shiny new thing  that comes out if they are this excited  then clearly something big is happening  so what is chat GPT chat GPT stands for  chat based generative pre-trained  Transformer it's a powerful natural  language processing tool developed by  open AI it's capable of generating  human-like text-based on a given input  natural language processing lets virtual  assistants like Siri and Alexa  understand that when you ask Siri play  some rock Siri understands that you want  to listen to rock music after playing  around with it for the last few days it  was easy to understand that using it  effectively will become a must-have  skill for engineers knowing how to  communicate to AI interfaces properly  will become really important in the  coming years in this video we'll explore  how chat GPT is already disrupting  content creation and software  engineering as we know it as well as  some of the threats it brings  1. source of inspiration for writing by  providing a few seed sentences or  keywords chat GPT can generate text that  can serve as a starting point for a  story article or other written work this  is great because it can help writers  overcome writer's block and kick-start  their creative process here's an example  of what this could look like I asked a  chatbot what types of companies will  benefit the most chat GPT four main  types of business came up  a retail chatbots can handle customer  queries freeing up human customer  service representatives to focus more on  complex time  B Healthcare chatbots can provide  patience with information about their  medical conditions treatment options and  appointment schedules  c financial services chatbots can assist  customers with account management and  balance inquiries freeing up human  customer service  D e-commerce chatbots can assist  customers with product recommendations  order tracking overall customer  experience and increasing customer  satisfaction in general companies can  benefit from GPT technology by reducing  the workload on human customer service  and improve overall customer experience  what makes this even better is that chat  gbt remembers the whole thought process  or basically the whole chain of thoughts  that you had with it back and forth and  this is really powerful so next up I ask  what gpt's main limitations were I  wanted to see where the conversation  would take me and this was the answer  1. lack of understanding chatbots are  not able to fully understand the context  and intent intent is the spicy word in  this answer  2. bias chatbot can exhibit bias due to  data they were trained on HM this makes  one start to think  three limited domain knowledge chatbot  may not understand specific domains or  Industries so their answers may not be  accurate or reliable  4. difficulty handling novel input GPT  May struggle to generate appropriate  responses to novel input that falls  outside of the patterns and structures  present in the training data in general  chatbots can be useful in providing  information in a natural and human-like  way but they're not a replacement for  human judgment and understanding this  point is interesting because we can  start to think that man still stands a  chance Against the Machine  I then wanted to ask about the jobs this  technology can generate everyone else's  focus on what jobs are being replaced so  why not focus on what can be created  according to the GPT this is difficult  to predict but it still gives us some  answers so the use of natural language  processing powered chatbots may lead to  the creation of new jobs in chatbot  design and development as well as the  management and maintenance of these chat  boards it may also lead to the  transformation of existing jobs now  remember in the last Charlie and the  Chocolate Factory movie with Johnny Depp  where Charlie's father was first fired  from his job as a toothpaste cap Placer  because the company bought a robot for  the job and there was high back to  repair that same robot well something  like that is what will happen here  2. collaborating with the tool creatives  could also use chat GPT as a  collaborator by providing input and  feedback writers can use it to help them  develop their ideas and expand on their  work it's just a great back and forth to  explore ideas  three experiment and testing chat  creatives could use GPT to experiment  with language and style chat gbt can be  used to generate text in different  voices this could be a useful tool for  writers who are trying to develop a  unique Voice or who want to explore new  writing styles I've actually used GPT  chat a lot for this video I had the idea  about what I wanted to write about and  how I wanted to connect the dots and I  let GPT chat to do some of the dirty  work of course with some fine tuning to  make it fit my style and adding more  thoughts of my own this in my eyes is a  revolutionary and disruptive approach to  content generation water content writing  and creating in general I believe the  impact of this cannot be overstated  we'll talk about the threats to all of  this but first let's talk about code so  until now we've just covered content now  let me show you how chat GPT will  disrupt software engineering it seems to  have taken over the entire internet and  particular my Twitter feed people are  asking questions and are feeling  concerned and excited after seeing it  with my own eyes I understand why this  is said to be the new coding Revolution  things as crazy as converting a PHP app  to next.js just by pasting the code and  telling GPT to do it I've been  incredibly impressed and I think that  many of these tools will change the way  developers do their work I don't think  they'll replace developers someone has  to work with a chatbot and who better  than developers to do so is just crazy  how it can write JavaScript code that  generates the Fibonacci sequence or  simple everyday starflight redoing the  navigation bar on a website and you can  just paste the generated code into the  header of your website I can also show  you an example of our blog where now  many of the blog posts are created with  AI and even some of the images were  generated by AI these are the tools you  need to play with if you want to stand  out if you're good with computers you  can pretty much do anything you just got  handed a new insane tool which is free  to use at least for now understand it  and you have an advantage start reading  about it and in two years you may be  average ignore it and for the next five  years you'll probably be very left  behind  remember we mentioned the threats this  technology can bring  one the real danger is not that  computers will begin to think like men  but that men will begin to think like  computers loss in critical thinking and  creativity one of the downsides of  Technologies like gpt3 is that they lack  critical thinking and creativity because  they can generate text based on a set of  inputs it can make it easier for people  to produce content without having to put  much effort or thought this could lead  to a situation where people rely too  heavily on tools like these and as a  result their own critical thinking and  creative skills begin to deteriorate  2. fake information another threat is  that GPT 3 chat and other similar  Technologies can be used for nefarious  purposes such as generating fake news or  impersonating others online which can be  harmful to individuals and society as a  whole  three the AI is not always right the  chat may give the wrong answer because  of man's trust in the machine wrong  information will be living in the  internet as facts we saw this on Twitter  when someone asked the chatbot who's the  fastest Marine Mammal and the answer was  the peregrine falcon a bird the person  and the Machine had a whole argument but  the AI just apologized and delivered the  same wrong answers 4. and the last  threat is the impact on employment we  talked about this before I don't think  this will replace anyone but rather  create jobs but this is a point many  fear so I decided to point it out here  I guess the real question we have to ask  ourselves is Will creative work be done  by ai2 we're grateful for AI to automate  simple tasks and free people so they can  focus more on complex and creative tasks  but it seems like creative tasks are  also being done by AI sure it's just  pattern matching basically but human  brains work that way too our thoughts  are influenced by our experiences I'm  still very optimistic because as  machines become more and more efficient  the more man will become Innovative the  more we'll be interacting in machines in  ways that we can't even imagine  foreign
