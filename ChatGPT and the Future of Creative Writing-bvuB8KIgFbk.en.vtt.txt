 Hello, welcome to my video this time, in this video, we will discuss discussing it again, discussing it again, we will play in CBT with the topic Creative Writing. first at open ai.com, after signing up, you can use the paint feature like this, then you just have to log in to the Open chat, ya.com, log in and then you can immediately use the features. related to creative writing, later we will play with several types of literary works, yes, prose poetry, then maybe we will also do a little bit of a movie script, maybe, yes, we will see how well Cat CBT can handle my ego, let's challenge it, can we do that or not?  we made it. He helped me make some literary works, right? Once again, friends, to remember seb's question  Not yet. If not, if the questions are still related, then in one Trap, you don't need to reset it, just let it connect to become one unit, that's all we have to do [Music] just keep going, let's start with Creative Writing for poetry, let's see if you can make me poetry like that, please, so that it's polite 19, it can be cultivated, it can be made by a charge, something like this, if we ask for it again, yes, imagine we can make a book like that, right, a compilation of poems on this topic, but maybe we don't write the poetry, but we genre it through  This CVT is terrible on one side, it's terrible. So maybe we need further discussion about the future of Creative Writing with this, because there are some people who talk about proper review and revision, so even the ternit-in can't check the results of this or that.  some say one of them is for essays so it 's worth watching out for By  because it's actually interesting. We discuss it so we can know we can see where we are, especially if friends teach courses or pursue pursuits on the topic of creative writing or creative writing, whether at school or at university, and we can give students assignments  we can make poetry with a certain topic, we can make what's called, we can make poetry like that, so we really have to think about how this squeeze can affect the teaching e-learning process that occurs in creative courses, for example because it can because it can be made just for  I continued to write poetry like that, so I asked to make a new poem, but the topic was still students live and covid. After a while, please, the poem will repeat itself in several parts. It 's because he did it after how many times, what is the name of how many times the results of the poem were made?  by caci pipi k  then when we ask to make it again, the result will not be very new, the quotation marks, so there are several parts that are then repeated in several parts of the poem, that's what I experienced, that's what I feel for the poem, so, after 5 or 6, the seventh poem and so on genred by the cbt cat, there will be a number of stanzas, there are several others that are repeated like that, so it turns out that it's not not very new, so our expectations are 100 new poems, yes, it's original, it turns out it doesn't really, it doesn't really. uh, what's the saturation level called for each type of literary work, yes, for each type of creative writing, what's the saturation level in poetry, I think it's at 56 or maybe 10, maybe it's different, right, but there's a fact after how many times it's been generated?  the name of this cacivity poem will produce results which are then relatively the same as  the previous results are like that, for example, for example, if for example the task is only to paint once like this, it is very, very helpful for our students or students to answer or do the assignments we give, so yes, we need to discuss this. After this, I think we need to make one  the session itself, that's about academic integrity, that's recording this new invention because you can really make it, you can make it visually, it's pretty good too, that's just poetry, now we'll see short stories, short stories, please, sorry. Please read the short story about the Indonesian student stragling with in us Universe at home, for example, like that, for example, if you add to it, we add Ivory, let's see if CVT paint can make us a short story about Indonesian students who are strategic with the United States, named Risang, let's see what friends can see for themselves  so it's actually a bit confusing like that  n this video because if later this is watched by students or students they will practically use it like that to make their assignments but actually or later like that they will find it anyway so we just have to think now with the ability to paint CVT as good as this I like  This Advance What should we do? Previously I used this feature. Chrome was like that before making the video like that and the results generated twice twice, both were good. The previous one was also good. This one is also good because for me, I often face Raya like that  This could be one of the strategies to break down the Creator Vlog, so we just have to continue with the story, or if we're too lazy, that means there are too many slices, just ask for the charger, please, let's see if CVT paint can continue this short story.  so can we add it continue the story with about L  ove Triangle can I or not I will title this video cat CVT and the future of gratification because it turns out that even though we add likes, we can still accommodate demand.  all that's left is to make a few from and then from that I'll put it in a pinch to make me a story. This is an interesting topic that we have to discuss, that's for short stories, right? It's true, we can make a novel using CBT paint, maybe sometime we need to make a project, that's how it is.  a novel like that, maybe it will sell, maybe maybe the story isn't that good, the question isn't good or you can't make it, you ca n't, the answer is yes, then nuggeting is what we have to founder, so we reflect together, how far can we use clip-on paint, if we  could find this feature if i could find  If you can find this website, fellow students can definitely find it, so what we need to discuss together is what should we do? already given an idea to make a film called forensic now there is already a synopsis of the film make a movie Script 10 Minutes movie S very interesting I asked to make a 10 minute script based on the synopsis earlier which was made based on the short story earlier I was always amazed like that Every time I entered  even though I've tried it before making a video, I'll try that first, I'm sure I can try that, but that's how it is. Every time I try, the answer is always different and the answer can always amaze me. What else do we want to make? short stories can be extended from short stories and novels i  we ask to make a synopsis of the film, can we ask for a synopsis of the film to be made, moreover, I'm also confused as to what the limits of this cat jpt are, but for me it's Beyond What I have expected, right from technology, that's it, okay, let's stop the video first, I'll let my friends  -Friends playing for the topic of creative writing, in this video we discuss the CBT paint service for making short story poetry and movie scripts and movie synopsis, the results are smooth, smooth and good, you can do everything, so friends, please try it, if friends are interested in the world of creative writing, please try it  and compared to that, maybe the result will be a little more robotic, like a machine. But if the answer is yes, we can't, we ca n't, we just have to see the result, we'll just have to judge for ourselves, but it's cool, friends, please try it if anyone wants to be a film director  it's short, campus assignments, so the next video we're going to play  in with a presentation maybe yes How to prepare a presentation We were told to make a presentation We were told to make material We were asked to make a presentation script Can we do the next video or not, we just have to play via CVT video chat see you in the next video please friends play with a CVT charge Enjoy it while it's still  beta and later you can feel the interaction with Cibitung paint.
