 Google future is in danger  do you know Google search will might be  replaced by chat CPT but how  welcome to Gates explore let's start  today's video  [Music]  in today's video we will discussing GPT  and Google to reading search  technologies that are saving the way we  find and access information online  first let's define what we mean by GPT  and Google  Liberty or generative pre-training  Transformer is the type of language  model developed by open AI that is able  to generate human-like text Google on  the other hand is a search engine that  allows users to search for information  on Internet by entering keywords and  phases  now let's compare these Technologies  one key difference between GPT and  Google is the way they process and  understand language CPT is streamed on  large database of human generative text  and is able to generate text that is  similar to how a human would write it  Google on the other hand uses algorithm  to understand and the process search  friends but it is not able to generate  text in the same way that GPT can  another big difference is the way these  Technologies are used if it is primarily  used for generating text while Google is  used to searching for information on the  internet  however as we mentioned earlier  because potential be used to improve  search engine in the future by  generating natural language summaries or  description of web pages or by  understanding the intent behind a user  search query and providing more relevant  result as examples chat GPT chat GPT is  the latest version of GPT  where we search anything and it gives  result more relevant  despite these many differences both GPT  and Google are powerful tools for  finding and accessing information online  gpt's ability to generating human-like  text makes it useful for a wide range of  applications including language  translation chat board and content  creation whereas Google search engine  which is vast index of green pages and  sophisticated algorithm is a go-to  resource for millions of peoples around  the world  in conclusion GPT and Google are two  leading search technologies that offer  unique capability and are shaping the  way we find and access information  online while they have some differences  both are valuable tools for finding and  accessing information on the internet  but we cannot deny it from the fact that  chat GPT will have the potential to  overshadow the Google search for more  information you can read my article the  link is given in the description below  thank you for watching if you enjoyed  this video and learned something don't  forget to give a thumbs up and subscribe  our channel for more informative content  [Music]
