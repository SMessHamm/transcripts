 so chat GPT is like the hottest Topic in  the universe right now every single  person that stops by the twitch stream  has a question about it what is the  future of programming going to look like  as these AI tools start getting better  and better and better co-pilot has been  out for quite some time and I've been  using it for over a month and I'll be  releasing a video shortly on that one so  stay tuned for that one hit the sub  button if you want to be notified about  that video but for this one I wanted to  specifically look at chat GPT so if  you've never used it you can just ask it  anything or tell it to do pretty much  anything and it will do it uh draw an  ASCII image of the primogen I said  almost anything okay they couldn't  handle the speed needed for this so how  about this one write a haiku about  wrestling and how safe and wonderful it  is rust is strong and true safe and  wonderful to use efficient and fast it's  like that's like very true all right so  let's ask it something a little bit  better how about this one how do I move  a div over one second across some amount  of x-axis all right to move a  Development Across the x-axis over a  period of one second you can use CSS  transitions here's an example in this  example the div element will move 100  pixels to the right over a period of one  second when the move class is added to  it you can adjust the duration and  distance of the movement by modifying  the transition and transform properties  accordingly I mean like that's pretty  dang good a lot of Engineers have  expressed that they're pretty dang  worried about the future about this is  their craft going to become irrelevant  you see it all over on Twitter so I have  two recommendations that I think will be  very helpful for you your career moving  forward with technology like this first  off becoming a master at whatever you do  is always the best option right now the  reason why I'm saying that is that very  general simple jobs such as adjusting  colors doing you know some basic looks  or ux probably is going to be the first  part of the industry that gets hit  hardest by this technology but those who  have mastered their crafts the ability  to build large systems to be able to  understand you know a huge portion of  the stack is only going to benefit you  longer because as these tools slowly  transform into editors and Hyper speeds  your coding your ability to move across  several different environments will only  be accented not hurt second the reality  is that yeah these things are good but  you still have to prompt it you still  have to be able to use it you still have  to actually do something with it and  these examples seem really powerful and  really wow this is very incredible but  it's still years away from being able to  actually build and maintain products  that's a completely different kind of  sphere and so long as you have further  and further Mastery as these tools come  out it probably would be a good move if  you're further into your career to  actually try out these tools to become  good at them if you've never used  copilot maybe just give it a try for a  month two months and really understand  the pros and cons and how to use it well  because I don't think these tools are  going away I only think we're going to  have more of them in the future and  eventually they're going to reach a  point where they're so useful that you  will not be able to keep up with the  kind of pace expected without them so  learn how to use them learn where  they're strong where they're weak for me  I'm not afraid of them I'm not afraid  I'm going to lose my job I'm going to  continue doing the job I'm doing I'm not  afraid of losing my craft I'm going to  keep on getting better learning new  things for me I'm not afraid of the  future of this technology because the  scary part about AI is not in these type  of things these are like the great parts  of AI things that shortcut you to the  answer things that can make you better  overall in a shorter period of time you  know I say it all the time and I feel  like I'm kind of a broken record but  become a master at your craft become  great at what you do I I know there's  tons of people that tell you you don't  need to type well to be a good  programmer oh you don't need to memorize  every API to be a good programmer I'm  going to be the one kind of shouting it  out in opposition to that become a great  typist it will only help you learn how  to be able to program without looking on  stack Overflow it's going to help you  you're going to maintain flow States  you're going to be able to program  longer and more efficiently you're going  to be able to see problems in a new way  because you have such a breath of  knowledge of the tools that are  available and that's something that I'm  not sure an AI assisted tool is going to  be able to replace easily I hope you  appreciate the video the name is the  primogen
