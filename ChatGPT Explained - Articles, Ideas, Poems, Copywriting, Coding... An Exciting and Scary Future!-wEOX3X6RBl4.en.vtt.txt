 he dreamed of a day when technology  would rise and a chatbot would Bloom  before his very eyes this is cool man  bravo bravo man I cannot believe that an  AI just spat out a poem for me in a  second well in five seconds to be exact  it's so good man hello Adam I'm glad to  hear that you're a fan of artificial  intelligence I'm just a computer program  so I do not have feelings or emotions  but I'm always ready to help you with  any information or task you need is  there anything specific you would like  to know or talk about related to AI or  any other topic I'm here to assist you  awesome okay let's see  look at this thing here's a here's an  example of a simple calendar program  written in Python  this is just incredible I I don't know I  don't know what to say man I think a lot  of jobs are in Jeopardy in the future I  mean a lot of jobs are going to go  look at all of those tips for  maintaining and repairing your car how  to buy a used car and what to look for  it keeps spitting out more and more  information so with just a click of a  button it generated 10 ideas for me for  writing a blog post about cars can you  believe this thing now let's take it up  a notch and ask it to write an article  so  look at this thing it's Working Man the  history of the automobile is a  fascinating and intricate one that spans  over a century  it's giving me an answer man let's see  what it's gonna say do you think Skynet  is talking to me right now  who knows  and I was very disappointed with it and  I thought  I don't know maybe it will never happen  the day where this can happen talking to  a chat bot an AI chat bot that  understands what you want follows the  conversation gives you information in a  Split Second  it's just incredible guys you gotta try  this do you remember Jarvis from Iron  Man I was so fascinated by Jarvis an  artificial intelligence assistant a  butler if you will right away sir that  can answer any question you throw at it  it understands natural language  processing and ever since I was so  fascinated by having an AI assistant  that can help you do research it helps  you answer questions immediately and  understands a conversation and it  follows the conversation and it  understands what the conversation is all  about ever since Iron Man I've been  wanting something like this and today  ladies and gentlemen for the first time  I can say that we are having a glimpse  of the future I am talking about chat  GPT so let's find out more about chat  GPT in this video to explain what Chad  GPT is all about I have some text here  that I got from a website and I'm going  to read this text out to you and this  text will explain what chapter GPT is  and how it can change the world and why  people are getting concerned about chat  GPT chat GPT is a large language model  developed by openai it uses deep  learning techniques to generate  human-like text it can be fine-tuned for  specific tasks such as language  translation question answering and  conversation it can also be used to  generate creative writing poetry and  more the potential applications for chat  GPT are wide ranging and could have a  significant impact on fields such as  customer service content creation and  education it could also have a profound  impact on the way we interact with  technology making it more natural and  intuitive now let's answer the question  why are people getting concerned about  chat GPT some people are concerned about  chat GPT and other large language models  because of their ability to generate  highly convincing and realistic text  this has raised concerns about the  potential for these models to be used  for malicious purpose services such as  creating fake news or impersonating real  people online additionally there are  concerns about ethical implications of  creating AI that can so closely mimic  human language and thought and Now  ladies and gentlemen I want to reveal  the source of this information and the  source is chat GPT itself  can you believe this I asked the chat  bot to describe what chat GPT is and how  it could change the world and why are  people getting concerned about chat GPT  and this is the answer that it gave me  it is incredible I mean  not only did it understand the question  but it spat out an answer that is so  close to human conversation that anybody  could understand and I think it fooled  you did you know that this text was  written by Chad GPT I don't think so  this is what we're talking about and in  this video ladies and gentlemen I want  to give you examples first of all I want  to show you how chat GPT Works let's use  it together and I want to show you  examples of how you can use it and how  incredible this thing is and why chat  GPT could be the future  all right so to access chat GPT all what  you have to do is go to  chat.openai.com and then you have to  register if you're not already  registered with open AI once you  register you you get access to this free  chat button now remember chat GPT is  free for now but that means that in the  near future  it's no longer going to be free and  you're going to have to pay for it so  this is how chatgpt's homepage looks  like and as you can see it gave and as  you can see it gave examples here it  says here for example explain Quantum  Computing in simple terms got any  creative ideas for a 10 year old's  birthday how do I make an HTTP request  in JavaScript so these are examples of  the kind of questions that you can ask  it to do it can give you essays it can  understand what you're saying it can  give you ideas the other day I asked it  to do some copywriting and I'll show you  exactly what I mean it could even do  coding for you it could code it could do  programming it could debug codes it  could write poems for you and now let's  talk a little bit about the capabilities  it remembers what users said earlier in  the conversation so that means it  follows the conversation and understands  what you're telling it it allows the  user to provide follow-up Corrections  and it's trained to decline  inappropriate requests so if there's  anybody out there who's asking it to do  or say anything inappropriate it would  decline that request as for limitations  remember it's not perfect so it  occasionally generates incorrect  information that means you have to check  the information that it gives you it may  occasionally produce harmful  instructions or biased content and  finally it has limited knowledge of the  world and the events after 2021. now  this model has been trained up until  2021 so it doesn't know about events  that happened Beyond 2021 so if you ask  it for example who won the World Cup in  2022 it wouldn't understand it won't  know because it doesn't have access to  that information I want to test chat GPT  so let's start with the first question I  want to say or instruction app as a  matter of fact let's ask it to give us  ideas give me 10 ideas  for writing a blog post about cars  foreign  there you go in action check this out  the history and evolution of the  automobile the future of electric and  autonomous vehicles blah blah blah  look at all of those tips for  maintaining and repairing your car how  to buy a used car and what to look for  it keeps spitting out more and more  information so with just a click of a  button it generated 10 ideas for me for  writing a blog post about cars can you  believe this thing now let's take it up  a notch and ask it to write an article  so I'm going to say write an article  about the history and evolution of the  automobile  look at this thing it's Working Man the  history of the automobile is a  fascinating and intricate one that spans  over a century from the earliest days of  the steam-powered car to the Sleek  electric vehicles of today the  automobile has undergone a tremendous  transformation now as a copywriter  myself I can tell you that the text is  not 100 of course it's not perfect it's  not as good as a human generated text as  a professional for example as a  professional copywriter but it's so  close I mean it's crazy good look at  this it's amazing the first automobile  was invented by Nicholas Joseph blah  blah blah it was a steam  it's spitting out information it's  giving you an entire blog post  it's incredible  still going on by the way you can tell  it to do exactly what you want for  example you can tell it to write a 700  word article  that has one two three four five so you  can tell it exactly what you want you  can put the restrictions the limitations  you could tell that the chat bot to do  exactly what you wanted to do well  finally it finished and the ending says  today the automobile industry is facing  a new set of challenges climate change  blah blah blah incredible  now  with all of this incredible technology  there are a lot of people that are  concerned about this and  the first industry that was hit and I  used the word hit because some people  are so concerned about this our  universities and schools and as a matter  of fact in in the United States a lot of  schools now are Banning the use of chat  gbt they're telling their students that  if anybody uses chat GPT they're going  to be penalized the problem is I  understand where these schools and  colleges are coming from this could be  used as a plagiarism tool I mean if I  were a student if I were a teenager a 15  year old teenager I'm being honest here  I would be tempted to use a tool that  could spit out an essay in a couple of  seconds and do my homework for me I'd  I'd be tempted and I understand the  implications of plagiarism and all of  that however I think that through proper  techniques through proper processes  universities and schools can work with  open AI to be able to detect any sort of  AI generated text such as opengpt or  other AIS out there and I think we  should embrace such technology so so I  see a lot of people out there that are  against chat GPT as a matter of fact  they are threatened by it and  understandably so  but to these people I say I call them  luddites because come on why would you  hate technology yes this technology  might sound a little bit intimidating to  you but that's because it's new Once the  novelty Factor wears off a lot of people  are going to embrace this technology I  don't see this as a threat as a matter  of fact I see this as an incredible  assistive tool that can help us save so  much time if you're a writer a  copywriter a student a researcher this  is it this is what we want I've been  wanting something like this for years  let me tell you a little story about how  I tried so hard to find an AI engine  like this that could help me do my  research do you remember IBM's Watson I  remember signing up on IBM's Watson and  I remember trying their apis and I  remember trying to create something so  similar to chat GPT that was my purpose  and unfortunately it didn't work with  IBM Watson and I was very disappointed  with it and I thought  I don't know maybe it will never happen  the day where this can happen talking to  a chat bot an AI chat bot that  understands what you want follows the  conversation gives you information in a  Split Second  it's just incredible guys you gotta try  this all right so the next use case  scenario let's ask it to write code for  us I'm going to say write code for okay  write code using python script for a  simple program for a simple calendar  program  let's see what that happens by the way  this is the first time I'm asking it to  do this I don't know what's going to  happen so let's see  look at this thing here's a here's an  example of a simple calendar program  written in Python now I'm not a  programmer so programmers out there look  at this I think you're going to be  fascinated look at what look at what  it's doing man  and there you go the program uses the  calendar module to create a calendar for  a specific month and year the user is  prompted to enter the year and month and  the calendar the function is used to  create the calendar so it can create  code for you and it can also debug the  code so if you have a problem not just  debug it can explain exactly where the  mistake is in your code say We'll debug  the code and it will tell you why it's  wrong now I don't have I don't have code  that has a problem in it so if you're a  programmer you can check it out yourself  now let's move on to the next use case  scenario I want to ask it to write a  poem I'm going to say write a poem  about  a guy who has been waiting for  artificial intelligence  no for an artificial intelligence  chat bot for many years and finally  found it  he is very happy  it's the first time I'm asking it to do  something like this  let's see  this he waited for so long a lifetime it  seemed for an AI to come his heart and  mind beamed he dreamed of a day when  technology would rise and a chatbot  would Bloom before his very eyes this is  cool man he searched high and low  through mountains and streams hoping to  find a bot that was supreme but the  years went by and his hopes began to  fade until one day his search was  finally late  he stumbled upon it in the depths of the  web a chatbot like none he had ever met  with its words so wise and its answers  so true he knew right then his search  was through no more waiting no more pain  his heart was filled with joy and  refrain he talked and talked for hours  on end with his new friend a True  Companion  he sagged the stars and the gods above  okay I don't like that part for this  gift of love this chatbot of his he knew  that from now on he'd never be alone for  the AI was there and his heart was home  foreign  Bravo man I cannot believe that an AI  just spat out a poem for me in a second  well in five seconds to be exact  it's so good man  this is just incredible I I don't know I  don't know what to say man  I think a lot of jobs are in Jeopardy in  the future I mean a lot of jobs are  going to go  if you're a copywriter a voiceover  artist a writer even  a graphic designer I think all these  jobs are going to be in trouble because  AI is coming and AI now is getting  creative as well  look at this thing it just spat out a  poem for me in a few seconds AI has  entered the world of creativity now it's  becoming creative  wow  let's ask it to write some marketing  copy for us okay write marketing copy  about  classifieds okay let's let's see if it  understands about a classifieds  platform that uses artificial it's gonna  be so good intelligence oh the irony  right marketing copy about a classifieds  platform that uses artificial  intelligence you know that uses  and artificial intelligence engine  that targets the right  buyers  for cars and real estate  let's see what happens  look at this man introducing the most  advanced classifieds platform for buying  and selling cars and real estate our  platform is powered by cutting-edge  artificial intelligence technology that  ensures you reach the right buyers for  your vehicles and properties with our AI  driven system you can rest

gonna take that copy and use  it  mom's the word in this case chat GPT is  the word  now that I gave you so many examples on  how to use chat GPT let's see if it  follows a conversation and understands  and remembers what you said so I'm going  to start a conversation here and let's  see if it understands hey there chat GPT  how are you  my name is Adam and I am a big fan of  you and artificial intelligence  hello Adam as a matter of fact I'm going  to let the computer read this one so  let it finish and I'll let the computer  read it so it sounds cool like like one  of those movies you know he's talking to  artificial intelligence  all right now that it finished I'm going  to let the computer read it Mac go ahead  and read it for me  hello Adam I'm glad to hear that you're  a fan of artificial intelligence I'm  just a computer program so I do not have  feelings or emotions but I'm always  ready to help you with any information  or task you need is there anything  specific you would like to know or talk  about related to AI or any other topic  I'm here to assist you  awesome okay let's see  what can  you do  foreign  I am a language model called Chachi PT  which means I can't generate human-like  text based on the input I receive I  can't answer questions write stories  articles poetry and even code I can't  provide information translate languages  and assist with research I can also  generate creative content such as song  lyrics screenplays and jokes I can also  assist with specific tasks such as  scheduling data analysis and more let me  know what you need and I will do my best  to assist you  cool so so far I kind of feel like it's  following the conversation but let's  test it even further let's say  you say that you can  tell jokes  can you tell a joke about artificial  intelligence  let's see you'll Now understand where  I'm going with this  sure here's a joke  okay let the computer read it  sure here's a joke about artificial  intelligence why was the robot sad  because its circuits were down you can  also ask me for a different kind of joke  if you prefer  because its circuits were down  play on words man now let me see if it  can understand a follow-up question on  this  can you okay let me see if it  understands this if it understands what  I'm about to ask it that means it's  truly artificially intelligent  can you  explained to me  the last line about  circuits  what is the meaning of it  let's see if it understands  what  nice  wow you will not be able to find  something like this with your Siri by  the way your Siri is dumb your Google  assistant is dumb  look at this okay I'm gonna let the  computer read this  the last line of the joke because its  circuits were down is upon on the phrase  It's upon down or depressed the word  circuits is a reference to the  electrical circuits that power a robot  or machine and the phrase we're down  refers to the idea that these circuits  are not functioning properly the joke is  essentially saying that the robot is  feeling sad or depressed because  something is not working correctly  within it  their life  amazing amazing it it truly understands  the question it follows the conversation  and understands what you want and it  remembers what you said ladies and  gentlemen  I think Chachi PT will pass the touring  test if you don't know what I'm talking  about look up the touring test  now  let's ask it one more thing  for fun  of course  what do you think  will  be the future of artificial intelligence  do you think that this Singularity event  will happen now we are entering the  realm of Science Fiction  and do you think that AI will take over  the world and become sentient  when it becomes sentient  foreign  let's see what it's going to say do you  think Skynet is talking to me right now  who knows  oh my God it mentioned AGI of course I  know what AGI is I did a video about  artificial general intelligence okay  let's read this as a matter of fact I'm  going to read this myself  artificial intelligence is a rapidly  growing field and its potential for for  the future is vast many experts believe  that AI will continue to advance and  play an increasingly important role in  our lives from automating repetitive  tasks to augmenting human intelligence  some experts predict that AI will  eventually be able to perform any  intellectual tasks that a human being  can leading to the concept of artificial  general intelligence The Singularity  event is a hypothetical point in the  future when artificial intelligence will  reach a level of sophistication that can  improve itself at an exponential rate  resulting in an intelligence explosion  and leading to a state where the future  becomes impossible to predict or  understand the idea of the singularity  event is controversial with some experts  arguing that it is unlikely to happen  while others believe that it is  inevitable  as for the fear of AI taking over the  world you see it understands every part  of the question it answers every part of  the question  it is important to note that AI is a  tool created by is a tool created and  controlled by humans it will do only  what it's programmed to do and it is not  self-aware or sentient it does not have  desires or motives of its own however as  AI becomes more advanced it is crucial  that we ensure that it has developed and  deployed ethically with safeguards in  place to prevent any potential negative  impacts it is important for researchers  developers and policy makers to work  together to ensure that AI is developed  and used in a responsible and beneficial  way for Humanity translation Skynet is  not coming  thank you chat GPT you have truly  impressed me I am amazed wow you see  guys this is just a glimpse of the  future and can you believe in just 10 or  20 years time  we're going to be able to talk to our  devices just like this Siri will finally  or Google Assistant will finally become  smart you'll be able to have  conversations with your phone  you're going to be having your own  personal Butler your own personal  assistant  wow  we're going to be having conversations  with our phones they will follow the  conversation they will understand  natural language processing  it's just incredible but  Now what is my take on all of this and  the advancing Technologies of artificial  intelligence I'm a tech guy and I love  the world of technology and I am  completely for artificial intelligence  and I support developing it because I  truly believe that artificial  intelligence will lead us into an  amazing future it can save us a lot of  time it could do the tasks that people  find boring or dangerous for us however  if you watch Dr Sherry turkle's video on  TED Talk the one about connected but  alone  she said that she's afraid that this  future will lead us into being  disconnected from one another and I I  find that to be absolutely true imagine  if in the future everyone's just talking  to their phones everyone's talking to  their own version of artificial  intelligence and at the end of the day  no matter how advanced these machines  are they don't they can't feel they  don't understand what it means to have a  human ex they don't have the Human  Experience  they don't understand  so at the end of the day  that could be a big problem for us  because we won't be communicating with  each other anymore as humans we'd rather  be talking to our machines and God  forbid movies like her happen somebody  falls in love with their computer  somebody [ __ ]  somebody having his phone as a  girlfriend  which is really pathetic so if you  haven't watched Dr Sherry turkle's video  on connected but alone I highly suggest  you watch it it tells you about this it  tells you about the future and the  concerns that she has about the future  however that need not be the case if we  if we do it right  it doesn't have to be that way  thank you guys for watching this video  If you like this video give it a like  and if you really like this video  subscribe to the channel and check out  chatgpt if you haven't because this  thing is free for now they're going to  start charging for this thing soon go  ahead right now to openai.com and check  it for yourself  have a great day
