 [Music]  foreign  [Music]  folks greetings from the offensive  Security Group here at secure it360  coming at you with a new episode of the  Cyber threat perspective today uh you  have myself Spencer and Darius again uh  to talk about a wonderful subject of AI  and chat Bots and all good things uh as  always if you find this information  useful to you or  entertaining educational fun whatever uh  you can support us with subscribing or  following the podcast and sharing it  with your network  so yeah uh we started talking about this  in the last couple days there's been  some new developments with AI  uh so we're going to be talking about AI  particularly a specific type of AI an AI  chat bot called chat GPT  so if you haven't heard uh just recently  chat gbt was announced and released and  it's a prototype AI chat bot that has  been developed by a company called open  AI  and it focuses on usability and dialogue  according to their website the dialog  format makes it possible for chat GPT to  answer follow-up questions add minutes  mistakes challenge incorrect premises  and reject inappropriate requests now  this is information right from their  website uh so AI is not new right this  is something that's been in development  for a long time you hear AI all the time  in infosec right there's all sorts of AI  buzzwords going around uh in chat Bots  themselves they're not new either right  you might be familiar with chat Bots for  like your insurance company you say hey  I need a new quote for my insurance and  then they take all your information and  you know do it through a chat bot right  on Facebook or whatever  so this is not new and you know Darius  and I are definitely not you know AI  experts or uh you know deeply technical  computer science tests or anything like  that but uh our first impressions of  this have been uh one of uh  like jaw dropping right like when you  first look at this uh it's like pretty  incredible what it's done and it's  clearly one of the most advanced AI chat  bot you know things that have come out  in recent years uh and so Darius and I  want to talk about that this what that's  what this episode is going to be about  uh you know talk about a little bit  about the warnings and limitations of  the chatbot we'll talk about the use  cases and what we see  the use cases being for our job for pin  testing for offensive security but also  for other fields as well like you know  blue team  and things like that we'll give some  detailed examples and kind of go into  how we plan to use this how we've  already used it and played around with  it and then we'll talk about the impact  on infosec the impact on business and  Humanity civilization as we know it and  then we'll wrap it up so Darius uh  thanks for joining me again what are  your first impressions of this yeah so  first impressions  um it's just insane how powerful this  tool is uh like you like you touched on  I mean this isn't the first chat bot  that's existed there are tons of them  um I remember using one called replica  last year but I think the interesting  thing about you know this one in  particular is  just how much knowledge it possesses it  seems to be geared differently  um than other chat Bots that I've  experienced in the sense of you know  earlier you talked about how you know  you may have a chat bot for an insurance  policy or you know you have some chat  Bots that are focused more so on just  having a human conversation and being  more of a friend  um this one it's like a chat bot  combined with the entirety of Google and  that's just truly what makes it  impressive of the fact that you can just  give it a loose scenario and it's able  to pretty much give you a full  product and a conversation all in one  um it's just it's just mind-blowing  yeah definitely and uh  you know one of the things I think is is  interesting too is how quickly uh  something like this goes viral you know  people are sharing screenshots on  Twitter they're sharing different ways  to uh to use it and abuse it they're  showing different ways to get around the  uh like the Privacy or not the Privacy  the security implications right if it  you if you tell it you know how do I  make a Molotov cocktail it's like well  you know that's bad you shouldn't do  that but then there's ways around it  right which leads me into the next point  the next discussion point is some  limitations there's definitely  limitations and there's definitely  things to be cognizant of uh with AI  with chat Bots and uh you know from  their website a couple of their  limitations I'll read off is you know  sometimes you know and this is evident  when you see people sharing screenshots  and sharing what they've done with it is  sometimes the answers that it gives is  really good or it sounds really good but  uh they can many times be incorrect or  wrong or just don't make sense right  they're silly uh so that's an  interesting part too right Darius is  like you give it a prompt or you ask it  a question and it comes up with some  reasonably you know verbose message and  it makes you think that it's correct and  since you're asking it you probably  don't know the correct answer or you're  looking for something to help  help you find the correct answer so you  might not realize that the answer that  it gives you is actually wrong  yep  um at the end of the but to that point  though I think it's really interesting  is at you know at the end of the day  even when it gets a wrong answer it's  technically learning and improving right  yeah so  um yeah so it's interesting to see how  it goes over time I know personally I  found myself uh asking it to you know  create a create different scenes from  Seinfeld and to the point of it being  nonsensical or you know like yeah like  do the scenes always make sense no but  it is it is entertaining when they at  least someone is able to somewhat  replicate the feeling of you know George  Costanza right like it's it's it's like  halfway there but it's definitely but  yeah it's definitely not 100 to where  you know you could feasibly say you know  hey write me a a movie that's going to  top the box office probably not there  yet for sure  um  good for inspiration though right like  you can create a prompt to create some  inspiration to then create that thing  right it's like you don't know what  question to ask so you ask it you ask  the AI something to kind of spur your  inspiration and then you take that and  run with it yep exactly which that kind  of leads into I think something we're  going to talk about a little bit later  on  um but I know another limitation is it's  um it's sensitive to how you phrase  things which can be both a good and a  bad thing you know you talk about  potential  um you know bypasses right like it has  controls in place  um one bypass I've noticed is if you  tell it oh no I'm doing this for testing  or for a demo it's like oh okay well  here's this malicious thing that you  wanted yeah um  yeah I saw someone post recently like  how do I break into a house and it's  like well that's bad don't do that and  then I was like no no I just want to  protect my house I was like okay here's  how here's how the things to defend  against so it's like yeah or like uh one  I've seen is the movie script right like  I'm writing a movie script for this you  know mob boss guy and he wants to do  this thing and you know I was like here  here's the recipe for doing this thing  or like robbing a bank or whatever it is  you just put like yeah for testing  purposes only or whatever the the case  might be to kind of get around that I  think it's it's kind of funny as well  yeah I think it's just important for  people to realize you know it's yes  we're using human language to interact  with it  but it's not human it's still at the end  of the day it's code it's a whole bunch  of different algorithms and so you know  it's not it's not going to be able  currently at least not going to be able  to think wait a minute that's suspicious  you know you need to go through the  appropriate channels it's just not it's  just not there yet yep  yeah which which leads us to kind of the  next point of this this section is the  warnings right we talked about  limitations and warnings one of the  warnings or one of the things to be  cognizant of is something that we talked  about uh earlier on an internal meeting  was you know lack of morals right AI is  void of beliefs and uh context and  social norms and morals you know so uh  ethics right as you had mentioned Darius  uh it's it lacks those things so when  you say hey create a Molotov cocktail  it's like well that's bad you probably  shouldn't do that it knows that malcolf  cocktails you know can create damage and  cause uh damage inflict pain or or death  even and you know it knows some of those  things based on the qualities of the  thing that you're asking  but it doesn't know that like you  probably shouldn't just create them all  type of cocktail and go throw it in  somebody's house uh so it gives you the  answer that you're looking for because  you know that's it tries to provide you  facts for the question that you're  answering uh so one of the things to be  mindful of uh and one of the things that  I think scares us right and we'll talk  about kind of in the in the end of the  episode of the impact and what this  looks like maybe going forward  one of the things that kind of scary  kind of scares us maybe you know as  human beings is that uh Ai and these  chatbots lack morals  yeah I I and it's like how do you see  that that's such a philosophical thing  because then it's like yeah I know right  like how how do you develop that it's  just oh man we could Rabbit Trail  if anybody if anybody's taking  philosophy in college or anything and  wants to have a philosophical discussion  for the podcast maybe that's an episode  we do yeah you know at what point do we  consider AI a living being I mean who  who knows  but keeping us on on on topic though uh  potential and possible uses  um yeah like what are you thinking  Spencer  yeah so being a pen tester  um my natural inclination was you know  how do I do things to uh help with my  job or just help me do things that I  would do on a normal basis but speed it  up help me be more efficient more  accurate things like that a couple of  the ideas that I had that I wanted to  share were  obviously skating code right if I tell  uh the chatbot to you know I paste a  snippet of code in there and I say hey  Chapa replace all the function names the  variable names the strings with random  characters or obfuscate it in some way  or use space64 for encoding these  strings or whatever in order to  obfuscate it I can you know quickly  prototype what an obfuscated piece of  code would look like  another one I think is really  interesting too is creating Word lists  really quickly just based on some  information so you give it uh a company  name their demographics like where the  company is located maybe where their  offices are the time of the year sports  teams you know you give it a whole bunch  of data and say hey spit out a word list  that I can use to you know test  passwords uh and it'll spit it out you  know instantly right so those are some  of the things I think are interesting uh  the other thing I think is interesting  too is and I know we have a long list so  we probably won't be able to go through  every single scenario but the other one  that I thought was interesting is regex  right we use I use regex all the time  when I'm searching through files or you  know snooping file shares looking for uh  credentials right I get a I get a dump  of a whole bunch of files  and I want to search them uh maybe I  want to some complex  regex expression to search for certain  things or certain extensions now I don't  have to struggle with regex 101 I can  just go to chat gbtv like how do I do  this again you know and it'll it knows  things like reverse lookups and Knots  and you know all those things that you  maybe you can remember but are not super  good at it uh so those are some of the  things I think are kind of neat for for  my day today  um but what about you Darris  uh so initially  um met payloads just like hey give me a  list of payloads I think that's really  cool even even from like an  understanding of a from a code  perspective so I put my putting myself  in the shoes of let's say I'm a new  um developer or a new web app pin tester  and I come across a framework I'm not  familiar with being able to just ask hey  can you tell me about this framework and  potential vulnerabilities that right  there is is huge and even getting to the  point of like hey you know spit me out a  vulnerable function so that I can play  with it to then really understand it to  then go actually attack a web app that  uses that framework I mean that right  there is and it's different from Google  right like you search that on Google and  you get results that are ranked based on  SEO and you get ads at the top and like  you could find that information by  searching Google but this gives you it's  like you're talking to a developer right  because they're giving you the answer  specifically what you're looking for not  the one that ranks best in Google or has  the best SEO or best whatever  and the biggest thing is just the fact  that it will actually write the function  for you like that right there it's just  it's it's it's huge  um especially if you're just starting  out  um and you know from I guess a blue team  and or like Defender standpoint there's  some pretty cool things pretty cool ways  you could um implement this within your  workflow  um let's say you know you have a list  you have this just a whole bunch of  security logs hey write me a script to  help parse this for for you know Parts  get all the IPS out of this all these  out of these windows logs  um you know hey help me create a Yara  rule  um based around certain activity  um and what I personally think it's cool  is you know utilizing AI  to make AI to where you can say like hey  help me write an algorithm to  um  to give a reputation of you know  bad good to a list of ips based on a  criteria of like location or whatever  and then you can even say take it a step  further and say oh and also give me a  pipe you know go ahead and create a  python model for me  um and then boom you can now  it's essentially utilize AI somewhat in  your workflow for analyzing IPS uh  so tons of potential the potential is is  kind of Limitless it's just it's just a  matter of you know what you imagine and  um  asking the right questions so that you  get what you're looking for yep yeah you  know putting my GRC hat on for a minute  my ISO hat uh I think about policies and  procedures too for for Defenders and  blue teams one of the hardest things I  think that uh from a GRC standpoint is  just coming up with language right  creating language to add to a policy for  something that you're doing right it's  just not something that uh you know a  security practitioner is necessarily  good at just you know out of the gate  right coming up with language for  policies and procedures  uh you know is a really interesting use  case as well  and it's kind of along the lines of  phishing right you know we use  uh chat GPT we can use chat gbt for  phishing and pre-texts right to come up  with some fancy language for phishing  emails and SMS and things like that we  can do the same thing for policies and  procedures for The Blue Team for the  Defenders you know write me a policy or  an executive summary  for a report or a policy for this or a  policy for that so I think that's  interesting as well as being able to use  it for reporting and Analysis  um you know creating Cliff Notes from  meetings and in all sorts of interesting  things that you would never think of but  it's like you take this you know the  meeting notes or you take this report  it's like hey summarize this report to  me for me in like an executive summary  Etc et cetera that is a game changer  yeah right exactly right yeah right like  you you have some pen test report right  you have the executive summary or maybe  it's like a detailed report it's like  summarize this report for me you know in  five bullets and show me you know  whatever uh you know whatever  and  that's  terrifying it's extremely cool but yeah  it's it's terrifying  um in the same vein uh so I guess let's  talk about I guess impact uh we could  talk a little bit about the impact on  you know now that now that I mean it's  always existed but now that it's getting  better and it's still crazy to me that  this is just a prototype for it to be a  prototype man like  insane yeah um  but for me as far as impact goes it's um  it's it can kind of be split up into  different categories right you have you  have your your known knowns and then you  also have you know what you don't know  um  and maybe we can talk a little bit just  about like what we kind of foresee on  the horizon  um one of the first things I kind of see  is that it's going to be interesting  moving forward where you know less  knowledge may be required for certain  positions And what I mean by that is  um  maybe for a junior position now you know  maybe less coding knowledge is required  because you can utilize AI to kind of  assist with that that being said you  know  uh double-edged swords you don't want it  to be a crutch  um you know what what happens when it's  like yeah I've been a developer for five  years now granted most you know the bulk  of the time my code has just been  written by you know Ai and I've just  been kind of you know I know how to plug  and play and modify it to an extent but  you know it's like what happens with  that knowledge because you still  ultimately need that deeper level  knowledge and even a foundational  knowledge so really be good at what you  do but you know does that even matter in  the future where you have ai to kind of  handle it for you right so  um yeah I think we can imagine  yeah I think we can imagine a world  where there's both where there's you  know there's the group that that doesn't  have the development experience and they  use Ai and they Implement things and  then I think there's another group like  you said that is deeply Technical and  understands how to prompt and how to  write uh code and develop things I think  it's interesting what you're bringing up  it's gonna be it's I imagine in the  future I'm only 27 now  um but I imagine as I get older I might  be the the mid senior person one day  that's going like man these new guys  they they don't know how to write code  anymore they're just relying on AI yeah  and like back in my day we did it we did  we wrote Our functions manually and we  liked it like it's just it's interesting  to see what's gonna happen I can't wait  for Generations yeah I can't wait to see  on LinkedIn like senior AI developer and  it's like that person isn't the person  creating the AI they're a developer  from writing prompts to create the code  I mean that's kind of the future that it  looks like we're heading towards  um you know and lastly I'll say just  from a coding perspective is uh meant  enter the interview process is going to  have to change you know I look at some  of the uh like a lot of the Fang  companies and they're like hey in order  to even get your to even talk to  somebody you need to complete a  challenge okay that's fine give me any  leap code challenge you want I'm just  gonna take the prompt and you know give  it to open GPT and then yeah here's  I answered your question you know hire  me so that's going to be interesting to  see how the interview process changes  um as a result as AI gets better  um I think something else that will that  we'll see on the horizon is uh how we  approach problems will change  um so you touched on it earlier you know  one of the first things we do when we we  run into a problem is I'm going to do a  Google Search and I'm going to dig  through as many sources as I can until I  can figure out my answer  um but that changes now it's no longer a  Google search It's how do you query the  AI to right answer your question or to  do what you needed to do  um and which may eventually be a skill  that's needed you know we talk about  Google Foo and Google Dorking maybe the  next one is aiifu  you know yeah what do you call it by the  way like what do you call being able to  uh write AI prompts is that are you a  prompter or like we need to we need to  go on the record and Define some name  like Google Dorking is a thing it was  coined by somebody I forget who I  apology apologize but we need the  equivalent of Google Dorking for writing  API prompts or writing AI prompts so  what is it Darius oh well we I know a  perfect place to ask that question and  figure it out  we need like a like a cool slang term  for somebody uh who writes uh AI prompts  or like when you're writing AI prompts  I wonder if it's just I guess I guess  it's not machine learning engineered I  mean maybe that's what it is currently I  don't know well you know like Google  Dorking is just like yeah it's Google  searches  AI prompt like prompting  is that prompting or AI prompting or uh  I don't know AI prompting sounds kind of  boring but I mean it's hey you heard it  here first it's it's officially called  AI prompting from here yeah I prompting  uh I don't know if you're listening and  you have ideas put them in the comments  or like tweet at us or  post on LinkedIn or something if you  have any ideas for that I'm terrible at  like name ideas but you know we should  just ask chat gbt what they would what  it would call itself  for sure but yeah uh getting back to the  topic at hand of of impact uh you  mentioned uh you know  no longer do you you're gonna search for  Google you go to chat and uh you ask it  based on prompts so knowing how to write  those prompts is going to be really  important going forward and I think we  can see that in a number of different  areas asking the right question and we  talked about this before there was a  video that I shared by ipsac who had a  Sim he had a video for hack the Box  University CTF that's going on and he  said in his video that like you know  asking the right questions and thinking  outside the box is a really important  skill as a hacker as a pen tester or as  anybody it's a life skill right so  knowing the question to ask is going to  be more important than just knowing what  to search for or whatever so I think  that's going to be an important skill  going forward for sure  agreed uh I think something else that we  know as far as impact is it's going to  kind of change the infosec to landscape  a little bit in terms of now there are  new security concerns  um so you know you touched on it earlier  but the first one is you know this is  the Nigerian Prince's what you know  dream right if I'm struggling with a  certain language if I'm across the world  I can now I now have something that's  going to essentially write my email for  me it's going to be somewhat  grammatically correct you can even ask  it to you know become a little bit more  personal and use you know certain  Regional dialects  um and you know that's just really it's  going to make it's going to become a lot  more challenging for end users to be  able to discern wait a second is this  is this fishing or is this an actual  email yeah write this email as a pirate  right like it's it it can do that and  it's it's it's cool but you know it's  definitely going to change things a  little bit  um something else that I think will be  interesting is you know that using it to  aggregate public information to create  you know create created list  um about your firm that can then be used  you know maliciously  um to kind of further you know other  types of attacks so that's going to be  you know fairly interesting once you  know what happens once there are models  out there that can go and detect like  you know hey based upon all this  information that I pulled down about the  company and you know the CEO and user  and the users that I was able to find  you know  try this yeah or you know it's just it's  going to be it's crazy where where we're  heading to yeah  and and by the way I so I just asked  chat GPT what you know this funny slang  term for AI prompting would be and they  said AI Nader like Terminator like AI  Terminator  but then I thought of you know Ai and 80  uh anator like you know how uh  Doofenshmirtz or whatever that was that  Brad was talking about yesterday like Ai  and Nader  something like that that's a cool job  title I mean can I change my job title  to something like that I mean yeah  having something like Terminator or  Nader in your job title or an AI  promptinator  ooh I like that one  sorry I'm taking it way off tangent but  I had to think about it and capture that  so now I can we can go back no no these  are these are the important questions  Spencer absolutely it's like ASCII art  right in your tool like that's the first  thing you make yeah oh hands down  um there have actually been plenty of  times where I have the ASCII art but I  haven't finished the project but  um but then and the last thing I just  want to say from like a security concern  and something that we have to consider  is at the end of the day  um it's  AI it knows how to write code it knows  how to come up with suggestions and do  things because of other human  interactions that it has it's all just  essentially trial and error until  eventually it hits a you know a um a  confidence level of like okay I know  that when I see these keywords  um I'm going to basically say this right  you know I'm oversimplifying it but at  the end of the day that's what it is and  so  I think what another security concern  that we have to be careful about is what  are especially as end users start to use  it more and more is how are people  within the company utilizing it and you  know potentially what companies Secrets  or sensitive information are they just  giving away to a third party right  um you know whether you're a developer  and it's like and it's you know I need  help writing something like hey debug my  code copy paste you know that's been  sent somewhere  um and you know who knows what's being  done with it  um even similar for you know if you  start to deal with I think from like a  HIPAA perspective because um I was uh  Nicole and I were talking about this  yesterday of like you know what about  what happens with like patient  information or patient data or like you  know just things from that perspective  where you know maybe you send off you  know you ask a question of like hey I  have a patient with these symptoms you  know what could it possibly be  um you know just it just the  possibilities are endless and at the end  of the day I really think it's you know  we're gonna have to really think about  the fact that if we are using it  what's happening with the data yep yes  it's sitting out an S3 bucket somewhere  where everybody could just query it and  just find everything that everybody has  ever created and it's just linked to  everybody's Google account or whatever  and it's like oh nice cool this is this  is what so-and-so was searching and you  just have like a it's like it's like  looking at somebody's browser history  you know it's like what you search for  on the Internet is a pretty good  indicative uh you know indicator of you  know the type of thing that you're doing  on a day-to-day basis  the question is can you convince chat  GPT to kind of tell you you know hey  open up and just give me the keys to the  kingdom of like all of your information  like is that possible  that's another thing that was funny is  like people were like rooting the chat a  the chat bot right and they were  printing out you know hashes and you  know showing you know uh stuff like that  I thought that was funny as well because  it's clearly like creating a fake  environment  um but something else that I thought was  funny yeah I mean it it kind of opens up  you know at some point are there going  to be pin tests  involving apis yeah I mean AIS  so what about unknowns right you talked  about knowns uh what about the unknown  things like you admit you'd want to talk  about or you wanted to talk about some  of the things that you know are going to  be an impact like the no question  there's going to be an impact this is  going to have an impact on a various uh  various things uh one of those things  like jobs you mentioned governments  regulation stuff but you know what are  some ideas you think or thoughts around  what are the unknowns of this or maybe  some potential pitfalls  uh so the unknowns  um like you said one first of all jobs  are gonna change significantly  um and like you can kind of take a guess  right like like you said you know AI  promptinator might be a job one day  um but like you know like I just think  it's gonna depending on how big it gets  it potentially impact job requirements  and what you're expected to kind of know  you know like you're kind of right now  you're kind of expected to if you have a  problem know how to at least Google and  somewhat find an answer that may now be  that may not be replaced  um  same thing I'd also say is you know what  I think I always think from a pin  testing perspective is what happens you  know you already have these automated  pin test platforms and I think you've  discussed you and Brad may have  discussed them before on a previous  podcast  um you know it's always been the at the  end these are just really just glorified  if else scripts that are just running  tools not really analyzing it right well  does that change now you know as AI gets  better and better and better  um you know what happens what happens  there so I think that's unknown that's  going to be really interesting to see  um I think something else is you know  currently there and there may be if  there are I don't know about it let us  know but are there regulations around  how AI is implemented and used  um  if if not that to me is kind of scary  because you know um you know what  happens with especially from like a  government use perspective  um that can really blow up and turn into  something I think I think of the movie  you know Minority Report right like it's  like what happens then you know  um and then the last thing that I kind  of think of as far as the unknown is  what happens if slash once we become too  reliant on it right  that right there is just it's going to  be really interesting to see what  happens you know I kind of look back at  like my grandparents or they're like you  need to get off the internet you know  read a book instead you know and I'm I'm  fairly reliant on the internet if I lose  internet access  like 75 of just my day-to-day what can I  do knowledge goes out the window like  how do I even how do I even get  somewhere I don't know what's the map  um but so it's like it's it's really  it's gonna be crazy to see what happens  as we as we continue to use it and it  gets integrated  how much we rely on it yeah we're more  Reliant we become more reliant on our  critical thinking right our ability to  think outside the box or I heard this uh  saying the other day  uh thinking without the box I don't know  who said that but I heard that somewhere  I forget where but thinking outside the  box or thinking without the Box critical  thinking is going to be extremely  important I mean it already is but to to  the extent where you're asking  a AI machine learning model uh whatever  a case may be the answer to or the  solution to a problem being able to ask  those questions in a uh creative way  that leads you to that solution is going  to be an important skill and then you  know I think that's obvious right I  think it's obvious that that's going to  be a very important skill but like you  said to what extent do we come relying  on it and what extent do businesses  bosses jobs  require you to maintain some level of  Base knowledge to interpret those  results right I think that's a an  important question that we as this  continues to develop need to continue to  ask ourselves and be mindful of and you  know something we talk about all the  time  something Brad says all the time is know  your tools right it's not enough to just  know okay nmap Dash sv-sc and you know  it's not enough to just know the flags  right you got to know what those flags  mean you got to know what your tool does  how it looks over the wire maybe  depending on what you're doing you get  to know that that base level knowledge  um  to to really be proficient at it and to  know when it's wrong so I think  interesting nonetheless like all the  unknowns that you mentioned I think are  interesting especially regulation like  with I think of crypto right crypto came  on the scene and Bitcoin and Dodge Coin  and all these things and it was heavily  unregulated at first and now it's  becoming more and more regulated uh I  think it's going to be the same kind of  thing right I think there'll be a point  where things happen it gets to a point  of maturity where there has to be  regulations because of  uh the outcomes of it  so  uh interesting nonetheless though we're  definitely not fortune tellers so we'll  have to see I think that's the exciting  part right Darius is just  seeing this develop and seeing where  this goes for sure uh and last thing  I'll say is just you know  I hope as the United implement this is  that we don't lose the humanity part of  everything  um  you know I just look at just so many  examples it's just like you know I look  at what happens once we what we  Implement AI to determine you know who  gets raises based off employee  performance you know it's it's and oh  well I didn't decide you know the  algorithm the AI just that's the reason  why you got the raise you got it's my  hands are washed you know it's just  it's  it's the it's I think at the end of the  day and I think Brad kind of talks about  this all the time is you know you have  that human element  um that can't be replicated  um and so we have to be really strategic  with how we use it moving forward yeah  yeah same I I could the same thing and  you know I  said this earlier on our internal call  but I really hope Ai and and this  chatbot thing becomes ubiquitous and  becomes uh a thing that really has the  capabilities uh to advance technology to  advance human civilization Healthcare  forward uh to to help us solve like  really important problems right like  writing a python script cool but like  solving really important problems is  really really cool too and I think  that's a good honorable thing for this  technology to move towards is to help  you know find solutions to terminal  diseases or Cancers and things like that  to help use computing power and data and  Science and Technology to help move  those efforts forward and do things that  humans are not just humanly not possible  for them to do to compute use those  things I hope I hope there's more good  than bad because you know you're only  limited by your imagination at this  point  you know there's obviously limitations  but conceptually you're limited by your  imaginative imagination alone it's like  possibilities are endless and I'm really  excited for it uh I hope the good  outweighs the bad  um but it's gonna be cool to play around  with it while we've got it and uh really  excited to look forward I'm really  excited and look forward to what the  future brings with us  sure  so that's it for us uh if you enjoyed  this episode  definitely make sure that you follow And  subscribe so you're notified when we  post more episodes like this uh more  topics like this we'll be talking about  Ai and chat gbt a lot going forward I'm  sure uh this is you know really  newsworthy right now and it's super cool  and fun to play with so definitely  expect more from us that's all from now  see ya in the next one  [Music]
