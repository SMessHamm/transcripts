 a company called open AI which was not  only co-founded by Elon Musk but was  invested by uh Microsoft I believe put  in a billion dollars into the company  released effectively a Next Generation  AI chat bot  which kind of speaks to you can can  understand normal language and can speak  to you in normal language right we'll  spit back out a regular sort of dialogue  with you yeah it was released at the end  of November and within a few days  reached a million users and the internet  blew up with people posting what they've  been talking to chat GPT about they've  been writing scripts they've been  writing legal briefs they've been doing  all sorts of very interesting stuff and  now people are wondering is this going  to come for me at the law firm is Chad  gbt going to replace me I'm going to  replace my associates  some people are saying uh not so fast  not so sure it's just not as uh  brilliant as you think it is but there  are questions right absolutely  um it yeah like in its present state is  it going to replace the job of a lawyer  no but you're seeing a window into the  future you're seeing what could be and I  think you're starting to already see  some of this with like Doc generation  companies there are plenty of companies  that are coming out that are uh that are  using AI to create these contracts for  you maybe through prompted questions or  um there's some some other means like  that so you're already seeing in  practice but this is like  oh my gosh this is really coming for me  now if I was an attorney yes I would be  a little worried right you're like oh my  gosh like maybe I'm a transactional  attorney and I I make my money drafting  these agreements but also I'm I'm  negotiating these agreements right right  I'm where I understand the risk  tolerances of my client and I know when  to give on some things and what not so  there's always a human element when it  comes to negotiating some of these  agreements but it's definitely  interesting it's definitely kind of like  what you're saying is uh you know you're  kind of touching on the creative aspect  here which is I'm not a lawyer I'm a  writer right and I know that like yes  there are some things that I write that  are very kind of templative very kind of  cut and paste and and there are in the  legal world as well but like you're  saying in negotiations and more creative  thinking capacities uh chat Bots are  nowhere near uh you know human beings  and also open AI openly says this on  their website they they will say this  kind of to your face that the chatbot  still makes plenty of mistakes yeah  still tells you plenty of false  information and if you're a lawyer and  you regurgitate that that's malpractice  can you imagine that can you imagine if  somebody is like I'm just gonna rely on  on them and it creates like you know a  legal brief for uh or emotion of some  kind files with the court of the cards  like what is this this is not real but  there must be certain things within the  legal community that are again very just  boilerplate that you can just 100 play  when you're a litigator and you're doing  a motion to compel production of  documents it's a very basic Discovery  motion right you're most of the time  copying pasting A4 right or there's  always these templates or even certain  agreements right like I know in certain  spaces like an asset purchase agreement  or a per you know a purchase and sale  agreement it's very very very  boilerplate very similar across the  board which again might save you some  time might save your paralegals some  time Etc but it's not replacing you know  the next generation of law school grads  right no so oh that's that's a fair  point if you're in law school rest  assured you've still got at least a  couple years  you're almost there but you got a couple  you're almost right which is so you know  when you really kind of like poke under  the hood of what chat gbt is it's a  predictive text yes so it's going  through all the data of what's been fed  to it and is predicting based on that  what's been said before and and kind of  what it believes should be said next  so like we just been mentioning that's  not really creative that's you know kind  of applies to plug and play but that's  about it exactly exactly right but again  it'll be very interesting to see in the  future I personally as a litigator would  love it right well as a former litigator  I'm sorry I would love to use this  something like this if it can make my  life easier with Discovery requests or  you're right template form Contra  contracts I'm sorry emotions  life thousand times a year so I woke it  I embrace it so it'll be interesting to  see over the next couple years what this  terms into  hey I hope you enjoyed this episode if  you did like And subscribe wherever you  get your podcast check us out also on  LinkedIn and Twitter to keep up to speed  with what we're doing catch you on the  next one  [Music]
