 hey everyone thanks for checking out  another video so chat GPT I have to do  another video it just keeps shocking me  with all these results and I wanted to  do another coding video because code's  kind of my thing and I just thought I  I've been trying some things with it and  it's been amazing me kind of and I've  been seeing other people do things and I  want to just kind of show a real demo  where it's like what is it like to just  kind of back and forth with this thing  and I'm going to put it through its  Paces I'm not going to give it any  breaks so let's just jump in  um so here's chat GPT here  chat.openai.com forward slash chat as  you know it's a it'll tell you it loves  to tell you that it's a language model  so let's just jump right in here  and what I wanted to start with with  coding so I did a video where  uh I had it make code where I had it  make things in 3js and I tried to make a  clock and a happy face and it went okay  it didn't go great I had another video  where I kind of just talked to it and I  didn't have do it any code at all and  with this video what I want to do is try  to give it some code give it some ideas  talk to it and see what it's like as  almost like a little bit of a rubber  duck or talking to some other programmer  just to get a little bit of a back and  forth and some thoughts uh because it's  been pretty interesting too so let's  let's kind of as a base what I'm going  to do is use my my side project datalos  it's somewhat popular it's uh I've  posted tons of videos about it and I  thought you know let's just find some  code and let's just give it a shot  so I thought let's do some code that has  a test uh and that kind of narrows it  down a lot in my code base because I  don't have a lot of tests one of them  that I happen to have is this function  here in just in generic functions file  there's actually a lot of random  functions in here but I thought let's  just grab one and see  and I don't think it's going to do  perfect but I want to show you this back  and forth so here's the code right here  basically all it does is you just give  it a a size and it'll give you like a  Windows 10 version of the formatted size  it's kind of not perfectly sensible uh  the size so I've kind of coded it here  with very few comments and let's just uh  give it a shot so let's say to it here  and I had a case I actually wanted to  add because I was looking and Windows 10  supports higher than let's let's say up  to in this code here I only ever show  gigabyte as the the maximum formatting I  also want to do terabyte and petabyte so  let's do that so I'm going to paste the  code in first then I'm going to go back  to the top here so you can just dump  code in and I'm going to put some  conversation in front of it here and the  conversation that I had prepared here  was add code to handle terabyte and  petabyte sizes so I'm being kind of  rough with it because I'm not saying  like TB and PB I'm saying terabytes and  petabytes I'm talking in a different  language than what's in the code so it's  got to make some connections right there  so let's just do it and see what happens  and nice it's going to do a quick one on  me so right away it's already got a  result you can handle terabyte and  petabyte sizes by adding additional if  statements in the get format size  function okay well obviously that's what  I wanted you to do I see here there's a  petabyte one so it actually has added it  even understood the 999 multiplication  but presumably I wonder if it did that's  actually interesting so this math here  was was absolutely I think was correct  at least it was when I wrote it and it  still is 176 but did this actually do  the math the way that I expected it to  224 no  so I bet what it did here is I bet it  did 10 24s all the way so it's already  introduced a bug interestingly enough  let's see if uh actually I have no idea  where that number came from that's an  interesting number so let's call it on  that but let's see if I did the rest of  the code okay  the rest it actually did so this is  exactly what I wanted I wanted this  extra condition added and unless  something sneaky snuck in uh I think it  basically did that so let's just call it  out on the fact that this number is not  that multiplication so  uh looks good but is not but whatever  the hell that number is I'm not going to  speak it out loud because it's too big  is not this  let's let's call it on that you're  correct the value for bytes and petabyte  is not correct it should be calculated  as that to fix this you can update the  value  okay  uh okay so it stopped pre-caching the  value that's one way to do it I guess  that's interesting so the reason that I  had written those down and commented it  was just so that it didn't have to do  the math every time uh not that it is I  mean depending where you put it it only  does the math once anyways anyways but I  figured hey I'll just do the math ahead  of time so it's decided not to but I  like the solution and that it's just  like hey there you go I fixed it but  let's say that I wanted to Cache that  value  I wanted to Cache that is it an equation  I guess so  addition uh math oh let's call it an  equation it was an equation I wanted to  Cache that equation to Cache the  equation for calculating it so it knows  I'm talking about the petabyte value  and it's taught it knows about changing  it I think although it's oh man it's  even gotten worse here what was it  saying for cash you can define a  variable bytes in kilobyte and use it  okay so it's cached the 1024 but not all  the multiplication math  uh okay interesting it's fun that it's  doing this  in this way but see here's the fight we  have with it so it gave us a little bit  of what we wanted but not completely  because that number wasn't quite right I  could have just done the math and fixed  that number maybe that was the right  number I'm not sure I don't think it was  uh let's try to clarify this more  I wanted all the multiplication  equations to be cash to be  pre-calculated  calculated  but you see how we're having a  conversation with it I'm not really  mincing words or thinking too hard about  how I have to phrase something at the  same time I'm not getting exactly what I  want uh including right here or no  perhaps let's say let's see if it did it  no it still didn't do the math okay so  it did it really understand  pre-calculated values  perhaps it did perhaps it didn't I guess  it depends what it imagines the scope is  here  but as you can see it can get a little  bit tough to kind of get what you want I  mean if I was talking to somebody right  now I would I would hope I would be able  to clarify this but let's actually try  by taking the code this time and saying  I don't want  this math done in code  pre-calculate the numbers  as the constants  con stance and I'll just paste this in  so we stop getting a million other code  hopefully it's like hey just fix this  one piece that I care about  to pre-calculate these values so math is  not a strong suit I guess because it  still seems to be suggesting doing math  for me uh or putting math in the code  because it doesn't seem to be able to do  it  so so I'd say that one's a swing and a  miss let's try the next little piece of  this so let's switch topics on it  it's done what it can with this let's  tell it we want to focus on the get  format size function  uh I want to refactor the git format  size function to not use conditions this  was another one I thought was  interesting because I was just I was  almost just wondering like I don't know  if it's necessary it makes sense but  it's just like how could you refactor it  like I have a few ways I imagine you  could refactor it but let's let it try  to refactor it and see what it can do so  I wanted to refactor that function you  can refactor the function to use a  switch okay so I would almost consider  that a type of conditional I also don't  like that it keeps giving me all the  code all the time it's a very verbose  language model that's one thing I've  noticed but otherwise it did re it did  refactor it with a switch and the switch  isn't bad  now let's say we don't want conditions  and we don't want switches  let's try that  I want it without  conditions  or switches now I think it's probably  going to give me some kind of mapping or  something like that but it's still  thinking out of the box which is fun  and it understands what I'm asking  instead of using IF statements or switch  statements you can use an object with  size ranges okay  so that's pretty neat I would say  probably doesn't work at all  honestly and if we were to try to run  tests on this we would probably run into  some issues but that's something we  could actually do just for fun you know  if we wanted to so let's we've mangled  this thing quite a bit I don't think  that this completely makes sense because  we've lost the greater than actually  let's just tell it that first we've uh  we've lost the greater or is it greater  than or less than it was less than we've  lost the less  than from Harrison's  or is it checks let's call it checks  we've lost them we've lost the less than  checks you are correct the size ranges  object can Define the maximum size for  each range but not the minimum size to  fix this you can add the minimum size  for each range to the object okay so  thinking out of the box  it's decided to  turn it into some kind of size ranges  object oh wow that's kind of an  interesting one so it's really thinking  out of the box I don't know if this is  necessarily the way I would have done it  what would the infinity here and  everything but let's try the next  interesting piece that I wanted to do  because I do have a test for this code  so let's just run let's just run this  code it's gonna fail probably on every  test  but what we can do is we can at least  laugh at it together a little bit and we  can learn to love again with it  so let's paste the code as it is now my  eslint might be a bit mad with it but  for the most part it's accepting the  code is functional operator cannot be  pledged type note number and string  what does it think is the number and a  string let's just ignore that that's  just my eslin being a bit tricky and  let's try this test now so it's probably  going to fail in every case but what I  want to do is I want the results so that  I can tell it so as we see here it  failed on a lot of the cases and  interestingly enough we got a result  here that we got like some checks and we  got some x's so it actually did okay  with the zero on the one test it's great  let's go back to it now and tell it that  so  I ran it through some tests the ones  with x's in front failed  there we go so we got two with the check  and the rest are with x's let's see if  it can understand that the problem is  that the format number function is not  it jumped right to the problem I wonder  if it just new it's like yeah I know  that was buggy you came back to me you  got me  uh so I wanted to change the format  number function it's done it now it  wants to spit out everything in the  world like always let's just take a  format number here well it's doing this  little conversation I don't know if any  of this other stuff got fixed but let's  assume a format number was important  and let's just go right into changing  that and see what that gets us I've got  a feeling it's not going to change much  oh I see it changed this one to a  thousand  that probably fixed something at the  expense of something else  let's see how many tests we go through  now  uh it actually changed nothing in the  results so let's tell it that you still  failed all the tests  and let's see if it can uh handle that  that didn't help the same tests failed  foreign now chat GPT has a little bit of  an extensional crisis existential crisis  the problem is that the size parameter  is being divided by the maximum size for  the range it's interesting that if you  just keep telling it it's wrong I wonder  if you could keep telling it's wrong to  the point where it's right and you just  keep pushing it and it's like I thought  it was right but here's the problem now  and here's the problem this is where it  becomes a bit of a little a liar kind of  or a trigger  so get format size is now what it's  saying needs to change so let's just try  that we copy the new one  but it has it has a kind of confidence  that it probably shouldn't have it has  the confidence of uh  of a senior not really seniors that  don't have necessarily confidence not to  say that I'm one but  uh senior developer not a senior like an  old person necessarily okay what do we  get now is it more pass nope same ones  failed  so without looking at the code I kind of  like the back and forth of this but I'd  also like in the future if somehow you  could set up a better flow so it's like  able to run its own code you can just  give it a test like that would be a cool  thing in a minute I'll try giving it a  test and I'll be like well here's the  test can you just fix this let's say but  let's just try or yeah let's just do  that next let's just give it the code  for the test which I think is right here  and say Here's the test  so fix  the code so that it passes these tests  to fix the code so that it passes the  given tests  you need to update format number  function to correct criteria it's  interesting to think that it I mean it  understood that it got a test it ran  them what did it do with those tests  it's very hard to imagine  okay so let's let's see here it switched  format number and it switch get format  size  I don't know how it switched them  because I wasn't paying attention to its  suggestions  looks like there might have been a  subtle change but I'm honestly  questioning whether there was  let's let's do one more run of a test  here and see if we can get a little bit  better result  not really honestly  so chat gpt's got some real confidence  let's give it one more try  that didn't fix it  come on dude like figure it out but to  me this back and forth is just fun  honestly like it would be funner if it  was a little bit closer with its hits  and misses and that's where I that's  where I see the glimmer here that's  where I see that this is the future of  code but we're not quite there yet but  this back and forth is something I never  even would have considered with a  computer just last week and now it's  like why not just dump it any random  code I mean earlier I had tried with 800  lines where I just dumped the entire  function file and I just said give me  some refactor suggestions and right away  I was like you could try this you could  try that  I got another AI they're trying to talk  to me too  um  so it didn't finish the code but at the  same time here I think it was pretty  much off track so so what we're going to  do at this point is we're going to reset  the thread we're going to say that  trying to refactor code a little bit out  of context not checking it to try to  call it on every little problem that  it's added probably you're going to be  fighting with it probably this isn't its  best use case let's try some more  conversational stuff but stay with code  here going back to my project uh I mean  we got issues we got everybody's got  issues and I keep track of these issues  here and I thought it'd be fun to just  try to talk to it about some of these  problems and see like first off let's  just try literally pasting in this  problem  so let's just try this  uh I have a an open source project which  has an issue posted  here it is  can you help  and we'll just I mean I probably didn't  even need to give all of that preload  because it's just such a helper all the  time but let's anyways just dump this  and see I don't know about that build  log let's try not to dump the yeah let's  ignore the build log  let's just see oh and here's the build  log this guy posted here  let's just save this part here was the  best let's just give it that and see  what happens it's difficult to say why  your deployment is failing without more  information some things that you can try  include making sure that you have the  latest version of AWS so this is I mean  that's a good tip I never suggested that  to the person one little error that we  got that we can kind of clarify on is  this error here let me tell it that I  got the error  the root value has an unexpected  property Target let's see if it has any  suggestions if that happened because  this is the same thing here where  someone told me that or I had checked it  and it's like okay I don't know what to  do with that  uh hopefully Chach EBT does because I  don't think we actually solved this one  yet I think in the end I thought it  might be something to do with AWS deploy  and I did find some stack Overflow pages  to suggest that but it's good to get  that chat gpt's opinion on it the error  message the one I just posted usually  indicates that there's a problem with  amplify yaml  um it looks like the target property is  not a valid property yeah so that's that  was what kind of the AHA obviously uh  but it turns out that it's not even  configured so that's like another hmm  let's tell it that uh I thought this too  but the Target and property  is unset in  the repo  so what what does that mean dude what do  you think  and I'd like to be able to talk with  this slang like I'm saying repo instead  of repository uh I say Target but I  didn't put it in like code quotes but it  it knows Target like the variable not  Target like you're talking about some  kind of thing you want to point at if  the target property is not set in your  yaml file then it's likely that there's  another issue causing the deployment one  possible cause could be that you're  using an outdated version of again it  talks about the CLI so it's possible  that's the case I mean maybe I'll talk  to the person and suggest that so  they're right there there's one little  thing in the backlog where maybe I could  post a comment and maybe they could run  with that let's say boom okay we worked  on that one what's the next one here  uh changing from hexella's crashes  Safari uh okay so excellus is like a  graphical wallpaper let's just give it  like a real basic one there I think I  actually wrote something down here for  this one I have an animated background  using webgl that crashes Safari whenever  I close it why do you think that is I  never ran this com this question to see  what it gives as a result but that's  basically what's going on here uh and  you could give it more info and it's  gonna it maybe It'll ask some leading  questions it doesn't actually ask a lot  of leading questions that would probably  be cooler if it did it usually just says  it doesn't have enough information it's  kind of like hey you got a little  information for me yeah let's see what  it got here I'm sorry but I don't have  enough information on specific webgl and  Safari without more context it's  difficult yeah yeah see the problem is  in this case I don't have a lot of  contact so it's a tough one but it does  have a little bit information and it  looks like it tried to understand that  one  so we didn't get too far with that one  unfortunately either  um  if we were to look at like most of these  are I actually know the issues are and  they're actually kind of just like I  need to sit down and code them so these  ones you're probably not going to be  able to solve easily and then if I go  into the discussions here let's try to  have a discussion with chat GPT about  one of the discussions in here and just  see what it thinks  um add some little features so this  person here has requested this  let's let's see if I can get it to  respond as if it's me so respond  to  this discussion post  on my open source project  can I do that  I wonder if I have to tell it to respond  like as a person and I did respond to  this by the way so yeah I did say thanks  for suggestion etc etc but I wonder if  if it were to respond or if I were to be  like okay these are it wants some little  features like can it suggest any other  ones so it responded hello thank you for  the suggestion is that what I said  thanks for the suggestion that's how I  started it we appreciate your feedback  okay well it's not a customer support  so if I was like okay I don't have time  for all these but I want to give a few  seconds to try to spice this up a bit I  mean I would I would have some tweaks to  it like first off write this in the  first person oh wait did it do Daedalus  how did it now data list so was that  part did this person say it  thank you for being a fan of Daedalus  oh okay he mentioned it they mentioned  it there it's interesting that it was  able to call that out write this in the  first person  so it's it's pretty cool that it's able  to pick up on on these little things  like I didn't even notice that the name  of the app was written in there but it  picked that up and knew that oh that's  that's the project that he's talking  about up here  um so that one there isn't so much a  discussion I guess if we were to build  off of this this is why like you can  even word it as if you were talking to  him like pretend that this was something  he said to me and respond  uh but in this case it wasn't really  asked like for feature ideas maybe we  can we can try that though let's let's  try that so uh right uh response  from the commenter in  in which they have more feature requests  let's just prepare for more feature  requests by having  chat GPT imagine what this commenter is  going to request next  so I think that's what I'm asking like  this is where it gets meta what what can  we do with this thing what can be done  with language you know what can you just  tell it to pretend and what's like even  possible like I guess I could imagine  what this person would say is it  valuable to imagine it I don't know  thank you for considering my previous  suggestion I have a few more requests  for features that I think would really  improve data list first it would really  be great if you could customize the  background and color scheme of the OS  through the Settings app did this guy  call out any of that stuff how did how  did it know any of that  I didn't know it was an OS of any kind  interesting maybe because of the start  menu and the word icon secondly I think  it would be useful the Daedalus included  a built-in file manager well it already  does so  uh this commenter didn't know that it's  silly oh wait it's not a commenter it's  chatgpt imagining a person that I just  told him about a second ago  pretty crazy  so that's another thing you could do  with it I guess is you could have mock  discussions I guess in preparation for  the discussions tab  um that's just such a short little  example I don't want to get into too  many more but there's just some more  cool things you can do with chatgpt and  I just want to keep showing people this  the fluency the ability to just kind of  shoot ideas to it uh and here again was  in more of a code way where we're  talking about my side project we're  thinking about different things it can  do on that note I actually have one  other thing I thought I could do that  was kind of cool the other day where I  was just kind of explaining my side  project to it so my side project is a  desktop environment  in the browser  give me some suggestions to make money  with it  like hey why not I want to make money  and it's like here's a night here's what  I have here's the idea now I have my own  ideas where it's like well I could do  this or this but just having another  thing to say these things thoughts to to  have it come up with the ideas it's like  maybe my thinking's broken and I'm just  missing obvious stuff well so you can  just bounce ideas off of it like here it  is one way you could potentially make  money with your desktop environment in  the browser is by offering it in a pay  as a paid service well the you could  charge a monthly or yearly subscription  fee for users to access your desktop  environment okay you could also offer a  free version right additionally  incorporate okay that doesn't really  clarify what the features would be let  me let's let's build on this what would  be the key  features that  customers would pay for like that's kind  of important  again we're just bouncing off ideas it's  again related to code related to my side  project hey let's how to make money from  it  but just a second ago we were talking  about feature requests before that we  were dealing with the issues in the  issue board we were talking about  refactoring the code I mean you could  just come at it from any angle anything  that you want to talk about a thing with  you could do with Chad GPT so I've gone  back to code to kind of show like hey  I'm a coder here's I could use it for  code but it could be used for a lot what  do we got here some key features the  customers may be willing to pay for in a  desktop environment and the browser  would include increased storage space  faster performance and advanced security  features yeah those aren't bad ideas I  mean can we build more on that let's say  for the increased storage space  let's say  um  currently  All Storage is client side  how could I  offer increased storage space  right because it's not possible right  now because the browser is where their  storage space is  so the suggestions a little bit  off but maybe if I kind of call it out  or be like well how would that work  how I would imagine the response how I  would imagine it would work is you would  have to link it up with apis like  Dropbox or Google drive or something  like that what does it say here if your  current setup only allows for  client-side storage one way you could  offer increased storage spaces by  implementing Cloud stores that's what  I'm talking about this would involve  setting up servers that can securely  okay this would give users so let's say  I I don't want to run my own servers  I'm just gonna say that I don't want to  run my own servers like the the hint  there is like can I use any existing  servers apis like again like Cloud dry  uh sorry OneDrive Google Cloud  Dropbox whatever it might suggest that's  something I want to do in the future and  here we go here's it's suggesting  exactly that maybe not in the right  order but  I mean there you go like if it wasn't  for the fact that I knew about these  things because I thought about them  I Just Came Upon them basically in like  a three minute conversation with chat  gbt  um so again let's end it there that's  just some ideas happen to be code  related if you like this video please  throw me a like please subscribe to  motivate me keep it going keep these  videos going and yeah just to leave a  comment if you have any cool ideas for  my next video so thanks for checking it  out see in the next one
