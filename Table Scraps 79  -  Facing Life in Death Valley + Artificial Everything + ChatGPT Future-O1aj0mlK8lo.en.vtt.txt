 uh you know I worked hard on it  all right you should be good dog you  should be here we're live yeah we should  be live good to go all right hey  everybody this is table scraps what is  it 79. this is a certified that's what  this is oh [ __ ] that's a [ __ ]  certified Hood class dog it's gonna be  let me tell you first of all I want to  thank you for renting me this Tesla oh  you're welcome  I yo they're the exact it's like the  same price as any regular car and I was  supposed to get the model 3 and they by  mistake gave me the model X so I'm  chilling it it is that better than the  model 3 it's just bigger I don't [ __ ] I  just don't have it so it's like you know  yeah that's cool nice what uh car  company was that Hertz has it now I'm  switching to Hertz this is not an ad for  Hertz but I'm gonna tell you right now  like I'm gonna stick with Hertz when I'm  on the road to need to rent cars because  I'm gonna get Tesla's almost everywhere  probably everywhere is going to switch  they gave it to me 98 full you just got  to return to 80. it says 76 so when I  it's gonna take me 10 minutes that's a  rough one because the Chargers aren't  that close to the yeah and what sucks is  it's cold out so it runs so and and the  top of the batteries the the slowest to  charge that lasts 30 miles yeah right  there I didn't think about that yo but  um I don't even know where to start hey  man I first let's start with the fact we  haven't talked yeah so normally I mean I  do this but normally we you come in town  I pick you up we talk we have dinner we  do all kinds of [ __ ] and we get all  kinds of things out of the way and then  it's hard to talk about them in real  life because we both heard it so so this  time fresh off the plane yeah car rental  into the Pod turbulence heavy on the way  in they warned us about it but I am just  getting used to it from what it's nice  as [ __ ] out I don't [ __ ] know dude  just on the way down from the mountains  as you found a plane they're like uh we  got this flight yeah this plane is not  really good for that just tell them to  be turbulence it'll be fine maybe it's  the whole ride down which is brown  announcing and I was like oh but I I  I've been Uber driving a little and I uh  what wait wait wait wait does this have  anything to do with the turbulence well  I've been driving a lot of Pilots around  so I'm asking questions all the time now  okay I'm asking everything that I fear I  just ask them like I'm like uh you know  well I'm like you know I met a dude  that's a Top Gun F-16 fighter pilot  um what fears do you do you uh portray  to this man like I just said so the  contra's gonna come in the middle I said  you know like you know you feel I said  so you must you ride on the Jets he said  there's no turbulence in a jet in a in a  fighter Jam because of how they're built  they're so [ __ ] tight it just cuts  through everything okay but and then we  started talking about turbulence somehow  and I was like you know do you ever get  nervous on any plane at all and he goes  dude I took the whole commercial course  he said basically when you're taking off  there's a speed it has to there's a tiny  window between the speed it has to get  up to it where it comes off the ground  and then it's off the ground it's like  such a tiny Mark if anything's going  wrong while they're pushing ahead they  have room to stop  once they get off there's literally like  a millisecond window and then once the  plane is up  then even if you lost an engine or  something like that they could still  maneuver it and get you back down safely  because it's sliding at that point  basically yeah and you're up enough that  the engine is just to get you off the  ground yeah I mean if both of them  yeah but if you have one and you're off  to go so that little window I don't know  that was interesting but what does it  have to do with your fear I want to hear  about how you're supposed no my fear is  I just I don't love planes that that's  why all the [ __ ] time I love that  part of it that's why I tweeted all the  way here I love the airport an  interesting story about that we'll get  to it remind me I will got your Tweet  okay well yeah I just because I'm  thinking like I'm walking through it as  busy as it is first of all this is the  first time in my life I'm flying in the  same day  nothing literally just walking through  with a while yeah yeah it feels good I'm  gonna keep doing this dog okay I'm Gonna  Keep Coming might as well I mean your  idea of an office is just your idea of  an office if you can get work done on  the plane it doesn't matter yeah and get  work done here like if I come for a few  days you should be able to do it if you  have the freedom to get on a plane and  go have lunch in Atlanta while also  doing your work getting your work done  why the [ __ ] aren't you doing shout out  to Rodrigo Blankenship  we hung out with him in Atlanta  wrong one I even labeled him I just  can't see it from here  yeah shout out to Rodrigo yeah good I  don't have any Pro Sounds he left a cult  there's no uh there's no like Victorious  sounds in here you know we'll do it for  next time yeah I just want everybody to  know there's no  maybe that's like a Rorschach test that  I have no no you're not sharing I did  put a new sound in very  period my favorite that's my favorite uh  Sound business it's a girl doing that  weird thing yeah have you seen the  goddamn song no you haven't seen the  official period uh period uh track no  I'll have fun fun we'll check it when we  get offline but let me tell you some  dudes wrapping their hearts out anyway  go ahead sorry I no I just got so I got  really yesterday was insane for me okay  so we're done with the turbulence yeah  that's all over there with the fearful  questions that we got I had such no I  had such a what the fear is just flying  in general as much as I like it but all  you've said is how much you love it I  love going places but dude it is scary  there's no control flying it used to be  it gets less and less it's not making  any sense I'm not alone here because I  felt really good today but I also feel  really good today because of yesterday  what are you talking about dude I I I I  I have mushrooms we need an amount uh it  was like 1.25 to 1.5 okay in in Death  Valley for the record I haven't eaten  mushrooms in like two months just sorry  yeah well for the record I haven't  really been micro dosing but what I've  been doing is these kind of like doses  that aren't huge but like a half in  between a half maybe once every three to  four weeks you know what I mean like not  not that regularly because because it's  intense yeah because it's not you I mean  everything dude everything in life is  you use it as a tool and if you become  reliant on it it's you're you're lost in  it yeah so I agree or to just you know I  don't want to judge anybody grasp your  head there's so many people though that  like it's just become like a party thing  and they don't realize like the real  power behind it if you like I don't fall  into an ego trap though bro it's not an  ego trap but do whatever they do I mean  that's what I said I'm not judging them  but when you're saying about using it I  think there's but it can't it's not that  much of a party drug because it it  molecularly takes over then they're not  even judging them  I'm just saying there's nobody on this  planet who can eat a [ __ ] half ounce  of mushrooms and go party no no no at  some point not like that but a lot of  micro using over yeah they're micro  dosing and partying or whatever getting  like a little buzz it's cool though but  I just I'd rather not be around anybody  I'd never even a friend that I really  trust and like I don't think I it's got  nothing to do anything we've talked  about this before yeah maybe we have  yeah but yeah I don't I don't find it to  be a social drug whatsoever yeah so so  Brandy is like I gotta go shoot a  wedding in Death Valley I'm gonna go  down there do you want to come for the  day it's a long drive I'd rather have  you come with how far that's in  California yeah and dude because of  there they don't have any charges out  there we had to rent a car because they  they don't yeah it was brutal and nobody  left yeah exactly because so we ran we  read an Audi A5 convertible damn son for  first again for nothing it was [ __ ]  68 like I remember when I was a kid  you'd be like an Audi A5 would be like  I'm [ __ ] bawling everything every  every Legacy item or an institution is  crumbling sir yeah I'm looking at this  thing I'm like this thing's whatever  you're gonna see McDonald's golden  arches and crumbles there's gonna be

her I'm gonna go into Death Valley and  I'm like part of me is like most the day  I'm spending with her like we got there  super early to scout out all these spots  but like let me tell you it's not like  Death Valley this little Park like  the park itself yeah it's like 100 200  miles like from one end to the other you  could be taking an hour just in the park  so I'm like we can't take the Tesla we  go there we get there yeah like Yosemite  or something or Yellowstone or something  huge  so and in your mind you just thought  like it's something you drive through  like the past going to the mountains  yeah okay yeah but it was just monsters  there was a certain section we stayed to  and she's like look I'm gonna you know  we we walk these two different hikes and  we saw this beautiful point  and then she's like here's I'm going to  take the couple here here and we're  going to end on this point it's Sunset  so I'm like okay this could be a wedding  photography scenario or this could be  one of those like murder things you  watch  hold on you have no idea it's against  fire here because I didn't either so I'm  like in the desert I'm like I'm gonna  bring these mushroom candies and this  particular bar my friend was like who  who like my plug form was basically like  hey man I'm gonna give you this bar like  I don't know the mushrooms they use in  this one are really good like it's you  know something else yeah so I'm like all  right I take it with me I'm like I don't  know if I'm gonna have time I'm gonna be  with Brandy even with Brandy I don't  want to be doing it you know walking  around like a chick [ __ ] chirping at  you when you're trying to talk to the  aliens bro exactly anybody got time for  that oh [ __ ] I said it out loud yeah my  bad so  um so we get there God just start I'm  just trying to keep it together you're  fine man take your time we got all day  yeah you know yeah then all day it's our  life you just tell your story it's true  I'm here to listen yeah take a sip man  there's no sometimes we get live it  feels like there's a gun to your head  because you're like I want to be  entertaining but like well besides not  talking we have more balls than anybody  else we do it live I like that we need  the Riley [ __ ] do a lot of wheat yeah  but people not even Joe Rogan does it  live no it's my son you know yes I don't  know yeah he's yeah do a live Rogan see  you do that he's constantly he's getting  himself Mr edit yeah we'll get to it  anyway good  um  so we get there and then Brandy's like  here's the plan so I'm like okay listen  it's about 10 miles up the road from  like where their Campground is I'm like  drop me at this point and there's like a  trail a two mile Trail and I'm like I'm  gonna walk and I got the candy bar and  I'm like if I get off the trail and  there's little dip offs maybe somewhere  I could chill  maybe I'll eat these so you needed a  place to be by yourself to eat them like  they're doing it no they don't work like  Popeye spinach you don't get to just eat  them and then be like oh well no nothing  works like you wanted to let me tell you  right off the bat and this is the thing  about it these things take you and they  teach you because you're not there's  there was literally so I had this whole  plan so like I start walking and I find  and there's like these beautiful like  hilly looking things pills yeah but like  the size of this like almost like pills  that you would get on as a kid for King  of the Hill are we sure monsters are we  sure that these Hills are this big or  this is after we ate the mushrooms these  are this big it's a very known I can  show you a picture so you can if you  want it's a yeah it's actually it's on  my Instagram so people I think I  retweeted when Brandy shared it these  these kind of hills  those don't even have eyes let me see  you gotta hold your thumb on it or it's  gonna be the next thing  see it's like these like these wavy  Hills and you walk over that yeah you  can you kind of walk in between them but  you can walk up them but they're kind of  softer right yeah it's like rock but  it's also kind of soft it's weird so  okay  I like find one and my ass is like I  know what I'm doing I'm gonna Brandi  leaves me I thought my headphones are  charged I put in my headphones I might  put on some music I eat them I the  minute I eat them headphones oh no and  I'm like no I'm like I'm in the middle  of nowhere there's no cell phone service  it's like nope yeah and I'm like okay  this isn't meant to be well in the long  run it wasn't because the thing about  Death Valley is once you get out in  those Trails I'm telling you dude The  Sound of Silence like there's no animals  burning so you didn't eat them no no I  didn't okay I ate them and as I already  ingested them they was like okay and I'm  like [ __ ] so I'm like whatever it is  what it is and then I realize I'm like  it's really silent I mean  uh silence like you've never heard I'm  not scared of The Quiet is that what  you're right no I kind of liked it I  mean it was an experience it added to  the whole experience in the long run so  I'm glad the headphones went but then I  sit on top of this hill and I'm like I'm  gonna sit here like I'm meditating and  just look out and enjoy the [ __ ]  nature that doesn't take it off soak it  all in yeah boy was I wrong oh no that  is not where these things were trying to  take me so I'm like sitting there  looking and then like I see some dude  like run down a hill and he's just like  running this path but he like looks like  some sort of cop or something and I'm  like all paranoid yeah this is gonna be  a day you have no idea where my life  went this thing goes up and down yeah  well I'm like what is this guy doing so  I'm like I'm getting down from this hill  I I I don't even want to be looking at  people there's a guy like running in  this direction I don't know what the  [ __ ] he is I get down and like I walk  and I dip down this other trail that  kind of loops around then I start  walking and then they like because I was  up there kind of looking at the  mountains until they started like  kicking in and that's when I started  being like oh maybe I don't want to look  at the mountains maybe I just want to  look at the [ __ ] crowd maybe like  maybe I just want to look at the ground  and do absolutely nothing  so oh [ __ ] how are you gonna look at the  ground for like five six hours I don't  know when you're with people aren't you  there to work  you're not gonna help Brandi no oh  you're just there you're on your own  Journey okay you left me and my  headphones in the candy bar  for a second I hate cutting off them you  can just come back  no Brandon's got Brands doing pictures  she's like 18 miles up the road because  that's an important part of the start  off this is basically like war zone yeah  this is basically you know like you've  just been dropped off it's Warzone with  mushrooms she dropped me off at two  o'clock and and was like I'll be back  between 4 45 1500 hours young man it is  sweet she dropped me off at two o'clock  and said I'll be back between 4 45 and  no later than 5 15 we're gonna come up  here for the sunset take the final  pictures they're gonna go off in their  car and you and I will get out of Death  Valley I have no cell phone service I'm  like fine that works you know we we know  so you have no way to communicate with  anyone and you took drugs it was kind of  good now there's cops well he wasn't a  cop but it started kicking in and I  started walking I dipped down this Trail  that I'm like walking and I'm alone and  it's silent and then I'm like oh these  are kicking and I'm like I gotta sit  down I'm like I can't I'm not like in a  walking mode dude again this is only  like half a dose but whatever sometimes  it'll get you yeah yeah and that's what  I said I haven't really been doing them  that much so then when I did dude it  [ __ ] got me so all of a sudden I'm  sitting at the ground and I'm looking  sitting on the ground and I'm just  looking down and all there's these rocks  that are that are like layered it looks  like a million little layers you know  what I mean I think that's like  sedimentary I love pretend like I have  no idea it's like a Butterfinger and I  lead to guess and it like cracked off  and I was like oh that sucks like I  don't want to crack any of this oh man I  start looking at it and then I start  looking at the Rocks  and I'm like dude this yes  no but I start like all of a sudden I'm  just like really alone and it's really  quiet and I'm like yo yeah you said that  yeah but I'm like it hits me you know  like I'm sitting there on the ground and  I'm looking at this bush the only life  around is this bush that's dead it's in  the Rock and The Rock but nothing like  no Greenery no the in silence and just  this [ __ ] Bush that's dead and I  start thinking all these like dark let's  hear them dog let's go no I'm just  trying to talk about I'm thinking about  his death you know well yeah so I'm just  like yo I'm just like man this is like  out here like I guess it's okay to be  dead but like it I'm like this is just  it feels lonely like put that on your  Tombstone it's okay to be dead that  would be sick yeah  that'd be like the best Tombstone ever  yeah so far so good  no it was so then then so I'm thinking  about this I gotta I gotta yeah keep it  again man if you need to take a sip of  your drink slow it down yeah  so I'm I'm sitting there and I'm  thinking about like how alone it is and  like usually if I'm like this in this  kind of level of  shroom I like if you're looking at a  plant you can like kind of feel it alive  and you can feel the life in it and it's  kind of like to me brightens things up  this thing was just like really bringing  me down I'm like oh my God you're in  Reaper of strawberry yeah there's no  sound dude I cannot emphasize enough  that the no sound thing in the  background of this so like everything's  dead there's no sound there's not even  the wind blowing sound I mean I got it  dog it's silent I hear you I hear you  crazy and I'm like yo this is [ __ ]  like every crunch I make on the Rocks  I'm like this shit's crazy  I'm thinking about that and then I hear  a crunch like from way far and I look  and there's these three people  dude I light up I'm like oh people  humans yeah I'm like this is oh this is  and they're like hey how are you in a  place  hello I'm like just enjoying the nature  out here just enjoying the nature and  they're like do you look very Zen I'm  like oh I am yeah that's a word for it  and I'm sitting there in like the minute  they walk by I'm just like right back to  the bush and I'm like I'm like man this  is dark  extend like my so then my so when my  phone falls out of  my pocket and then I'm looking at my  phone and then I'm looking at these  stones and then I'm looking at my life  and then I'm like imagine if it was just  me and these Stones I would have never  been able to make it's like an evolution  there's like somewhere and somewhere in  that same spot  how if thousands of years ago there was  some [ __ ] Neanderthal just looking  into a stone and you were that but  you're looking into a phone that's when  I rhyme so you're like Stone and phone I  didn't so we do we look at our phones we  go we do we just throw it I and I'd even  look at it like I didn't want to open it  I wasn't on the missing link dude I I  but the thing is I started thinking like  I've been reading all these books and it  talks about how like  nothing is really of itself it'll always  say like yourself we're all wanting the  same people and like you know you hear  that but you're like yeah I'm awesome  myself like I have to you know well I  think the idea is you share a  Consciousness not that you know yeah you  know when someone else farts you feel it  but like the phone it was something  about the phone and the rocks and I'm  looking at the Rocks I'm like I couldn't  make this phone like if right now I was  the only person on earth oh yeah I just  had to make sure you need other people  from scratch and I'm like and I start  going into this like yo you need other  people like even my enemies like I need  everyone to do good we all need to do  better as a people and I get like this  overwhelming feeling about that and I'm  just like oh my God like my mind is  blown for a minute and then that's like  the deepest from a rock that's the best  from a rock in my [ __ ] phone and I'm  just dude at this point I'm like on the  ground like on my side like looking at  the photo The Rock like I'm telling you  this thing [ __ ] hit me and I'm like I  don't even care if people walk by like  going on  yeah I'm just like yeah I'm just like  this is people are like did he get bit  by a poisonous snake or no I just say  something at one point I tried drawing  in the sand like I I don't even know  what I was drawing I'm like I want to  draw something with this little rock and  I'm like I can't draw I'm like yeah who  cares this is fun this is how you should  feel about drawing who cares it is fun  for sure but uh it was and then what I  did I draw a human's face and then I  start going man I really just I want you  know we are all together and even my  enemies and everybody that I get  stressed about and names that I will  leave unknown but like people that like  I look at and I'm like God why are they  [ __ ] idiots but and I tried to get  not to get mad and so it's all a  counterbalance like you need like even  as frustrated as we get it like the  internet [ __ ] we talk [ __ ] about we kind  of need it just so we can express  ourselves anyway you know yeah I would  hate to be one of the people who chose  Assad you know I'd much rather be  tortured by it thinking everyone's  [ __ ] stupid than being like well I'm  on this side so [ __ ] you I'm like well  you're all [ __ ] stupid yeah if you  walk if you've seen that new HBO  a little documentary from the channel 5  news guy oh I started my name the other  night the one without Andrew Callahan  yeah yeah I started it yeah and then  like I don't I was so tired it's like  that if you walk away from that movie  yeah and you're like I'm on this side or  that side you've completely missed the  point well that's why I like his stuff  because sometimes like I I see something  that looks super political like that and  I'm like I don't even want to watch it  no he does a good job this shit's gonna  trigger me but the minute it started I'm  like I get it he's talking he just lets  people talk but he's doing Street  interviews like but he does interesting  and he just kind of you know the first  thing he started was how everything is  divided and the media pushes that so  right we don't have to talk about the  doctor yeah yeah because we got to get  back to the desert last thing I want to  do is review the [ __ ] movie yeah but  anyway go ahead  um I just have so much to say so the  presidential position desert yeah and  I'm just like and I'm looking at this  phone and the rocks and I'm just like  thinking all these things and then like  once you get through that initial kind  of first hour  yeah I'm like  you know you're in another world and  then all of a sudden then [ __ ] gets cool  like then I look up at the clouds and I  happen to look at the like I just look  upwards and I'm like oh the clouds are  crazy they're all blown then I start  thinking of dragons then I'm like now I  see how artists like I know how people  ancient people they were probably even  mushroom people I mean like [ __ ] like  ancient like Asian culture I mean like  these dudes that had dragons and their  mythical things if they were doing  mushrooms or any kind of psychedelics at  some point I didn't even need mushrooms  or psychedelics they didn't have TV  media radio barely talk to anybody  people from way back in the day would do  psychedelics yeah sure but I'm saying  you didn't even need it I'm saying there  was nothing else going on there's  nothing else in the sky yeah that's why  people thought yeah  yeah totally and do but I mean the  clouds just look so crazy then it was  just you know the regular I don't need  to go into the details  you know everything was really I mean  there wasn't too many more big like  Revelations that were felt life-changing  from that point on I was just like  everything is beautiful the [ __ ] Sky  out here is beautiful every day I felt  like I went through it figured something  a regular mushroom trip yeah sounds like  it sounds like a standard mushroom yeah  to me so yeah yeah it wasn't but here's  where it gets dark all right let's go 4  45 like it's perfect timing too like I  just I finally look at my phone I'm like  oh 15 minutes that's about how long  it'll take me to get back Brandy will be  there  get there Brandy's not there and I'm  like all right well you know the price  she always runs late she's the worst  with timing especially out here with uh  in the desert she doesn't really know it  sounds [ __ ] fired yeah well then  then like and but they're not even here  to take the photos it's not like so then  five o'clock comes and what are you  talking about you're like going so fast  so so Brandy was separated stop I got  that everyone knows this part okay all  right so let me just let me just  condense this because you're just saying  [ __ ] without finishing your sentences  you are now meeting back up with Brandy  who is separated from you she's not  there yeah what happens now well then 15  minutes go by she's still not there okay  now it's 5 15 and like the park is  emptying out and it's like dark okay  like it's Joe Dirt level at this point  you're about to get left yeah well  that's what I think or I think something  was wrong with her and I'm like there's  no cell phone service like it is called  Death Valley yeah so then I'm like oh  this is not good then it's like 5 30.  and it's like dude it's pitch black and  I'm in the middle of just this so I  asked one guy there's like one truck  sitting there this like old dude and I'm  like hey do you mind just waiting a  second because that because I'm scared  and my parents aren't here yet no but  dude if I had to like call and get help  or like no yes I got it first of all I'm  still on I'm not sure because I don't  have to defend yourself it's still funny  no it is funny it's amazing but dude I'm  freaking out because dude I'm still  tripping like the trip was I'm walking  up the hill like oh I can't wait to see  Brandy and her and and the couple she's  taking pictures with say hi to everyone  and I'm so loved like I'm in this like  happy world now United yeah yeah and  then you're faced with and then she's  not dead yeah and I'm like what the [ __ ]  and then like you know the road is like  a mile that you can see all the way down  it so I don't see any cars and you see  one coming you're like oh this has to be  hard I'm like she wouldn't leave me here  in the dark like the plan was between 4  45 and 5 15. it's now 5 30. I love these  thoughts these thought bites like she  wouldn't leave me here in the door yeah  I'm just you know like  dude it was terrifying I'm gonna tell  you it was terrifying my trip of love  and happiness went from as I'm just  thinking like whatever you do love  everybody and don't get mad at people  I'm like I'm gonna [ __ ] kill her if  she's okay it's not even old enough it's  not even late enough for [ __ ]  trick-or-treating hours and you're  terrified  doesn't matter what's gonna happen  scared though that's what I was scared  of okay and not being able to contact  her Drake of you but I don't really no  that's the truth there's a they had a  bathroom there no there's a bathroom  there in a building if I want I could  have sat in the bathroom if I was scared  that wasn't it it was that the closest  like park ranger thing or anything there  was an inn down the road in Death Valley  it's about six miles up so I'm like if  there's a person so in your mind what  did you think happened to her  what was your first thought what did you  think happened  an accident or something but what was  you didn't picture anything or do you  think she just rolled off the side of  the Hill uh well dude it's it's wild I  want to know what your brain thought I  don't I don't know yeah I don't know I  don't a million thoughts I think it's  more than what you're just like you  could you get an accident did did you  leave me no she told me it's over it was  never like she just left me out here no  it was never like that I really thought  something was wrong I'm like this just  isn't like her and then a million  thoughts you're like you know could  could these people have been some creepy  people that she met up with and they  [ __ ] I don't know I was trying to get  to meet potatoes if you're if you're  dark yeah because I but you know but  they're all coming out at once and I'm  on mushrooms and I'm like huh I'm like  freaking out and I'm like huh excuse me  sir and he and I'm thinking this and  because I'm like very aware I'm like  this guy I look like a psycho like he's  an old dude in his truck with his wife  who's also older and I'm like excuse me  guys I'm like come over to the window  I'm like do you mind uh just waiting  here for a few minutes it's getting a  little dark my wife's supposed to pick  me up and I it would be you know if  somebody could wait just so if I need a  ride or something like that and he's  like yeah no problem and I'm thinking  like they probably would like I could be  some [ __ ] weirdo asking that you are  a weirdo it's not yeah  ask somebody to wait no I would have  used my rational thought I mean like  even if something's happened to her  there's nothing I can do about it right  now and I just need to get and wait and  see what happens I wouldn't freak out I  freak out and I mean I get I don't know  I mean I guess you don't have a ride out  of there so that's like part of it dude  the next like thing other than that in  especially that way you're only 30  minutes she's only 30 minutes late at  this point 45. okay it's really which  yeah but 45 of your phone's off but you  don't have service yes but the point is  is that the minute the sun goes down  which was 45 minutes earlier there's no  more photos to be taken so I'm like how  the furthest point she was for me was 20  minutes away she's not taking photos  once the sun's down because it's too  dark she's she was taking him at the  Sunset and ending it even if they didn't  come here at first I'm like all right  they didn't come here to do the sunset  shot she probably got stuck in one of  these other shots and it looked  beautiful or just went ahead and did so  you talked to this guy and I have him  waiting with me okay and then how long  before Brandy shows up fine unscathed  totally just like hey we ran a little  late just a few more minutes  but bro  I was freaking yeah because that's what  it is like mushrooms are not like that's  what it is people put themselves through  that's anxiety oh yeah in a nutshell I  mean it's condensed right or  concentrated right there but that's what  people go through and instead of just  like calming down and being like dude  everything is okay because that's all  you have to do on mushrooms when that  takes you to that place is just be like  everything is okay you know even if she  was far I mean unfortunately even if she  had fallen off the [ __ ] thing and  been impaled you're gonna be okay I mean  that's dark but like you will be okay  eventually so it's true there's just no  reason of putting yourself through it  because you're putting yourself through  it prematurely it's probably not gonna  happen but your body doesn't know it's  not maybe one day I'll figure that out  before you go I have faith it was not  good because I was freaked out there and  I knew like deep down I'm like I'm like  dude you're being [ __ ] crazy like you  got it but I'm not trying to portray  that I don't worry yeah you know I don't  want to like be like hey I'm so stoked I  don't even worry yeah I'm saying you  bugging out after like 45 minutes to an  hour like she's dead no it was bugging  out though dude it was like really like  I was like talking to the guy like  probably like shaky I was like hey you  know I don't want to bother you guys  what would you would you mind us just  sticking around because I you know I  think it and then like you'd be taking  I'm like trying to make combo with them  I'm like so where are you from he's like  oh New York I'm like hey me too we're  like talking I'm like hey I'm really  sorry about this like I I know this is  weird I and then as I'm like saying that  I'm like no no that sounds even [ __ ]  weird I'm like dude you gotta [ __ ]  chill I'm like Brandy's Gonna Come  so  thoughts went through my head but  actually what happened and I I think  again thanks to the revolution that I  had earlier in the day I was just like  you know what  this isn't her fault like she did say to  me like if you want you can come with me  and just hang while I do the shoot and  obviously  yeah so that was part of that it took  you everywhere yeah and I I said that  and I didn't get mad there was a minute  I got in the car she's like I'm so sorry  I'm like just give me a second don't  talk I'm still [ __ ] like yeah yeah  like  and now I'm seeing you I'm freaking out  I'm like I'm not mad at you I just need  a second [ __ ] well I just wanted just a  second that's so hard for them and then  my music my music I just like wanted my  music because it'd been forever  if no flocking doesn't come on I won't  feel like I'm  really chill I wanted like chill music  John Stevens but yeah maybe you like  that but she  oh it's so good it's amazing this is the  best part is that there's an Instagram  post of you and her sitting on a [ __ ]  Rock Island it's like love is the answer  so [ __ ] that's so earlier oh yeah I'll  tell you okay that's from the camera the  photo is but yeah she's not that's from  this morning because because I'm just  loving until I [ __ ] by Suicide yes  yeah and I feel extra loving that's cool  man  yeah that's [ __ ] funny no matter what  it's so funny I can't help it I and then  and then oh man it's funny because  somebody else from a past life I'm not  going to say names but I actually happen  to reach out this morning too on some  real apology [ __ ] and not that I want to  hang with him but I was just like it's  all good dude yeah no beef with it I  mean there's no reason to hold on to it  that's for sure you know I said I hope  you're doing well how he's like I just  I'm really sorry about the way I acted  for a lot of our life and like I just  went and I said hey man I as long as  you're doing good now good like I hope  you're doing well it doesn't matter  where you start it matters where you  finish yeah you gotta like I'm not mad  but if you're so when you're showing the  signs that you're not headed in that  direction you gotta expect people to  back off from you you know and then if  we come to you come too we'll spread  this love and keep the positive movement  you need the iPhone you need the future  and for the future you need all these  people to get along and then I start  thinking I mean my thoughts went all  over for that stuff like and then I'm  trying to explain it to Brandy in the  car and I must also sound crazy first I  told her how scared I was and she's like  she's like I left you a voicemail like  in case you got down to the end and got  service if I'm like what if I walk six  miles I'm like what at that point  but the other hard part is it's such a  big Park that if I left and she didn't  see me or came from another road maybe  she would go ahead and call it what it  is you were afraid of the name off top  no it was green and beautiful it would  have felt a little better but dude this  [ __ ] was dark and and you got it's got  years and years this [ __ ] was a [ __ ]  one of those think tanks like one of  those float tanks basically I mean I'm  in the pitch black Nature's float tank  with no water pitch black no sound and  I'm just like yeah so just lay down you  do that every night in your bed what you  afraid of son I just because I was  worried about where she was that's what  you're telling yourself dude I wasn't  scared of like an animal there are no  animals out there you're afraid of some  the dark I was afraid of not being I was  afraid to not be able to get in touch  with her okay that's what it was uh I  could have made it through the night out  there like that wouldn't have been  that part I I thought I did that did  that because you would have been in the  corner shivering you wouldn't have  gotten a wink of sleep no no no  holding your knees shaking and looking  around no I was crying I would have been  in that bathroom yeah just sitting there  meanwhile Brandy's asleep in the car  because she got a flat tire and didn't  know how to change it  [Music]  was that your phone  is it your phone it's not my phone where  did that just come from is it your  phone's there  or is it  yeah how did that even happen I don't  know that was wild sorry I was like  where's that coming from  well you got out it was a real up and  down trip and then uh  rolled out of Death Valley but dude it's  I mean the other thing is like you are  just where we were 71 miles in the  desert with not no service and no  nothing around the end is the only thing  around that has a little bit of service  and there's like a park ranger thing out  there but like all of that is like 18  miles I mean the end was like six miles  this isn't really that scary dog it was  scary when you're on mushrooms only  other people do Everest and [ __ ] there's  no cell service yeah but these people  train I'm out here just like on some  [ __ ] spiritual journey  yeah but I had it went from beautiful  like I'm watching the sun set and like  slowly getting creeped out like this is  amazing but where's Brandy I mean again  that's mushrooms man it's just getting  darker it's it's just a reminder of the  things that you care about it's it's  cool it is is it is that it for the  mushroom journey I think that's it  um  well yeah we have so much I don't even  know the last he always says this we  have so much to talk about why is the  last time that I was saved right my face  was shaved completely it was like two  months we skipped December because you  were so busy so we haven't even talked  when I went to Amsterdam we did I think  you talked about it a little bit last  time some people said I interrupted you  too much because you're talking about  but I'm like I've already heard it and  yeah you really just went on I I don't  like that people think  that tour life is really that  interesting you know it's like I get it  it's like being sound to a label when  people are like all right I just want to  get signed it's like well no you don't  you just want someone to help run your  business for you it's like people are  like oh tour life seems So Glamorous  it's not there's not that much I don't  feel like there's that much for you to  really share except it's like the shows  no the shows yeah  um I was talking about Belgium when I  went by myself oh wait you went back I  think you were going back I think yeah  so you were going didn't you come home  do the yeah you came home you did the  podcast because you stopped on your way  back to your house so I haven't that's  how long it's been yeah but it is but  but at the point of the Glamorous thing  like I love it because it's fun but the  moments of but like they're seeing the  cities but it's in very it's a  difference between coliseums though  you're seeing like the back room mostly  you're seeing the back rooms of  coliseums and you're traveling from  state to State mostly if you're doing  this if you're doing the amphitheaters  you rarely leave that yeah  except on off days but for me on and off  day I'm always still working so I'm just  saying that people every idea of  Rockstar life no matter what people have  a [ __ ] very silly idea of what it is  to put on any type of production oh yeah  they have no it's not glamorous like oh  you're you're barely sleeping and you're  sleeping in weird spots to make that  happen and a lot of waiting around yeah  all day especially as the artist like  the artist like if you're like a rapper  and you're I mean you literally well  actually that they probably just can go  see the city on their own yeah because  they don't have like a whole  orchestrated yeah whatever but like  you're a band like you're stuck there  you got to do your sound check you gotta  do your crew has to make sure  everything's good it's like real work  yeah yeah and then if you have to like  you do you know you do a meet and greet  or you do some sort of signing or so  like there's always and you're out of  the love for the fans and this is what  you're there to do but what I'm saying  is an experience for  to just go like when people are like man  you're living the dream I'm like dude  it's exhausting oh it's even when we  toured for sneaker cons and [ __ ] it's  like dude this [ __ ] is [ __ ]  exhausting it's not but nothing is fine  being at home in my opinion at this  point in my life see I I don't I I don't  think  I feel like it's because and I feel like  this is about myself is because my lack  of being able to go inward the feelings  that I would have going to Japan  I can now get by just going inward I  don't need that place because what I was  doing was allowing myself to feel that  when I got there yeah I would like let  myself let all this [ __ ] go yeah because  I'm in Japan like oh now you're playing  the part so it's almost like set and  setting like oh I put myself in a new  setting so now I can do this but like  yeah man I feel like I can do that I can  do that at king supers that's a grocery  store here I can do that anyway I can do  the gym and that I think is the truth  not to say that people shouldn't like oh  just go inward you don't have to go  anywhere no I've done it and now I  realize what the essence of that is and  post covet I ain't going [ __ ] nowhere  because you're all [ __ ] crazy and I  can finally say it because I've been  trying to say it for years you're all  [ __ ] crazy yeah crazy yeah it is  crazy God damn it now we're about to  [ __ ] go after The Foundry boy I've  been waiting two years to talk [ __ ]  about this [ __ ] I know I am the  wait I'm waiting I have two because I I  don't you even  started not in the beginning yeah  [ __ ] she was getting carried away and  like the rules honestly especially after  I got stuck in Budapest because I had to  test to come home and I'm like this is a  [ __ ] joke now you don't have to test  to come home what the [ __ ] is the  difference it depends on where you are  it depends on which country depends on  which yes  depends on this depends on that depends  on is China going to invade uh [ __ ]  Taiwan or Russia versus ucraft depends  depends depends oh vaccine vaccine  vaccine  it is necessary come on all right hello  dude hey what's on your mind no I'm  sorry go that's another good point that  I noticed right away it was so funny  when I came home from the whole trip and  like we got back home and I had to  return the rental car  I stopped at the gas station and at at  Terrible's gas station they have those  TVs on the [ __ ] thing and I'm still  kind of like Zend out and just  everything you know I just kind of went  quiet and I'm just kind of like chilling  coming like I came down kind of tired  and like I hit the gas and I turned and  it's like hello today you're and I like  jumped and I'm like what the [ __ ] and  the thing's just like today we have and  right in your face at a gas station  where you're driving Bud Light and you  see some kid take the Bud Light six pack  and hold it up and it like zooms into  the camera and it's like right now for  only 3.99 foreign  I I don't want to like you were saying  everybody like needs love like I'm gonna  forgive everybody for the last three  years I'm not gonna hold people to like  being confused and scared yeah but it's  hard like it's hard not being like man  how I ever said this whole time was just  to [ __ ] chill out and listen and wait  and this and that I know it's super  scary a lot of people died all this [ __ ]  happened but the whole point is that the  [ __ ] government went through  advantage of [ __ ] yeah and took  advantage of clear business [ __ ]  goddamn hand clear he has hands in just  about everything well dude fauci has  hands I mean his wife that everything's  intertwined the FDA and him and  everything was so good everything is so  in her [ __ ] thing  it would make sense now again you call  conspiracy theories whatever a lot of I  mean this would make sense that he would  control this [ __ ] this way it's just I  don't even I do care about that but my  [ __ ] whole thing is like everybody  just picks [ __ ] sides so quickly  without just stepping back and watching  it all play out like I never knew but I  do know that I never felt more [ __ ]  goddamn conflicted to get a vaccine or  not get a vaccine like the fact that I  had to even think about it as much and  so many people talk about it pressured  me into it yeah I'm just like  yeah I mean I'm glad I made the decision  that I made yeah and I know a lot of  people who made different decisions and  that's their [ __ ] prerogative but  like the whole thing just seems like it  turned everybody against each other yeah  and now they're stuck in it so now when  [ __ ] happens with like Andrew Tate or  whatever the [ __ ] yeah people are just  so [ __ ] quick to pick sides and it's  a symptom of their [ __ ] up brain and I  I know girls who are like Anthony founds  you can spit in my mouth and I'm just  like you're a [ __ ] idiot that's like  weird yeah it's like a dumb [ __ ] like  just the  the  the [ __ ] like joining of the badge or  like I stand for this like this whole  [ __ ] I'm so glad we get to talk [ __ ]  about it yeah I'm just glad we get to  comb through it look through it for what  it is and talk [ __ ] about it as we live  through it because I'm not gonna be  silent about anymore she's so [ __ ]  annoying dude people were so [ __ ]  annoying during this time I drove me  insane yeah yeah but I don't I don't  know if it's gotten any better I think  the internet is still pinned against  each other they are pinned against each  other but at least with [ __ ] Elon  buying Twitter and at least with their  being [ __ ] exposed about what actually  happened we at least get the truth that  ain't stupid enough to think we have any  control dog I ain't trying to like  make any changes because they know  they're going to happen I just want to  know  what [ __ ] happened that's it if this  fool is doing [ __ ] some goddamn  Doctor Octopus [ __ ] research trying  to do some [ __ ] and got out I want to  [ __ ] know about it that's it if if a  [ __ ] virus leaked and yeah economies  have crumbled and people [ __ ] died  [ __ ] I want to know about it I don't  wanna I don't want this whole like well  we all just need to be soft about it no  for the record I think I think that's uh  the thing right now is like I feel the  same way with a lot of this stuff if if  Twitter if social media things are  withholding information I don't care  what side it is if they're taking a side  it's scary and I want to know how bad it  is so it's like and what's scary is that  people don't stop to like [ __ ] the  institution for doing it they're gonna  do it McDonald's gonna serve fries you  don't have to eat them and that's the  [ __ ] problem is that you're the  people like our friends and and people  we don't know and all like any topic you  look at [ __ ] are just like the  heels dug in talking [ __ ] with well  little [ __ ] connection to someone and  it can't be them or their side so it  just automatically both sides point to  face and it is it's so much that people  are pointing the finger at each side  no matter what the issue is nobody  that's why there's very few people that  I feel like do just uh look at both  sides or at least that's what the  internet makes it feel like it because  well internet convinces both sides are  winning no matter what side you're on  when you're on the internet your side is  winning every comment you see based on  the algorithm is telling you you're  winning like oh look at that oh Andrew  Tate got caught by the pizza boxes no he  didn't yeah but it doesn't matter  because the Fable is cooler than the  truth and like yeah and then the [ __ ]  [ __ ] I don't even know what to call  them anymore the [ __ ] uh Mohawk green  hairs are like look he got caught become  this big Petty [ __ ] [ __ ] fight  well it's kids and the media is pushing  it or the the social media whatever it  is that that pushes it out there the  irony of some of this [ __ ] it's like  Andrew taping a perfect example dog if  this [ __ ] didn't go down and the whole  internet had to have an opinion on it I  wouldn't even know who yeah  honestly I don't think I'm mad about it  maybe I'm old maybe I don't look at the  internet that much but I don't no he  gained it dude he [ __ ] he  I don't agree with some of the things  sometimes the [ __ ] he says is profound  and true people just don't like it  because of the package it comes in but  it's also a symptom of the [ __ ]  internet because people won't accept  [ __ ] that isn't I said this in my  monologue last time the people won't  accept [ __ ] that's not pro wrestling  caliber so if you don't come out as a  super villain or a superhero you don't  stand out you just don't the only reason  I stood out with sneakers is because I  look like I was homeless yeah I came out  with a gold two long hair and a beard be  like who the [ __ ] homeless guy behind  sneakers that's what stood out it grabs  you yeah that's it so you grab people by  saying all this [ __ ] Outlander [ __ ]  yeah and people can't help it and he  incentivized people he paid people for  sharing his videos and creating content  with his videos yeah so he used the  symptom of people who can't put their  [ __ ] phone down who have to respond  to everything yeah they made money off  of it yeah it does not matter whether  you love or hate it it makes money here  yeah that's the only I'm gonna be honest  it's the only reason reason that I've  been putting out all this extra [ __ ]  like the clips and stuff is like I'm  doing a project where I'm seeing what  gets attention on the internet and so  far the clips that get into the 30 and  40 000 views are political as [ __ ] yeah  the ones that don't get anywhere are art  yeah no one cares what does that tell  you about [ __ ] people I mean I'm just  one person but he's crazy if you ask  artists if they can make any traction on  the internet these days most of them are  going to tell you no if you ask someone  who's a political pugman how much  traction they get talking [ __ ] yeah  they're gonna get a lot that's the  symptoms same as Andrew Tate I don't  follow the government I don't follow  like this whole Speaker of the House  Kevin McCarthy whoever like I dude I  have zero idea what's going on I don't  even I'm just a new speaker right yeah  but the only reason I even know that is  no matter what I unfollow everything  that's like political and I don't want  to see  someone either likes it or follows them  that I can't escape it you can't escape  it there's no so the Escape is putting  the phone down that's it well that's  right or just not care like I look and I  go new speaker doesn't matter yeah I  don't I'm not even going to read the  article I don't care I don't care why  sometimes read my comments just to see  what [ __ ] ridiculous [ __ ] I'm gonna  see so I can just be like all right  whatever yeah none of it's ever going to  matter that's where people have gotten  confused though because every day it's  just a fight a fight a fight yeah and we  don't have control what can I do what  what does my opinion matter I'm not  gonna that guy I'm not gonna change the  Speaker of the House for the next  however many years I don't know how many  years do they say it feels like Nancy  Pelosi was in there for a hundred years  yeah and now she's gone and he's in and  I don't know he's from the other side  imagine  picking any of them that's my imagine  you want to go to lunch with any of them  no no that's what I'm saying all right  so that you want to go launch with Eon  or fauci yeah yeah  I'm not talking about the [ __ ] Jay-Z  versus money I'm just saying if two  people ain't gonna go to lunch I'm like  I'm not going without you yeah something  clearly is yeah how we started this  something clearly went down yeah and I'm  just not excited but I am hopeful to  find out little nuggets of truth that  are gonna be hidden underneath tons and  tons of [ __ ] well I think it makes  us feel safe because the truth comes out  it's like it's safe but not safe but  safer in the fact that like somebody's  got to call these people out so they  don't just keep doing this [ __ ] you  can't just keep putting fouchies in and  putting people in positions when all of  a sudden everything's fine people are so  subordinate dude like they don't care  and people don't do the research they  don't go back to look and see what he  did during the A's they don't go back  and look at his whole career they don't  talk to others because who needs to  stand up to people when you can just  argue with each other over who did it  was right people did and then the  [ __ ] Twitter well that's what I'm  saying censored as [ __ ] and that's where  the shit's [ __ ] up that's not what I  say I see what you're saying so this is  where we're [ __ ] because  you we can make this podcast talking  about all kinds of things but if it  doesn't hit the [ __ ] algorithm rocket  it doesn't matter yeah the masses don't  [ __ ] search for anything anymore yeah  they don't even know how yeah it's  insane yeah and the [ __ ] AI [ __ ]  that's coming has got to change  everything yeah yeah some of this stuff  yeah that first video I watched it I've  seen some of the stuff we're talking  about Chad GPT that [ __ ] is insane yeah  like ins to so that's I'll go ahead and  talk about it because yeah you today you  tweeted I have it on my computer still I  think so you uh tweeted  I don't still have yours on here [ __ ] I  love the airport yeah actually I'll do  it live hold on let me find your Tweet  so there's all these different chat GPT  is this AI app that has been it's not an  app it's an AI that can be ingrained  into Apps and different programs  websites it can do all kinds of [ __ ] uh  there's this [ __ ] app called Merlin  I'm gonna keep calling them apps because  I'm too stupid to know any of this  shit's really called but I'm gonna call  it an app maybe that's what it is I  think it's a Chrome extension  but anyway uh  if I go to your [ __ ] tweet  damn it  it's happening here I don't know what is  happening I don't know how to use my  computer I know where you're going with  this do you where am I going it can  respond yes but like I so all right so I  have Merlin as a Chrome extension so all  I all I'm doing right now is I'm gonna  go on to your Twitter it says I Honestly  Love airports right  I highlight that I right click it I say  give context to Merlin and then I just  type in  Write a response  and then  you ready for this yeah Merlin gives me  the response of I'm glad to hear that  you love airports it's a great feeling  to be surrounded by the hustle and  bustle of Travelers and the excitement  of a new adventure wow and so like  wow yeah and so you can even that was  like better word than I could have said  exactly so here Write a response to this  like Yoda  love airports I do  which is simple as [ __ ] but at the same  time yeah that's a powerful fight so you  can you say write a mean response or  write a funny response here let's see  write a mean respawn  airports are the absolute worst the  lines were wrong the prices are too high  and the service is terrible you so  that's Merlin so you can go through and  you can do that on any way how does he  do the service is terrible how does is  this the overall like because ai's been  programmed so it's been it's been given  a language it has a program language  basically as far as my understanding if  I get anything wrong I'm sorry but  up until 2021 so all of time or what we  know up until 2021 it has to be  refreshed for anything that's happened  after 2021 but there's even extensions  now where it searches the web to update  itself there's another extension for  Google Chrome I can't remember the name  of it oh it's amazing but it adds to  chat GPT  and it will [ __ ] give you everything  so I mean are people gonna do work  emails like this like every [ __ ]  thing is about dude you've got to  understand the power and it's [ __ ]  like both sides of their I feel like I'm  back at the nft thing where I'm like I  don't know what's going on and I don't  know if I should side with it or not but  it's crazy  you know it's the same thing as the AI  art [ __ ] which  it all samples from what's already been  put out so without the original artist  it doesn't exist you know it has to have  something to draw from it has to have a  source which in a sense so do we exactly  but the difference is they have a much  bigger base this is the [ __ ] keep  turning on  it no it's not there yeah God  dude it's incredible dude I'm gonna  later like I have like a work email I'm  gonna re I'm just gonna write a response  to some of what people wrote to me and  just see what it says because that's so  interesting and you can go into just so  if you just go to chat GPT that's  Merlin's an extension yeah Chachi BT can  just go right into and ask it any  question anything you want you can have  it write to a paper you can have it I  mean you have it write a poem whatever  it'll do all kinds of [ __ ] they've  ingrained this and all kinds of things  like the art and everything you can SEO  is done I mean you can create this thing  can create you a thousand articles on  your topic search engine optimization  for those of you yeah so you can create  all those articles index the Articles  now you're top on Google search  you can create [ __ ]  um you could create a product for like  Amazon or something yeah you could  create hey I need a hundred positive  reviews for a candle  you could do all this you know what I  mean it's gonna change every [ __ ] you  can create video yeah it's insane and I  have just like a very very stupid  kindergarten understanding yeah well the  thing is if it's artificial intelligence  then it's like you said it's constantly  refreshing and learning it it's only  going to get better and better and  better and then it's going to learn from  itself you know what is cool I think the  art wise one those fashion things you  ever see any of them like I'm not into  fashion but they have these crazy just  the fact that this thing could take  ideas I don't know what you're talking  about they'll do like these Nike  backpacks that don't exist but like  it'll be it'll look like some backpack  out of [ __ ] Back to the Future like  yeah I mean there's another site called  uh doll.e yeah you can drop your own art  into and it'll give you a bunch of  different  art you know the app people are doing  their art on oh yeah yeah for free yeah  the only reason the app took off is  because it's an app and people are  [ __ ] lazy and it's you know just like  how it is  yeah yeah you can save it right on your  phone yeah but you could have gone to a  place like Dolly and just typed in  uploaded your photo and been like uh  dystopian in the ocean or whatever I  would have given you this crazy thing  um that's the same engine it's being  applied to all these things but my  question is this if AI makes  we'll say a video right because a I  could literally you could take a YouTube  video  copy the link have ai record everything  that [ __ ] just said come back  lay that [ __ ] over another video they  now have fake [ __ ] you can download a  fake person basically yeah that can read  that script where it looks like a human  you can change the background you can do  whatever you want you make a fake  [ __ ] human  hey I can comment on the video  bringing the video more relevance  when the [ __ ] do we become not real  anymore yeah  do these companies have a way to figure  it out like they must I don't spot or I  don't know it's a very interesting thing  because at what point is this thing just  AI reviewed and it's like oh this is  great and at what point is it human and  will that make things that are artisanal  way more [ __ ] valuable if it was  something handmade  in 30 years gonna be just so valuable  because nothing is handmade and  everything is automated is real life  conversation gonna be the only thing  that is valuable because everything is  just a canned answer based off of what  was already uploaded it's [ __ ] crazy  it's scary I mean you could run your  business really well with AI you could  do tweets and you can have it to your  phone you can do respond to [ __ ]  texts I mean you could really automate  your life but I feel like it it just  destroys your soul I'm just like well if  you found out I was texting you for a  month and it was all AI would you be  bummed yeah this is so I think so yeah  dude it's crazy bro like it's a crazy  I've been playing with it a lot and just  trying to figure it out the business  emails like if you're a banker or  something and all day long you're just  clients you're like hey I'm interested  in meeting with you this at this I had a  few questions about this blah blah blah  you say Write a response and it answers  the questions for you and you just skim  it through and you're like yep that's  the answer yeah there's another app  called tweet Hunter you look [ __ ] and  this one costs money you load your you  you authorize your Twitter it reads all  your [ __ ] tweets and then it  formulates tweets for you like you that  you can approve and then you can  schedule them to tweet it for you so you  could just sit there one night drunk  high and be like tweet about sports you  know and then like it'll give you 100  tweets that sound like you you can click  which ones you want to [ __ ] go live  when you want them every 20 minutes  every half hour every whatever it's  going to automate people's existence  online which I think I know some people  that have that one already  oh God yeah seriously but how crazy is  it though that some of those people are  like Bots yeah I'm like you're like a  bot like you've become a robot yeah  you've but this is the evolution because  we've we're not most people are asleep  to it you haven't realized that we've  become so [ __ ] automated already it's  like Oh wait we're already automated why  don't we automate this because we  yeah because vice versa in the sense of  that like now there's so many Bots and  things and the internet just pop up pop  in your face you start to become like  influenced by that like art not like art  influence but just uh life influence all  of a sudden you are we're influenced by  uh the [ __ ] that we see in the phone  probably more than we're influenced by  our circle of friends or our family or  our people that we talk to that's  probably gonna most people not me but  but that's gonna change is what I'm  saying is that people I think if people  go this way of automation what they're  saying is I don't  feel like it's going to lose its value  which I think is okay but like if you're  automating things yeah then deep down  you have to know other people are  automating things so what if you're  gauging your worth off of likes then you  come to realize that like this is all  automated  it's all to keep you on this [ __ ]  roller coaster that's a really sad movie  that's a movie I mean that's a sad movie  that we're living in bro I mean I know  but I think I sent you that video who  automated a [ __ ] Instagram  account this I don't know if I did this  dude automated an Instagram account with  this he might have written his own  script to send girls yes good morning  beautiful or good night yeah sweetheart  every [ __ ] night starting like May up  until October they never replied to him  they just got it and then he cut it off  and then the [ __ ] girls made posts  talking about how they re even though  they didn't reply to it they really it  made them feel good  that's where people are and that's  [ __ ] not good yeah and the computers  are gonna take over because people  aren't going to notice the difference  dude they before this [ __ ] even says  [Music]  before this [ __ ] even started like 10 15  years ago there was an experiment where  I was listening to a design podcast like  an engineering one way back in the day  and they were talking about how they had  this fake dog kind of robot thing that  would show love to people and and it was  like a real loving robot it would always  come and check on you it would lay next  to you it would do all these things  and a lot of people like were okay with  that like that was still it felt real to  them they became attached to this fake  dog because that getting that so when  you get attached to a [ __ ] soccer  ball you know  yeah volleyball that's what they say  about Ai and relationships it's going to  change  the face of relationships because  if you are talking to so most people  don't meet the people they date first  right it's all on Tinder or wherever  they're right all right so you're  talking to someone you think is a real  person  it could be AI now well this is my point  so for right now it's just Ai and it's  digital the hardware hasn't caught up  but I'm gonna get to it so AI will be  programmed to talk to you and you know  like when you're dating or whatever you  know sometimes you're afraid of saying  the wrong thing or you say something  that's awkward or you say something  that's a [ __ ] turn off yeah well the  ai's not going to care the AI is going  to be programmed just to make you happy  so you're gonna get a better experience  from this computer that knows what a  relationship is supposed to be program  like for happiness versus your [ __ ]  crazy wife or girlfriend who is a person  and goes through her own emotions and  yeah you have to juggle all of this at  the same time so people I know it's  [ __ ] crazy so then the [ __ ]  Hardware is going to catch up and when  and the simplest way to put it is once  the hardware has a wet tongue it's  [ __ ] over you know because then the  AI and the wet tongue  in a human body once it gets to a point  where you cannot tell the difference  people are gonna gravitate towards a  robot partner because a robot partner  don't talk [ __ ] that's just you just log  on at night you're like hey honey and  you're FaceTiming some fake girl they  got some machine [ __ ] doing whatever  do you like and you're like this is my  like this is easier than having a like I  feel the same love I think that people  will dude because at what point is it  crazy yeah what point Is it artificial  at what point do people give you  artificial love like you're in a  relationship for three years all of a  sudden homegirls just another [ __ ]  person saying the same [ __ ] she just  said on same post same oh my God I'm so  happy and that's the evolution of people  we go through life and experience but at  what point is some of it artificial yeah  you know at some point I mean how many  relations if you had me like man that  whole [ __ ] was kind of fake you know  even me I faked a lot of this [ __ ] it's  automated  exactly a lot of people ought to make  their relationships already well that's  what people need to hear people  especially see people that are unhappily  married to be like yeah we're married  like it's a [ __ ] yes whatever we  figured it out yeah you know whatever  yeah it's basically a business at this  point you know like you know when the  kids are out of the house we'll [ __ ]  yeah yeah I got a hot little thing down  at the gym exactly that's what I mean  that's how people are so it's like  it's wild ain't nobody got time for that  yeah but yeah it's great do the AI  shit's crazy it's so crazy that is so  interesting some of that I didn't even  realize like or think about it that way  yeah I mean responding to emails and  [ __ ] is gonna be like the easiest thing  ever I mean if you in a corporate I mean  I guess it just depends I would never  use it  I feel like for my friends or [ __ ] no  but a quiet email somebody writes you  about a tattoo hey can you do this that  this and this it could know by your  responses you're not going to do this I  do you do these  it's that simple yeah I can do that or  the the generic yeah I can do that  here's the deposit here's that you you  don't have to even look at it you just  copy I mean that's where I think it's  important I don't think I think  copywriting and all that [ __ ] I'm gonna  write Brandy a poem tonight you can do  it right now can we do it right now on  the way home yeah what are you talking  about bro I can do this [ __ ] in two  seconds a poem about missing her from  the airport about missing my wife at the  airport  I got you the copy paste message it to  me I'm gonna send it over all right I  gotta refresh it's like log me out  of what do I send it to her and say I  wrote you a poem right yeah uh actually  me and Dave did this and this [ __ ]  called him out what if you put right a  haiku yeah just relax write a poem about  missing my wife  oh it's so good  I can't okay  so this is a big ass long poem right  yeah and I'm just gonna write make it  here's a poem about missing your wife at  the airport it's typing give me it's  literally going like 100 miles an hour  it's just gonna take just a second dad  said it to me I'll read it out loud  foreign  it's going in bro I mean this is like  we're  spending 16 for you right now Chad he's  about to get your dick look all right  um  I stand alone at the airport Gates  watching planes take off and land  wishing you were here with me my dear  and loving wife I miss your smile your  touch your kiss the way you hold me  tight the way you chase my worries away  and make everything feel right  but now you're far away from me and all  I can do is wait wait for the moment you  return to fill my heart with love and  fate  so I'll stand here at the airport Gates  watching planes take off and land hoping  that you're safe and well and that we'll  be together again  that [ __ ] is fire son certified  I'm just saying I mean you could write a  [ __ ] children's book with this thing  in an after [ __ ] noon you know what  I'm saying like and granted it is  referenced from the internet installing  but everything is everyone walks around  Earth with a quote like there's nothing  new Under the Sun so now that we're  [ __ ] sampling AI they're like well  you're stealing I'm like it's been  happening I know this is why I made the  [ __ ] joke I was like well [ __ ]  thing can't draw a tattoo on so I'm safe  yeah for now but I mean it could tell us  Joe it could give us topics right now I  could say yeah give me five funny  podcast topics boom and we can stay on  for [ __ ] two more hours if we wanted  you know it's yeah  yeah how to go viral it'll be like going  viral is a combination of many things  yeah it's sick it's crazy that was  amazing that poem was amazing  I I can't fire the phone I know wow  that's just a website you don't even  have a GPT that's it yeah  I can't even believe this and the Chad  GPT is what is ingrained and all these  other things so you can start yourself a  business because that's the thing it's  just like with your website business  right like  people don't know about it like yeah  more and more people find out about it  yeah but a lot of people don't your mom  ain't gonna know about it for 40 years  if ever yeah you know yeah other people  aren't going to older business people  but even people 10 years older than us  yo dude even you could create a website  how long before you go on your tangent  about old people you create a website  where people ask questions yeah and they  get answers straight from chat GPT but  they don't know that and you just sell  it if you marketed the website you're  like hey uh yeah God text and then if  you if you just put in your phone text  God and ask a question it'll it'll  answer it I mean how many people will  buy that product  a lot yeah and it's coming you know like  oh it is crazy because even I'm just  saying my little sister today is like  our I'm like oh I gotta I'm going to  Teddy's we're gonna do the podcast she's  like I can never find the podcast I feel  like an old lady now like I can't even  I'm like it's youtube.com Oh it's Teddy  but yeah I'm like you better get your  [ __ ] straight I said because ai's gonna  come take your job in the next few years  and she wrote like lol but like on the  way here that I actually meant that like  I was like yeah and here's a perfect  example but she wouldn't know about this  software most people wouldn't no it'll  take a while you know take a while to  learn how to use it figure it out yeah  all that [ __ ] so  so you're saying it's kind of like an  open source software that you could code  into websites and have it do things  based on yeah it's gonna be everywhere  it's dope what is that noise  I heard that you I heard it move again  I don't know I heard it too it's like  yeah weird  um  yeah dude crazy  sorry I blew your mind now you don't  know where to go yeah I don't know where  to go I I said we have a lot to talk  about so we do let's hear what else you  got so you went to Amsterdam I mean you  started off so that was your personal  trip since we shot since I [ __ ] all over  here  no I don't take your [ __ ] on it I think  it's important for people you know what  I mean I'm right here it's important for  people that oh that's the other thing  one more thing about my trip like I  realized it was you realize you were the  noise in the desert yeah it was so  silent when these people would come  around I'm like hey but like yeah  thinking about it I'm like I am  definitely so [ __ ] loud right  somebody else is like shut the [ __ ] yeah  [ __ ] up [ __ ] up [ __ ] up yeah  oh my God wait now where were we okay  you went back to Amsterdam yeah with  your wife yo so oh another this is great  story too yeah that's what we're here  for buddy I forgot about this so check  in we fly into Amsterdam and I'm like  we're gonna wing it this trip yeah and I  don't know what the [ __ ] is happening  but I'm like we're gonna start in  Amsterdam get some weed chill out some  mushrooms because they have truffles  there have we talked about this before I  think we did with the last one you  talked about the traveling so anyway  they're like mushrooms but different but  we got it so we we got them and we got  weed and then like once you're in  Amsterdam and there's no once you're in  Europe there's really no border  crossings they're like States so like if  you're on a train it's you could bring  your bud with it's not like a bad deal  it's just pretty much anywhere yeah so  so I go to Amsterdam we're like okay  where do we go next we go to Belgium and  there's this town Ghent and Bruges and  they're like medieval towns castles out  of the 1300s 1100s I mean like some  fantasy world [ __ ] dude like Harry  Potter type shows like you're like where  the [ __ ] am I this is insane so we  decide we're gonna micro dose these  truffles I love how everyone all these  stories revolve around you not being  able to handle these drugs but go ahead  well no this so this one brings Brandy  in so she decides she's like well you  know we're in Belgium it's beautiful  it's like a and she's like all right I'm  gonna take we had tea and cake like at  this cute little English bake shop place  and I'm like yo after the cake we'll  have some food in our stomach we'll take  a few of these so Brandi never oh she  had coffee she never really drinks  coffee it gives her anxiety  she had the coffee ate some of these why  did you drink coffee if she knows it  gives you anxiety because they don't  have decaf anywhere in Europe and like  with the cake she'll say I'll just have  a few sips and that's all she had but  either way sometimes that [ __ ] don't  matter she forgot that she did that I  forgot but like wasn't really thinking  of that  these things are hard to dose these  truffles because you never know because  they're so different than mushrooms and  like so I'm like trying to give her just  a little bit well it was way too much so  I mean bro if [ __ ] a little sip of  coffee gets her anxiety when you think  mushrooms are gonna do yeah dude it was  it was bad we're like walking alongside  this beautiful cathedral and she's in  the corner like some drunk person puking  and and like literally freaking out and  I'm trying to like talk her down but I  ate way more and then they're hitting me  and I'm like oh this is bad like this  Jesus [ __ ] Christ bad yeah and then  again same thing like once we got  through that I was fine but I dude I was  like she had to sit on a bench for like  an hour and just like and what just talk  or she's just sit there  just kind of sit there and breathe and  like today and I'm just like you know  and it's like the the peak of me trying  to enjoy myself but instead I'm just  like yeah it's no good yeah no good the  whole thing was brutal and then  um you know again later once you got  through that initial hump she kind of  like came out of it and she got a cup of  uh tomato soup and like a coffee cup  because that's all they had so she's  like walking around Tomatoes soup and  like that'd feel like great be it all  Goofy and like laughing and like came  through it that first hour was brutal we  went from that's really the only story  there we went from there  down to France and they had all these  train strikes going on because of  inflation and dudes aren't getting paid  enough so they're striking I ain't mad  at them for striking but The Whole  World's Gonna crumble bro I don't give a  [ __ ] what you think about nothing this  [ __ ] is not everybody dude you couldn't  go anywhere so then we went to Paris it  was the only train we could get but it  wasn't like a high speed train it was  like literally we went from Belgium like  30 stops throughout France and Belgium  with like layovers and show up in Paris  and then in Paris in the streets there's  protests for this same kind of [ __ ]  there's like military and police and  people [ __ ] whiling out in the  streets I'm like oh this [ __ ] the same  thing for the same thing yeah because it  was also it was something like February  9th there was it was world something big  happened on this day and it's a big day  to do protests now out there it's like  uh it's like right before Veterans Day  out there I don't know so anyway  it was [ __ ] crazy it's all [ __ ] so  funny like today's a really good day for  it I know I know but it's a great day to  fight back yeah let's do it yeah  you know what guys  it's a day no Starbucks we'll fight back  and Brandi didn't love this trip because  she's not good at adapting like quickly  and so why do you guys keep planning  these trips where you do these quick  things we're not anymore okay we're  gonna do a lesson yeah finally because  this would be your Mo we got to Paris  where we were supposed to like go  through Germany and do all this [ __ ] and  we couldn't get on trains so we ended up  going a different direction and it was  like cool it was still all cool but like  brandy would plan these things out have  a list of things she wanted to do be  super [ __ ] psyched and then we get to  the train station I'm like we're not  going there yeah that expectation's a  [ __ ] dog it is interesting  because it is that's what you know and  she gets locked in on this like this is  what it's gonna be I these this place is  beautiful we'll do this that this that  this I found a restaurant and then we  show up and it's like sold out and I  feel like I see her eyes on me like yeah  sold out everything I'm like your fault  bro I'm like I I you know because the  other thing is if you get the train  tickets the day ahead of time  and somehow missed the train or some  like  there's bad sides together so just like  any train ticket in the world you'll get  a train to get ahead and you miss it it  was a reason not to get it ahead  there's another reason to and it seemed  to make sense not to get it ahead you  were at risk like both ways so  I don't know we didn't get it ahead I'd  wait till day of and just see because oh  because of all the strikes it would get  closed down anyway and then you deal  with more paperwork to get the money  back try to get money back from an  airline out there from Brussels Airlines  they wouldn't just put it back on the  card I had to give them my bank routing  number ACH number they had to like  transfer the funds to be on some World  money [ __ ]  it took like three months so I think it  was something like that I was like if  the strikes cancel this [ __ ] then like  I'm gonna be looking for this money for  a [ __ ] year I'm like I'm just not  putting down the money till we're at the  train station well sorry bran yeah well  so we had I I mean I had a blast  definitely wasn't her favorite trip you  know I love the way this is where it is  but uh it's a political pugman over here  no I I wasn't the best trip but uh you  know I still enjoyed it I I did I did  imagine you know there were parts that  where are you going next  um I'm not going anywhere everyone's  always I traveled so much that people  are like where are you going next I'm  not going [ __ ] anywhere my  mother-in-law just had another surgery  on her foot so she has no toes on her  right foot oh my God I know this is  crazy sorry but then she has no toes on  her left foot now she had to search so  she went in to have because basically  this is crazy her toes are like she's  like three toes on the side and they  like keep catching on [ __ ] so they just  like I know so they cut off oh it's  insane they cut off all her toes but  when they went into the surgery she was  like hey can you check on my other foot  that we already did surgery on they  checked on it and they realized that  they was infected as well so they they  had to call us in the middle of the  surgery and be like hey we need to cut  more off of your mom's other foot that  she didn't even know she was going in  for yeah and we were like [ __ ] I mean I  guess do it I was just happy that the  call wasn't like hey we need to cut off  her whole leg or some [ __ ] you know but  what do they do with the toast do you  get them if you don't no I think they  throw them away I don't know because I  think if I want to get buried later I  want the toes back yeah I would just  give them a goal and wear them as  jewelry probably like a necklace ten  toes down yeah but so the point I say  that to say I can't believe people are  always like can you go here like we  can't we can't go anywhere yeah you got  it you got the stuff you got to take  she's like constantly but you can go  inward we can go inward baby yeah every  day yeah it's life life goes in  different directions you know yeah it  does it Ebbs and flows you know there's  times that I travel there's times that I  don't it's also teaching me so much  about life like I have never been more  focused on my health I've never been  more locked in on just and not even like  fighting it on some like oh I'm gonna go  on a diet or I'm gonna oh yeah it's just  like oh no dude if you don't [ __ ]  play this game right you're [ __ ] you  know like you're gonna get to the age of  70 something and you're not gonna be  able to walk that's how I've been too  that's how I've been it's only for that  I'm just like jeez I'm 41 what the [ __ ]  I'm gonna start being healthy what I or  it's over it's over with me you don't  have kids either yeah you know me and  Alex are here yeah and we're helping out  and like it's a godsend for her because  she would have to be in some awful place  and have to sell all the belongings and  all this [ __ ] yeah like that's what's  gonna happen to dudes like us we don't  have kids We're not gonna come take care  of us and if you haven't got your bread  stacked up you're not gonna you're not  gonna have a very great in that's why  you see 80 year olds at [ __ ] Walmart  you know it's just sad it is sad you  know but it's sad it's taught me a lot  it's also taught me one thing I want to  tell everyone which is I've I've wanted  to tweet it but I'm like it's so dark  and out of context but I think it's a  very important thing you need a will  yeah you know like you should have a  [ __ ] will if you don't have a will  you should go get one and another thing  that you should have that Ron did that  was like so important is he had a  [ __ ] database of all of his passwords  for everything yeah you should have that  too because I can't tell you I managed  all this like for the last year I can't  tell you how much this man helped me  yeah before he even was gone yeah and I  was just like dude if we didn't have  this we would be so yeah you know oh  yeah I think that's some everyone should  go do like you should have that because  you're gonna die you know it's gonna  happen it sucks it's sad everyone  everyone left here is gonna be super  bummed but you can make them not [ __ ]  talk [ __ ] about you by leaving some  passwords laying around yeah because  it's a good idea they're gonna talk [ __ ]  about you anyway I hear my mother-in-law  still talk [ __ ] about uh things he  didn't do yeah he never wanted to do  that  it never stops it never stops even after  death I bought a [ __ ] snow blower  though baby yeah with my [ __ ] 40 year  old grown-up [ __ ] it's great I was gonna  Flex it on the Instagram I was gonna  like lean in front of it and be like you  should yeah I got a [ __ ] electric one  nice dropped a g bar on it the ego dude  is sick I haven't used it yet because  I've got snow here because it was sick  coming off the airport it'd be like wow  snow like this is nice it's been brutal  I was not into it because I had to go  out there and my mother-in-law was like  we so last year when things were crazy  we just hired someone to come and do it  because no one had free time yeah and so  this year that guy retired he's like I  don't snow I don't do shoveling anymore  and I was like all right cool whatever  I'll do it yeah going out there thinking  I'm just going to shovel it by hand yeah  and doing that one day after the gym I  was like oh my [ __ ] God I was like  this is brutal yeah and I look down the  street and all these people got snow  blowers and I go inside and my  mother-in-law's like well you know I  used to do it every day before school  before work all right and I'm like  looking I'm like is your back hurt right  now  don't didn't you have to have back  surgery yeah she's like yeah I'm like  yeah I'm going to buy a snow blower yeah  I'll pay for it no problem yeah so uh  yeah but I'm on my dude I just feed  birds and there's still my bird feeders  and throw snow and take care of this  house and it's real grown-up [ __ ] yeah  but it's probably nice too to be in uh  to have that instead of constantly like  I'm still switching up [ __ ] figuring  [ __ ] out what do you mean moving around  a lot you're in the same place yeah for  now but we're getting we're talking  about traveling traveling yeah all that  yeah just a lot of it's got its thing I  can focus I think with yeah all the sh  with the YouTube explosion [ __ ] and then  the helping out Jay [ __ ] and I got and  just everything going on and in the last  year of like being there for Alex and  her mom like  it's so hard to be focused on yourself  yeah and then now because I have this  home base that you know not to be  [ __ ] dark or whatever but like that  me and Alex will stay in once her mom  passes away yeah so we're working  towards our future and that's why we  have to shop here that's why I have  employees like this is where we're at  yeah we're going anywhere so for now  I have to stay here while we build this  [ __ ] Brick by Brick yeah and I might be  in Vegas for a little bit I'm just not  staying in those apartments mostly you  say you're trying to buy a house  probably in Vegas yeah I don't know you  know  I don't know this is too much of a combo  here because I because I don't know  because you don't know where any of this  is going with pricing I have to like I  eventually don't want to keep paying  rent that's for sure like somewhere  along the nine I need like some sort of  retirement and that's owning a house and  hoping that it goes up yeah but what if  the world just [ __ ] crumbles it's  possible but I guess if the world  crumbles and I'm not able to pay rent in  my apartments and they'll be quick to  kick me out it'll be easier to hold on  to your [ __ ] house at least true  we'll all just be headed terminal yeah  like yeah Only the Strong Survive yeah  so if that happens that happens but at  least this way if it doesn't there's a  chance you can't not buy a house or like  make investments because you're like the  world might end yeah yeah yeah I mean  you know I just think I'm like man  because my mother-in-law watches the  news a lot so I just have to like look  at it I have to hear it and I just and  then she gets all [ __ ] supercharged  from it and [ __ ] yeah it's just crazy  all the [ __ ] that gets said like she  came she goes well elon's gonna ruin  Twitter  [ __ ] you're [ __ ] 76 you've never been  on Twitter yeah you know yeah it's  amazing dude Twitter's amazing with the  [ __ ] that's going on it is crazy we  haven't talked about that because he I  think we he had just bought it the last  time you were here yeah I think we  talked about it a little bit now it's  been a real trip it's been a lot of  polarizing people hating on yeah  they're staring at the Rock too long  yeah yeah there's no way they have a  fulfilling life there's no way no the  it's like that's what I'm saying like  people have traded off these numbers and  this like this I feel like human beings  most of us just don't feel heard no  matter what like in your own life and in  your workplace no matter what and even  if you do feel heard like I run [ __ ]  here this is my [ __ ] yeah and I still  sometimes don't feel like I can get my  thoughts out properly you know yeah and  I think that's really hard for people so  when you get online and you find support  for anything yeah no matter how dumb it  is it's not even your own thoughts most  of the time for the way you feel like  came from you if it gives you importance  and that's where I feel like going  inward is really important because you  can go anywhere you know you don't have  to [ __ ] like  it's just like I get the conversation  social media is about being social and  being social is just talking [ __ ]  sometimes and that's cool but like dude  it's every day some of these  [ __ ] are just yeah it's insane  oh by the way I got you this book  sometimes books nice  I don't think you have it uh the Marcus  Aurelius meditations oh no but I love it  yeah thanks the first uh it's a certain  it's the good translation I can't  remember which one it is but  um nice  uh it's good the first introduction is  about the history of him which is old oh  yes all this like [ __ ] Socrates there  and [ __ ] but uh  the the translation or from his books  but the intro on him is interesting so  you know who you're who who's talking  but yeah still [ __ ] super ill [ __ ] I  just looked down at the chat and someone  said take a Japan trip I'm not going  anywhere and I'm not going to Japan yeah  I'm not going to a [ __ ] country  that shut the [ __ ] are these that's what  I'm saying man I'm not sucking the dick  of the [ __ ] fantasy life anymore I'm  not gonna pretend like traveling to this  place and like oh it's so different and  oh look at the culture and ah it's all a  game dog these countries just play chess  with our [ __ ] livelihood I'm not  getting back in line to [ __ ] uh  contribute to their [ __ ] GDP I'm not  doing it I'm not [ __ ] gonna get back  out there and be a tourist yeah  [ __ ] Japan didn't like white  people before all right let's just get  it out the [ __ ] away Japan didn't like  white people before you go to places  that say no foreigners on the door I  know the left here mine would explode if  they [ __ ] saw it it happens I know  you never left the [ __ ] country but  you don't know [ __ ] but I'm here to tell  you they don't like you you [ __ ] pale  face [ __ ] you blew up half the [ __ ]  goddamn country so now they they're  [ __ ] propaganda this whole time  during the [ __ ] America dumb era of  the last two three years has been  watching us argue about [ __ ] [ __ ]  acting like [ __ ] Hillbillies coughing  each other's faces arguing arguing  arguing  I mean can you [ __ ] imagine the  propaganda one of the warnings on the  train in the train in Japan is a  suspicious Act is basically being a  foreigner that's one of the things if  you see something say something there is  like foreigner like that's what it is so  it's our you're not welcome so for the  last two or three years they've been on  [ __ ] straight up lockdown their  economy has been [ __ ] crashed they've  been told that the [ __ ] crackers are  out here in America [ __ ] being  ridiculous they don't give up we don't  give a [ __ ] like they do they're so  [ __ ] ingrained in the community and  it's all for all for one out there we're  all like yeah [ __ ] you I'm a cough in  your face and [ __ ] on your grandma and  now everybody wants to go back oh yeah  let's just go travel they've been  [ __ ] told we've been spreading this  virus all around now let's go to their  sushi restaurant no I'm not going [ __ ]  that that's not happening it's over for  me in Japan for at least [ __ ] three  years probably five yeah if it's still  there because I'm not [ __ ] I'm not a  political guy but I don't think that  we're not going to war I don't think  that this China Taiwan is not happening  if we go to war with all these things  then travel's done for us I think it's  over with bro but I'm not playing this  game like [ __ ] all this [ __ ] I do love  traveling but you're still in Target  I see what you're saying I'm not trying  to talk better than anybody I'm just  saying that I see I did a lot of  traveling yeah I see it for what it is  those fancy [ __ ] hotels are just  sheetrocking paint I get it  cable it's the same [ __ ] convenience  it's all the same if I can't find that  happiness right here anywhere put me on  a cell put me in hell if I can't find  that on my own then I'm not powerful I  need that power no matter what's going  on so [ __ ] traveling [ __ ] Japan [ __ ]  these [ __ ] countries that's how I  feel damn I've been drinking moonshine  this whole time  [Laughter]  I don't even know what to say now yeah  sorry  um I don't think they don't want us  traveling though someone said that kind  of the whole point they don't want to  travel they want us traveling Japan's  [ __ ] out of money their [ __ ] money  comes from Taurus tourism is a big part  of it for sure and now you got this  whole China [ __ ] going on where China  look at your face I don't even know  what's going on well China has had these  crazy coveted lockdowns but now they're  getting like yeah but now they're  getting super infected with some other  [ __ ] now they're not trying to let  people in the country from China yeah  and that's causing all kinds of problems  the whole thing seems like a [ __ ]  weird ass  dystopian sci-fi novel that people are  just going along with because  because I and no one cares like that's  just what happens like people die and  then it's it's a [ __ ] five minute  thing for the internet and then really  people just going away from no one cares  even if a bomb hit [ __ ] Texas right  now and Austin was wiped off the map the  only [ __ ] thing that's gonna change  is there's gonna be a bunch of tweets  about it for a few days until another  Iron Man movie comes out and that's the  [ __ ] reality so we're not connected  to anything true I mean insane with  death like you see somebody and  everybody you know you celebrated for a  day or two and then that's it that's it  that's all it's all it's I mean the  24-hour news cycle has infected our  brains like we are infected by what's  going no one really cares it's  impossible to care it's impossible it is  impossible I guess in that sense and  like I mean the people really close May  care but like yeah like the internet  like people even people that you're  pretty close to like people from you  know there's kids I went to high school  with that I'm pretty close with if I  heard they died it would be devastating  in the moment and the next day would  kind of sucking need to be bummed out in  the next day and then you yeah I mean  not my good friend but this kid that I  worked with in DC yeah passed away in  the sixth yeah randomly yeah just from  some crazy infection you know and I saw  it I was like damn but and it reminds  you that they're like it really comes  back to your ego because you really guys  mentality yeah yeah so I but I just be  like damn crazy but yeah like he's gone  and then his life and the people next to  him are affected by it yeah and that's  it and then yeah it doesn't matter to  anybody else it's just like the  situation that we've been going through  if you see the new quavo video  for takeoff I have it but I mean just  like that that video is so different the  song is it's a good song It's a good  Memorial song it's the best thing I  think that quavo's ever done it's so  unfortunate that it has to come out  through this you know yeah sometimes art  is that way you know where the most  awful [ __ ] creates the best  but you can tell by looking at that  [ __ ] video  that that man has changed and part of  that video is even about how he's not  going to be the same yeah because when  the [ __ ] [ __ ] hits the fan and when  real [ __ ] happens and you watch your  [ __ ] homie drop  it's not any more about any of the other  [ __ ] it's true all the [ __ ] is gone  it's done it's over with and that's true  I respect him so much for [ __ ] and I  at first I was like man I can't really  put this out because  it's kind of like weird but this is  probably the only way this man knows how  even how to heal about it and I'm glad  that he showed that this is like  completely washed the varnish of the  [ __ ] Migos bling and the [ __ ] off  yeah at least yeah for now and who knows  how long but it it doesn't matter  anymore yes you know everybody else is  moving on because people listen to that  song and then they go next to bad and  boujee and they're just back to their  life yeah it certainly affects you it's  true wow  this has been a deep one I like it yeah  we get deep yeah we get deep out here  yeah is that what you do it has been I  uh  we got plenty of time man it's only 11  30. no I know I'm just joking one  o'clock yeah oh [ __ ] we have as much  time as you want I mean you're flying  home tonight I have to what time do I  have to really leave here what time is  your flight the flight is at I gotta  look  I think it's at like seven yeah  that cuevo sacrifice take off I don't  believe in any of that [ __ ] I just  don't until I can have proof about  anything I can't that's what I'm saying  man like everything with the [ __ ]  fouchies and the and the the politics  and then everyone's got some narrative  and no one knows the details it doesn't  matter the bottom line is I mean do we  really think there's human sacrifices  going on no I don't but even if there  was and that's how he died he's still  dead yeah so it's like yeah even if he  had to sacrifice him it would [ __ ]  completely change if you were like in  the Illuminati and they were like hey  you gotta sacrifice your brother and  you're like you still be [ __ ] up over  it yeah I had to sacrifice my brother  for these chains [ __ ] of her number one  hit I mean if that's the way it works  that's dark and that's [ __ ] I don't  know if I'm that deep down that rabbit  hole that kind of sounds like a rabbit  ultimate yeah and I mean I don't know  there's always been that weird thing  people like in the industry like you've  gotta you know it's Illuminati and  people sign their souls to the devil to  make music and it's like I wonder if  it's unofficial or official  oh a lot of bands I not one of them  satanic  it's  so I mean I'm not talking about them  anymore I'm not trying to make this  [ __ ] connection I'm just saying  because I'm not going to disrespect  someone's life like that or anything but  I mean you're talking about reaping what  you sow yeah and there is some truth to  that I'm not going to act like the Migos  don't drop music about shooting people  or not so there is some truth to that  and you can't just glaze over it so in  some ways some people can say if you  create things that that feed the evil  spirits or the evil energy that you're  you're selling your soul to the devil  but dude where do you draw the line on  that yeah I mean the Clorox that you use  to [ __ ] wash your [ __ ] I mean like  where what what corner of this world is  not evil yeah and then again back to the  symptom like the why the [ __ ] do people  are people drawn to it why do you buy it  why do you buy into it why do you live  it why do you when you hear a rap song  do you get transformed and pretend like  it's your life what's the [ __ ] deeper  issue here because it's not the fact  that it exists a lot of [ __ ] exists  and no one cares pumped it's marketed to  you and you buy a hookah line of [ __ ]  sneaker and that's how it works just  like how you had to respond to Andrew  Tate just how you had to let everyone  know that you don't agree with beating  women no [ __ ] [ __ ] yeah you know yeah  like you don't need to remind people  every day of your moral [ __ ] angel on  top of your [ __ ] self Christmas tree  bro we know like we're all pretty decent  and when someone's not like ah [ __ ] but  that [ __ ] gets attention yeah 100 I mean  if I tattoo my forehead and drop the  blog you don't think it's gonna do  numbers I mean it is like it's just yeah  yeah this is what it is we need to be  better we gotta stop to stop paying  attention to [ __ ] this goes back to  my trip with the you know as a whole  civilization Society everything you hope  that people get better because if not  this is it's over it's over and the ai's  already better listen to how that thing  [ __ ] wrote that poem yeah well and  there's no uh like people are having  less kids yeah you know like everybody  thinks it's over populated but it's not  no it's not because you go to empty  places the world you're like there's a  lot of space out well because now all  the elderly it's like there's old people  but there's no one to take care of the  old people like there's one generation  skit like me and Alex taking care of her  mom is like the last generation of that  for the most part like that's just over  with yeah most people aren't having kids  like that  it's like idiocracy the people that are  having the most kids the dumbest I mean  like dude that movie's still just yeah  it's crazy I mean with the ads with the  [ __ ] in your face with politics and it's  [ __ ] good enough chat gbt just gonna  be like welcome across you yeah go [ __ ]  yourself we're just gonna be right there  dude everything is just made up now what  do you think is gonna happen with the  presidential election what do you think  is coming you think Trump's gonna run I  don't you know I can't tell but from the  little headlines and things that seem to  come out you can tell the media is just  making it sound like no one gives a [ __ ]  about him but dude I mean let's be real  when he first ran the first time  everybody was like come on oh yeah dude  I thought it was a joke so who knows I  have no idea who and what I really have  fallen  out of it Biden I see again like I don't  want to see his tweets because it's just  the most [ __ ] tweets but that's just  probably Chad GPT I mean that [ __ ]  sounds like I mean any of those  institutions for sure aren't going to be  using like  real [ __ ] dude he just tells these  stats every day and talks about how it's  the greatest thing ever and I'm just  like I don't even want to see this  because I don't believe it because I  still have uh you know I don't have  health insurance and I'm just paying off  these college loans and both these  things I was promised yeah yeah  I got you I don't blame me I didn't vote  sticker over I pulled one out of the  archive for you  yeah there it is yeah  I got so much help for that [ __ ]  stuff I think it's [ __ ] hilarious I  know I mean I can't put it on I mean now  it's even proved even further it's  proved even further like I didn't vote  for either side of this [ __ ] and y'all  are so [ __ ] yeah y'all are so dead  set on hating Trump for things that  didn't have anything to do with real  politics for the most part that you  [ __ ] ran over the other side and that  and then and cheered for it and like  clamored to it we just used the  government now it's only one side that's  the thing I don't care bring the hate  Bag Man yeah stop [ __ ] not right  across the board yeah stop [ __ ]  acting like you need to sit with them  bro yeah you're a [ __ ] idiot it does  it's like to prove you don't like one  you have to kind of show that you like  the other and it's like and then you  stoop down to stupidity to try to prove  your point and like it's like I love  when someone says something like that's  not he never said that like what sounds  like something he would say and then you  stoop down to stupidity levels to try to  to win and then everyone's dumb no one  can take either side seriously it's  ridiculous it's pretty but what do you  do just make I guess we just make fun of  it all I mean that's what I've been  doing just coming out and just talking  [ __ ] about everything what's scary is is  like there's no way to reverse this this  is like a ball that's rolling so fast it  has to fall apart all the Legacy [ __ ]  has to fall apart and it has to be  rebuilt in a different way I mean that's  why you have media companies falling I  mean media is done big media like CNN  and all this [ __ ] like it's getting so  much worse and then it's getting exposed  more and more and more as there's other  ways of media and you know I think  that's part of the battle with Elon I  think that's part of the battle with  anybody  with any of these things because now  they're they're the same I mean Twitter  is is as big as any media channel not  dead not that it's you know and and you  that's why you want to believe that it's  fair because if it's fair and somehow AI  or technology or the right system keeps  it fair then you're like okay well at  least we're getting both views but again  if a human is running it it's only so  fair I trustee like I like a lot of what  Elon says but people make bad decisions  people are you know  I don't know what is Twitter like what  decision needs to be made I don't  understand like well right they're like  elon's whole thing was that he was he  exposing Twitter that they're hiding  things and they're taking one side they  say he bought a crime scene that's what  the quote I like the best is like he  bought a crime scene and now he's able  to like show everybody what happened  over the last few years yeah which is  true but all I'm saying is you know  anything this powerful no matter who  takes it over at some point they can but  why does it have to be why can't it just  be an open thing it should be open but  because like everything in our world  it's like free speech is an open thing  but but no one has power and like if  we're all in a room there's 20 of us in  a room no one has power like someone  leads the conversation but it's just a  dialogue so I don't understand the  company has because we existed without  Twitter for [ __ ] hundreds of years  well I agree I'm not saying we need  Twitter but I'm saying the people that  are so caught in that world  it serves you like you said it serves  you that your side is right like you  walk away feeling that like there's no  way to reverse that aspect of it I guess  is what I'm saying there's no way to  make everyone feel like we don't have to  have a side you know what I mean like  there's no way you're never going to  educate people to be to become disarmed  yeah yeah because they feel like they  have to fight for some because if they  disarm then the other people well and  there's probably some truth to that if  everyone disarmed and became  [ __ ] whatever the passive then they  would do whatever they want so because  there's greedy people because it still  feels like they do it at some point it  does like they still do but I'll say  that that's kind of what I meant is no  matter who's in charge somebody's gonna  do whatever they want no matter how good  a certain amount it only takes one bad  person or one with some sort of  you know people are just they they're  greedy they're out for that yeah but  what you're talking about is people  you're saying a bad person that what  you're talking about is people getting  misinformed like the only way to  weaponize this thing is to misinform  people yes or sway the way that the  information that again comes down to  people having to just do doing more  research yeah do a diligence not having  a [ __ ] opinion about it which is  probably how you save the most time  yeah but no you're right though the the  important part is if you don't have to  have an opinion but that's what I'm  saying is that nobody seems to get that  nobody's yeah we're too far in I think I  think getting locked into our homes just  [ __ ] crazy there's nothing else to  talk about because of the [ __ ] it did  today you go to somebody's house and  yeah your conversations become like what  do you think of this well I think this  well really well you just means this  yeah yeah for sure it's like why is that  the convo why are we even talking about  that I don't know because talking about  other stuff that's deeper or realer or  talking about art or talking about  it's life well none of it matters but  like what part of it's fulfilling I  guess because I get to the point where  I'm like I don't really want to talk  about [ __ ] with most people like I like  [ __ ] with you yeah because we talk  about a lot of the same stuff but then I  never like leave those conversations  like man we got a lot done we just kind  of vent to each other and make jokes  yeah which I guess is a good like  release I just don't know why people  yeah I don't know I mean it's like to  segue and talk about it the I don't know  the guy's name unfortunately the  football player who went in the cardiac  arrest yeah and I'm not a sports guy but  the fact that that turns into a [ __ ]  whole other conversation about football  being banned and vaccines about football  being banned uh it got racial I saw  racial things about it about black  people if football being treated a  different way about the vaccine that it  um it's actually giving more heart  attacks to athletes about I mean you  take one guy who almost lost his life  and it becomes a political [ __ ] stand  from every group and everything to get  behind what yeah because everyone will  use anything that's it that's the note  you use whatever is trending to prove  your point I'm gonna prove my point one  more time and I'm gonna show it here oh  this happened today let me show you how  this also proves my point but what  you're really saying is don't forget  about me yeah you know yeah without  actually doing anything yeah because you  don't have to act actually doing it and  it's like easier even to like on  Instagram to take a reel and duet  something and quick you don't have to  put any effort in than it is to do this  I mean you took a [ __ ] flight here  yeah you know what I'm saying like yeah  it costs us money to do this you know so  it's like  yeah there's it's all going away it's  all gonna go away it's all gonna be  automatic and people are gonna like it  because just like top songs yeah they  figured out the BPM they figured out  which 15 Riders to get on it yeah and  they figured out how to make your brain  work and that's why songs go number one  you know like this [ __ ] Western  that works here arguing about Avatar  I've never seen Avatar one I missed I  missed the boat I think it's too late to  go back he is obsessed with Avatar and  he went to see Avatar too and he's just  like I mean he's 19. you know God God  bless him you know but like he's like oh  it's so [ __ ] good and all I do is  talk [ __ ] to him all day long you know  but the other day I was like I don't  think Avatar is doing too good in the  box office you know I'm just trolling  them and then he stands up all Gully  he's like Avatar earning blah blah blah  it takes out number eight spot for top  earning movie in the world Top Gun is  taken out of the spot and then I was  like hold on Weston and I went and  looked up the top 10 movies or top 30  really grossing movies  [ __ ] all the way down first off  Avatar's number one so you expect number  two to at least be on the top ten yeah  it's basically Avatar Iron Man  Spider-Man yeah Avengers in-game boom  boom it's all and what it beat out was  fast and the furious seven so I'm like  dude this like nothing before  2009 basically we don't know when Avatar  came out is on this list what does that  tell you about like greatest of all time  lists or  it's such a flash dude yeah it's such a  flash in the pan of [ __ ] [ __ ] I'm  like and none of those movies are good  yeah not a single movie on there is good  they're entertaining or whatever but  they're not good movies they're not  gonna change your life like real art  would like how Cinemas started not to  sound like a complete [ __ ]  hoo-ha I'm just saying yeah like it it  doesn't do anything for you it's it's  action and you're like oh your brain's  firing like you're playing fortnite but  yeah but it's a magical world it's  Escape it's it's you know it's heroism  because it doesn't exist because if you  go outside it's [ __ ] bad yeah  that's what it is yeah so I get it but  you can't be [ __ ] preaching to me  that that [ __ ] is the best it's not the  best because a bunch of [ __ ] [ __ ]  went to go see it though I don't I've  never seen it I've seen the first one I  don't recall it being a favorite it  wasn't bad it was just it was an action  movie and I think at the time again like  the effects and [ __ ] were a huge deal  well that's what most of that is for  most people who like it say to you and  he's a [ __ ] total nerd I mean he's  like are the effects any better than any  other like I feel like everything is at  such a high level of effects now like  what is the effects better than the  Avengers is the question yeah because I  mean in the 90s well this is part of the  Escape though I think do I but will it  get any better for me  I'm sure they're planning what's the  next is your 3D virtual are you in the  movie yeah yeah for sure but you're  forgetting where we came from it's like  Mario Brothers Nintendo okay these  Graphics or whatever this is still fun  oh they're getting better they're  getting better they're getting better  they're getting better now when I play  Call of Duty it's like a real [ __ ]  War That's crazy dude I play FIFA soccer  and it I mean and then I watched soccer  the other day like just a little bit and  I'm like  it is no different like I don't know  anything about soccer and how they  should move on the field but it sure  looks like my [ __ ] video game the way  that it's gonna get better but do I need  anything further  because what you're talking about  further is convincing me it is Rio which  is what I'm talking about getting your  dick sucked by a robot yeah so that's  what we're that's what I'm saying like  yeah that is what it is it's Escapist  you're gonna replace yourself that it's  yeah you're gonna replace I mean often  everything that you value by doing that  if you don't I'm not saying I I agree or  not yeah General no but it is it is uh  it is weird it's it's really weird yeah  we're gonna [ __ ] robots  not me you're gonna let it [ __ ] you no  no gay if you have sex with a robot  and it's male  it's a good question I don't know yeah I  mean like what what's gonna happen there  I wonder what pronouns the robots are  gonna go by or what if just robots  people that [ __ ] robots are gonna have a  reputation will they lie will you not be  able to know if they're yeah it's like a  prostitute like are you [ __ ] robust  no I'm not [ __ ] I've never [ __ ] a  robot what are you talking about no no  no no I'm saying what if the like what  if you can't tell if it's a robot or a  robot Sly and you don't know I don't  know yeah that'd be wild you're just  getting them blowy and then all of a  sudden a [ __ ] uh a [ __ ] uh a SIM  card flies out every [ __ ] neck you're  like  [ __ ] was that oh nothing baby yeah oh  [ __ ] look up  I'm just saying I just wonder these  things that's a good thought I don't  know you have a future  it's crazy I feel like it's coming I  wonder how much of it in our lifetime  we'll get to see but when I think you  probably see a lot of it because soon  enough our body parts are going to  become part Robotic yeah I mean  neuralink is coming yeah or you know  anything about it I know that it's like  you know taking that chat GPT [ __ ] and  put it into your [ __ ] brain yeah so  that's over with someone's like how do  you change a carburetor  you're done it's over with carburetor is  [ __ ] changed yeah like that yeah that  is going you're gonna see like in The  Matrix where they're like oh how do we  fly a helicopter he's like hold on I'll  upload and then yes yeah sure it's  coming like that's happening  we'll probably be in our 70s but who  knows at that point you might be able to  like hey dude we put a little robot hard  in you you're good I mean most people  die from heart [ __ ] so it's like yes  they can just start replacing Hearts  yeah no dude it is crazy it's what you  think about I mean you even think about  for my grandma's time like how long  she's been here like I mean she's 80  something like dude she was there when  they barely had telephones like you had  to [ __ ] dial up the thing and [ __ ]  and like and now now dudes are  FaceTiming the frost like yeah it's a  fast transition that we've made here  trying to find something real quick  and it's only going to get faster  because once the AI is doing all the  thinking look at it then  it is really crazy yeah we've gone on  some real futuristic [ __ ] today dog  yeah I mean I think so that's how you  got to be yeah what else you got now  I don't know I felt like I had talked  about it and talking about Greta  Thornburg I still hate Greta Thornburg  I hate the whole principle of any of it  I hate that she's a pawn she's like a  girl on the Spectrum whose parents use  her to fight on the internet and become  some sort of hero or not hero I don't  think that's good for somebody like even  I think it's good for adults to say that  she should run they're like she should  run our entire programs like what the  [ __ ] is wrong with people I just think  it's weird I don't think somebody like  even if it's good even if in her head  she thinks she's doing all this great  stuff and fighting the good fighter [ __ ]  I still think like I don't know there's  some theories that climate change isn't  even like the climate change is real but  it's normal yeah we've experienced this  before and then we're actually trending  lower in heat index than in Prior years  but people only think of scale people  only think of their era yeah or their  grandparents that's why people say  scenes things like Michael Jordan's the  greatest of all time it's like [ __ ]  you've been here for [ __ ] two seconds  shut the [ __ ] up Michael Jordan is [ __ ]  in the grand scheme of things man Fool's  gonna be dust too you know what I'm  saying I just think yeah but I'm saying  whatever it is I don't even I don't even  people pick one person someone asked if  we heard about Brazil but I looked it up  the Brazil the Brazilians are invading  Congress in Mass  in their own Congress down there huh  yeah they didn't come here on a trip  that would have been wild if it was like  another Insurrection but from Brazil  yeah yeah well uh yeah [ __ ] part two  Brazil's huge  I've never been no I've never been  either but like when you look at it on a  map you drag South America on top of  North America it's like the size of  [ __ ] almost like most of North  America like that's how big oh yeah it  is Big yep I remember it on a map now  you're saying it yeah like you don't  realize it's huge  uh if anybody wants us to talk about  anything we can or we could ask chat GPT  for another oh you want to hear yeah  let's see let's see  um what to talk about on uh what kind of  podcasts what do we say like we just be  like what is a funny  podcast topic okay I'll take it  damn dog you ready for this yeah should  we do whatever it says  let's see I don't know it depends I  don't know how deep this is gonna bring  us all right well it's gonna give me two  okay wait now it's giving me three  that could be a hundred  reading a funny classified ad and  creating a fictitious background for the  people who wrote them  okay which would be kind of funny I mean  I don't really want to do it but taking  your podcast on a journey and reporting  of your travels dog  look at you bro professional is it  listening to us too making a Time  specific podcast for the night time or  morning  interviewing interesting people on  public buses no that's not what we want  um just here you can just be like give  me a good discussion topic or a an  argument sounds good  thought  provoking  topics yeah I've been going so uh  actually dude I got a [ __ ] pee so bad  can you carry this for a second yeah I  could carry it all right I'm gonna have  to uh do whatever you got I'm gonna ask  the chat GPT bro I'm just gonna talk to  chat GPT I think but um  well we'll catch up on the history of me  I can't see the the questions so I can't  really answer anything but uh  I'm interested to see what the next  topic is as usual I thought there'd be  a lot more to talk about  really my trip to the desert was a  pretty wild one I do still enjoy  traveling  I see  Teddy saying but I do maybe it's an  Escape for me still somewhat you know  seeing different places and they do feel  different and I see how he can feel that  now from not traveling which is great I  wish I could because  I don't know because I love traveling  but uh  that being said I'm getting tattooed  here today which and then flying back in  about leaving here in about three and a  half hours so uh  we have maybe we'll get some lunch and  then do that  it's basically where we're at  um  trying to think what other thoughts I  have here  let's go into  okay well  yeah we're going to talk about the um  impermanence of life and how everything  changes oh here's Teddy all right we're  back let's see what Chachi PT has to say  all right but first I was gonna say it's  actually funny because it's the first  the first topic is personal growth and  self-improvement we have hit all yeah we  are AI yeah um it's like we did this  before but yeah I was gonna say the last  podcast I bought the Fat Bike yep  um I haven't ridden it no at all no dude  I'm so crazy I went through the whole  thing I bought all this winter gear yeah  I bought that by it's like all right  might get out there yeah and then it  snowed once and I was like [ __ ] this  it's so cold yeah the snow gets hard as  [ __ ] immediately and you're like oh this  is terrifying it's like ice yeah you  have to basically wait for a nice day  where there's still snow and I don't  have time for it right now anyway so I  also just real like the last time I was  like  I'm not gonna make I'm not gonna let  myself go to the gym you know like I  always overdo it I start on like a  health thing and then I do everything at  once and in a way I've done what I plan  to do and I've tapered it yeah it's  funny because literally as soon as that  podcast is over I was like  I gotta go start lifting weights man  like The Jock just always comes out of  me so yeah I ended up going to my gym  which is amazing my gym is the [ __ ]  sickest gym ever there's no one there  nice oh god dude it's ill it's like  called Gym number five in Boulder nice  and uh I signed up for it right when we  got here and then I just didn't  everything was crazy so I didn't have  time and uh at first when I got I was  like man they don't really have a lot of  uh the regular equipment you see and you  know coming from like the gym in Vegas  where yeah every crazy thing and so they  don't have a lot of that stuff and then  as I started working out there more and  more I was like do they have so much  better [ __ ] it's like No Nonsense [ __ ]  it's like yeah real training and then  all the people who work out they're like  real deal it's like a real man's man's  gym there's only men but it's just you  feel like you're [ __ ] training you  know you don't feel like you're just  showing up there or that you're just  with a bunch of [ __ ] turds you know  like everyone there is like nice and  they're there to [ __ ] pay attention  like they're training like they're not  like me and the main trainer one of the  main dudes there who were becoming  acquaintances or whatever but we didn't  talk for the first two months probably  yeah you know and then yeah then  suddenly it's like hey what's up you  know yeah it's like it's been great I've  been having that stuff so much fun there  but I haven't ride my bike at all but my  plan is just like  I've been paying attention I've been  tracking my [ __ ] calories and eating  a lot of protein  um and carbs or whatever yes I know what  I'm eating so that I know and I'm just  gonna and lifting and losing weight  slowly but uh when the [ __ ] that way  when it does get nice out I'll just be  stronger for the bike yeah and then when  I'm on the bike and in the gym then  you'll see yeah then you'll see the real  yeah the real transform but dude it's  been great I've been I've been trying to  get up at four nice on some Jocko [ __ ]  yeah you know Jocko yeah yeah so the  [ __ ] chocolate I think that's his  name yeah yeah but uh  I'm trying to give it four and get to  the gym at like 4 30 and [ __ ] well  that's a good time too that's why it  also is official because only real real  yeah people are before 30. my gym dude  you can't but literally you can't walk  through it's like a [ __ ] hangout it's  like there's a million people dude you  go to the treadmills and there's like  six open out of 50. you know what I mean  like there's like people I can't do it  every machine you can't get in your mind  you can't get the machine that you want  or the even like the bench press you go  over to the bench press there's six of  them they're always taken you have to  like literally get in line and then you  gotta get on something else and I'm like  that's not where I wanted to start today  like you can't just come in and grab a  bench like yeah that's why he's got to  beat everybody there Alex thinks I'm  insane and like I did it for like two  days and the next day I crashed so I'm  still trying to work up to like making  it my thing but because now I get up at  six so you gotta change I've been doing  six for a long time so now it's two  [ __ ] hours earlier but yeah it's hard  but it's been great uh two hours is a  big difference I get up at five or six  but each three or four is different but  I really I mean I just think for people  like resistance training is [ __ ]  great like lifting weights I don't know  why in my life I ever get to a point  where I get bummed on it yeah because  every time I'm in in it I'm like why do  I do this to myself everybody is I'm  such a nicer person a better person like  I feel better like yeah food tastes  better like all of it is better and I  still  sometimes [ __ ] like dude I when we  got here and all this [ __ ] happened here  I had to put on a bunch of weight like I  must have gotten like over 300 pounds it  must have been like clicking like dude I  had to have I had to have been around  320 when I opened the shop because I was  just like eating because everybody's  bringing all this [ __ ] to the house when  I got on the bike it was hard as [ __ ] at  first so I had to like drop a couple of  pounds before I even felt comfortable  going into the gym that's it yeah I  [ __ ] it just gets away from me really  quickly oh it does dude I [ __ ] you  know and a lot of it was like water  weight and I lost it quick again but  like I was doing really good and then  like Christmas I was off for  five days just you know the other Brandy  came we ate out every night my mom sent  cookies were eating desserts we're  eating ice cream dude but my secret is  this bro and this is the problem and  this is what I've learned and this you  don't need to do this like like up and  down well yeah like you don't need to do  this  if you just [ __ ] paid attention to  how many calories you eat every day well  that's what I mean you wouldn't know it  but when your friend comes in town and  you fill those calories with cookies and  [ __ ] or whatever as long as you  still don't go over that it doesn't  matter and that's what tortured me for  years like for years I'd be like I have  to eat this certain way I have to do  this certain thing or I don't even  mentally I don't feel right or whatever  and then I realized dude like I was  dropping pounds on [ __ ] Pizza yeah  and burgers and whatever I was just  eating underneath 2 700 [ __ ] calories  as long as I got my protein at 250 and I  got 2 700 calories and I didn't bring my  fat over 100 120 grams a day I was  [ __ ] dropping weight yeah the problem  is I couldn't control myself those  Christmas cookies there's like enough  that should last you two weeks because  you've been [ __ ] restricting yourself  and if you stop [ __ ] restricting  yourself the rest of the time it won't  matter it'll no longer have value  because you're like a dog just like it  dude I've learned this myself it but  that's I'm not just talking to you  you're talking like this is what happens  because I used to think I couldn't be as  like dude I can't be around Alex yeah  Alex eats nothing but [ __ ] Golden  Grahams and Oreos  I'm like [ __ ] but now that I like I know  exactly what I'm eating and I know it  all I don't even I'm yeah sure if I see  Oreo and I'm like I want it cool I just  track it and I know it and it's just  been great I just think everyone out  there should just have the freedom like  there's no such thing as a diet food  yeah you just need to make sure you hit  your [ __ ] numbers that's really good  I can move your body yeah well once you  start moving too and you start feeling  better then you kind of do eat less junk  just naturally because it makes you  tired like if I can hit those numbers  you couldn't hit the protein you need to  recover from a heavy workout no not if  you switch it off with a slice of  chocolate cake and then the problem is  like you start to notice if you're not  eating that much sugar and you [ __ ]  shove yourself full of it you like crash  after the next day you have like a  little headache or you feel like you're  like this is weird like I feel that you  don't want my body you don't want yeah  you take a bite of it yeah but which is  where I'm but before when I was like a  crazy bodybuilder or whatever yeah super  [ __ ] tiny with the muscle  I would have like the idea of even a  bite of cake going in my mouth would  have been deviation from the [ __ ]  plan yeah and I wouldn't do it because  one deviation meant the whole thing was  thrown out and that is just like an  awful way to live your [ __ ] life and  another piece of advice that I have is  for all these [ __ ] kids out here is  you do not need to be on steroids like  the amount of steroid especially YouTube  now is blowing up with kids there's the  trend twins who I like I think these  dudes are entertaining as [ __ ] if you  haven't seen the trend twins but uh  people really need to chill like even  the kid West in here is like man I'm 25  I might get on a cycle and I'm like it's  infecting their brains like you don't  need that [ __ ] yeah just get your body  to where it'll go naturally yeah and  then [ __ ] chill you know because it  ain't gonna No One's Gonna care you know  what I'm saying like yeah you're chasing  some [ __ ] and you're and you're yeah  what are you attracting people that  really do care and that's the number one  thing they care about that maybe that's  not the most important people it's other  dudes it's other dudes another dudes are  going to come up to you it's just like  Jordan's yeah you're not flexing for  women women don't care yeah you know I  have to have some [ __ ] I'm probably  gonna have like surgery on my bottom gum  here soon and I was telling Alex like I  think I'm gonna have to [ __ ] get this  [ __ ] fixed it's starting to like get  really bad and then uh [ __ ] shoot I  was like you know sorry you know  hopefully I don't [ __ ] have to like  lose a tooth or some [ __ ] and she's like  wow  my first boyfriend that broke up with me  had a chipped tooth and it was so hot  and I was like see I don't even [ __ ]  care yeah I'm like we were worried about  it the same third so it's pretty funny  um yeah yeah there's someone said they  cry when they heard the rock wasn't  natural  you know the rock won't admit he's on  steroids really yeah he tells people  he's never that he touched it once  didn't like it and that he's achieved  his physique through that's hard  training that's anybody that kind of  sizes this one is hard to believe I mean  yeah yeah for sure I mean you heard  about the liver King yeah yeah yeah I  think we talked about it last time yeah  we got caught so now it's like he got  caught he's doing twenty thousand  dollars worth of stereo yeah and now all  of his supplements and everything that  he sells is yeah well now he's getting  sued for like 100 million dollars yeah  it's insane it's [ __ ] it's not that  that's right either I mean it all sucks  this [ __ ] is [ __ ] crazy I know but uh  chat EPT like literally bro we are Bots  hold on  let's hit it all then we'll just take  some questions yeah I think they're  gonna get some lunch  okay so here it goes personal growth and  self-approvement check the nature of  reality in existence I mean dog that's  what we were talking about ethics and  morality yeah  this is the main podcast ever the  meaning and purpose of life yeah we have  done all this political and social  issues yeah technology and its impact on  society wow environmental concerns  mental health and well-being I think  we've checked all the boxes they're  literally all every single box we are we  we're the perfect pocket I mean what  else do we even need to do I think I  might have some [ __ ] in my phone but  I'll see I have notes for all kinds of  things yes even notes you got I always  forget about [ __ ] I want to talk about  anyway I do too I didn't take any notes  I got some creepy [ __ ] for you yeah uh  never in my life have I ever been into  eating peppers and onions really I don't  hate it but it's nothing I ever seek out  you know yeah and then all of a sudden  dude I was just like I'm [ __ ] craving  peppers and onions and not just a little  bit yeah every meal like I was like a  whole onion a whole pepper  at least at breakfast and at least at  dinner like with whatever I was eating  if I was having eggs  just knows what you need right so then  Dee comes downstairs and she's like one  day after like a month or two of this  she's like are you eating peppers and  onions and I'm like yeah she's like  Ron was obsessed with peppers and onions  he would cook it all the time oh that is  weird and I was like what you know and  then Alex is like are you being  possessed by my dad because I got super  into getting a bike and all this yeah so  weird and it's still like it's not as  bad as it was when it first started yeah  just all of a sudden bro I turned 40 I  started eating oatmeal peppers and  onions and [ __ ] I like different [ __ ]  care about snow blowing I never really  liked mustard on things that much now I  [ __ ] love it you're crazy but it was  the best yeah now I do but I never gave  a [ __ ] the goat the goat of all spices  yeah  a lot of this is way  way deep  a lot of stuff we've also touched on  yeah I feel like we see if there's  questions oh look I don't know let's see  let's see what we got here got a  question we got an answer yeah  [Music]  I don't really know I feel like I feel  like this is pretty long though yeah I  mean it's almost [ __ ] 130 so the shop  opens in 30 minutes so oh [ __ ] someone's  a real question did y'all see Ted in  that Christmas movie last month  no I didn't know I don't know what movie  that is  yeah well Christmas movie I don't know  do Will Ferrell Musical one that was  funny  you see any good movies lately  um  yeah Barbarian have you seen it  Barbarian yo it's a horror movie dude  the the title is not what you think like  you think Barbarian you think like some  Warrior type but it's just  it's a tricky like I'm not a big hard  guy I never have been so when people go  oh here's a horror movie I'm always like  I guess I'll [ __ ] sit through it like  it I'm sure it'll be fun but like I just  don't care it's not like they don't  catch me unless it's like a thriller and  this one  it's pretty good I you I don't know I I  it's good and it has some real switches  that are like you're like what the [ __ ]  just happened like it's good that one  was good and then I keep hearing about  the prisoner I I haven't seen it yet but  that's another like tricky horror  Thriller type of thing  and uh Josh who loves her said the  prisoner is like a five of five top  movie he also loved Barbarian  but um then somebody else I was talking  to the other day randomly you gotta  write these down because I won't  remember prisoner and Barbarian yeah and  somebody the other day I was just  talking to randomly he was like have you  seen the prisoner yet I'm like no  they're like oh dude best movie of the  year that [ __ ] is crazy so I'm like all  right I'll check those two out I'll  watch  um I think it's a little older uh the  northmen or something I don't know  doctor's [ __ ] is crazy well it's like  Viking [ __ ] oh really [ __ ] insane I  don't even remember the details of the  movie I need to re-watch it but I just  that's one movie that stands out that I  saw  I saw that second  um The Glass Onion oh yeah was it good  it's D I mean you know for what it is  yeah entertaining or whatever yeah I  like to think of the bad movies I don't  think I've watched that much  I haven't watched too many movies I  don't think anything else has come out I  watched smile which was another horror  movie I give a guy who went down this  little horror rabbit hole but smiled to  me was whack it was just like this girl  has this big smile and then she kills  people and then like someone else gets  the smile from her it's like contagious  but like they become killers and I like  yeah it was very shocking like all you  know they kind of jump out of your seat  type hard they turn the corner and  there's a girl there with a smile and  then they're dead and it's like I don't  know I didn't that [ __ ] I put me to  sleep I didn't even see the end of it so  if the ending is mind-blowing then I  [ __ ] missed it but I couldn't sit  through it I feel like I remember the  like trailer for that yeah it was like  falling off the trailer I get like boom  boom boom scare scare scare and you're  like oh my God this [ __ ] looks wild but  that's the way they always do though  yeah it's nothing more than a bunch of  [ __ ] stupid scares that's just not  scary the other ones where they makes  you think the whole time you're in  suspense guessing oh is this that's the  person oh they're they I don't know it's  not wait but you know like that's it  that I like that that makes me kind of  jump around and think about it but like  uh someone asked thoughts on Kevin Smith  movies I like most Kevin Smith movies I  think Mall Rats is whack now like you  try to go back and watch it the acting  is so bad  I like Kevin Smith I like his movies  Dogma was a great movie yeah  um I found it finally you know you can't  buy Dogma I still haven't seen it I sent  it to you I know yeah I download it but  you can't buy it anywhere so yeah I  can't think of anything else someone  said the Northman that is what that's  what I said yeah all right okay yeah  yeah  um yeah they said that was good  well it has a question mark so I don't  know if I said it I figured maybe I  called it the wrong thing or something  but yeah the north I don't know  um [ __ ] man I guess we'll roll out of  here [ __ ] I don't know yeah that's it  I'm sure we touched on Plenty of things  so we'll be back we're back for number  80. yes it's a certified Hood classic  trap a
