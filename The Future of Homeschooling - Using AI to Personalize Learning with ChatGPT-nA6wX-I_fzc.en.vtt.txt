 so I asked chat GPT if they could help  me develop a basic fifth grade math  curriculum let's say that I needed to  homeschool my kid right and I wanted to  use AI to develop out what the  curriculum would look like and I don't  know what I'm doing right this this chat  will tell you so I said hey can you  provide links to learning resources  worksheets planning courses I want the  entire curriculum to be free please  describe in detail how I would teach  this curriculum every week how long I  should spend on what content and then  describe exactly what lesson content I  should be teaching every week give me a  day by day breakdown of what lessons I  should teach over the entire school year  Okay cool so  it came through it gave some uh basic  overview of like what fifth grade math  consists of now I don't know how deep it  goes into some things like algebra and  geometry that seems a little bit deep  but we're you know brushing the surface  I think at that level and uh you know  it's just some kind of healthy overviews  then it gives you reference to three  videos or three sites that have uh free  resources so I excel Math Antics and  Khan Academy So based off of this you  should be able to go and find some free  resources that you could just take your  kid give them that and then from there  follow this kind of broad schedule so  what I can do is I'm going to ask it to  actually expand on what it's giving me  now because we haven't gotten a day by  day schedule so I could say hey can you  plan two solid weeks  of math lessons day by day  so I'm asking it can you plan out the  next two weeks of math lessons based on  this fifth grade math curriculum so  we're it's probably going to assume I'm  hoping that we're starting from zero and  we're rolling through  based off of just you know day one so  from here it says Hey on Monday let's  start with decimals on Tuesday let's do  decibels and fractions then on Wednesday  comparing and ordering decimals Thursday  reviewing decimals and you're pretty  much just spending the whole week on  that Friday you've got a quiz on  decimals so one thing that we can  actually do is we can go in depth with  this and we can say hey can you make me  that quiz on decimals so that I have  that content to give to my kid I can  like print it out and then give it to  them because it just said hey do it give  me a quiz on decimals and I'm gonna be  like well can you make that for me and  it can so this is really cool we can  actually develop the curriculum live as  we're right here now I'm asking it  explicitly for a 10 question fifth grade  math level quiz on decimals but I could  have just said hey can you give me that  Friday quiz and it wouldn't know what  you're asking for so here we go it's  saying yeah here's the the quiz is  multiple choice and it's breaking it  down and what I'm going to do is like  let's say that you're a parent and you  just completely just blanked on  everything that you learned in school  like a lot of people did which is fun  right you're not necessarily working out  decimals every day let's say and you  want to know okay well just can you just  tell me what the answer key is for this  quiz so that I can grade it  appropriately and we can ask you for  that too so it's spitting out we're  running through it's got a bunch of uh  great questions here we're going to say  hey can you give me an answer key for  this so ask for the answer key and we'll  see what it comes back  um now these are you know we could have  just gone to Google and we could have  looked this up but we don't even need to  with a very very simple  ask it will give us the full answer key  for the quiz so we have no barriers now  we have a full breakdown lesson plan uh  access to free resources we could have  paid for some resources and then we  could feed those resources in and ask  for more refinement but it generated a  quiz for us it generated an answer key  so we pretty much have everything that  we need to go out and teach uh fifth  grade math I'm also going to ask it how  much time per day should I spend on the  lessons and then I ask for any advice on  how to effectively use that time so be  interesting to see what this says and  honestly all of this information is  coming from basically a gigantic copy of  the internet pre-2021 so this is sort of  condensing all of the home school  advice on the internet pretty much  based off of your ask based off of what  this thing wants to give you at the  current time so this is like the the  best version of a Google search you  could ever hope to accomplish so  it's giving you a 45 minute guide it  says let's do a warm-up  introduce A New Concept and then have  them do some independent practice and  have a little bit of review and then you  know try to mix it up every day to keep  it  interesting so overall this is really  cool I think this is going to be a game  changer for homeschoolers and  homeschooling I hope this is is helpful  to you and if it was please hit that  like button and drop a comment about how  this helped you and thank you so much  for watching and have a good one
