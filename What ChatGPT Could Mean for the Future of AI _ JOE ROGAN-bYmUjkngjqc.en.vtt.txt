 want to talk about  chat GPT  [Music]  fascinating question yeah have you  experimented with it I have not but  someone uh the the gentleman who runs  the JRE companion page  um made a wrap with chat GPT  like uh was it was it if Kanye West  wrote a rap for chat GPT they put it on  Instagram but it's it it's like it seems  like a person saying it like you want to  try it no we could try either you are I  mean it takes a long time his thing took  like 48 minutes to do well whatever you  want to look up right now we can do it  yeah the problem is you have to cajole  it it'll get something wrong and you  have to let's just explain what it is so  chat GPT is a large language model  trained artificial intelligence which is  let's just say it can be awful but it is  often surprisingly good at answering  questions you might have about how to do  things one of the great triumphs of it  is that coders are now asking it to  solve coding problems and it will  actually write code that is functional  it's pretty amazing amazing and it also  there's a an implementation of it that  if you feed it up to three tweets it  will write a New York Times story in one  of five genres you know optimistic  pessimistic neutral and  um you know it's you don't really need  the New York Times anymore because it's  pretty good at this job right so  on the one hand it's all very  interesting that we're living in an era  in which there is  at least I mean you know and this is a  prototype right this is a prototype that  was specifically trained and then placed  on the internet so people could play  with it and I've seen lots of  interesting  uses it's going to get better right  we're dealing with chat GPT 3 there's  going to be a chat gpt4 which is going  to be that much better because it will  be built with the uh improvements that  have been gained through turning this  one loose on the world but I have to say  I am  quite alarmed  not only that this thing exists but I  don't think we're ready for it  and I don't think we're ready for it in  a couple different ways I mean if you  wanna  Comfort yourself and say well this isn't  that serious that we have this AI that  can do these really shocking things the  the comforting thing is that the way  it's programmed it doesn't know what  it's saying it doesn't matter that it  convinces you that it's  saying something and it means it and you  know that it seems like a creative  entity what it's doing is it is  basically  using a predictive model that has been  trained
