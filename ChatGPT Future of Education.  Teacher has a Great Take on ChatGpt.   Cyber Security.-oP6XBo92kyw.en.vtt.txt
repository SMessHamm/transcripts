 Professor Black Ops you see it let's get  it  teacher Embraces chat CPT most teachers  sent uh professors are actually scared  of Jack GPT so I thought this was a  unique video so let's check it out real  quick let me re-share that  Sherry you were a teacher why do you  think chat CPT should not be banned  well it's so helpful in so many ways  um uh when it first came out I made wide  use of it before anybody said anything  that I couldn't so I started immediately  seeing benefits to using it it can  generate educational content like  nobody's business it can create lesson  plans it can create study guides it can  create  um lists uh thesis statements all kinds  of scaffolding for students which is  wonderful I love how it works uh  previous to this uh generating lesson  plans would take hours and hours of a  teacher's time and now it just takes  minutes and that frees teachers up to do  other things not to mention fewer hours  at home working or no pay where do you  think the line is with chatgpt where it  might Aid a student as you say or it  might do the work for it  well I think that is where the good  teaching comes into play good teaching  practices uh you have to have  discussions with students you have to  lay out the framework for students um  for good questioning I think businesses  and the workplace is going to change so  dramatically we're going to be asking AI  questions and I think that's what we  have to teach students to do we have to  teach students to ask AI the right  questions in order to get help with  their work not to do it for them  foreign  once again I thought that was a great  take by that teacher shout out to her  she's trying to think towards the future  and obviously she's getting her students  up there I don't think most professors  are or even especially teachers are  ready for chat GPT once again Professor  Black Ops please subscribe
