 recently there's been an exciting  Whirlwind in the field of artificial  intelligence you're probably seeing  fantasy inspired portraits of friends  and celebrities pop up on social media  from the app lensa if you're techy then  you'll definitely have heard of open  ai's chat GPT making headlines doing  everything from writing blog posts to  python code what struck me wasn't just  how cool these apps are but their second  order of social effects in today's video  I'll show how lenses popularity could be  an important stepping stone towards a  metaverse and how we can avoid a  dystopian Ready Player One future  hi I'm Shang and I run my map Nation a  community of my mappers and connective  thinkers if you're not familiar with the  app lensa it is an awesome app that  basically creates AI generated portraits  of you based on 13 to 20 selfies that  you upload each of the packs will cost  anywhere between eight to fifty dollars  depending on how many portraits you want  to generate I was pretty surprised when  one of my friends who is actually  struggling financially began posting  lenza portraits of herself on Instagram  the fact that everyone regardless of  socioeconomic status is willing to pay  this amount of money to generate  realistic avatars of themselves means a  big part of the metaverse equation is  beginning to be solved that is immersion  immersion is a metaverse term to  describe basically two things one in  virtual reality fooling ourselves enough  to believe that we're actually inside  the virtual world or in augmented  realities case seeing digital objects in  the real world as if they were physical  objects immersion is key to people  adopting the metaverse in the first  place people typically associate  immersion with influencing the senses  that is hearing touch smell taste and  especially Vision because up to 60  percent of our brain is dedicated to  processing visual information if you can  manipulate the senses enough you can  fool the brain into thinking that the  digital is real but something even more  powerful is our own imagination in order  to imagine ourselves in a digital world  is to see ourselves there not just in  first person perspective as most AR VR  demos show but as realistically create  avatars of ourselves residing in a  digital world don't believe me on  Instagram the most popular photos and  videos are of people in the third person  rather than what they see that is cities  and Landscapes sweeping scenery we are  naturally drawn or biased towards the  human face and body the purpose of  immersion is for the user to feel  attached to the digital world which  drives engagement and time spent there  which in turn drives monetization and  there's nothing more attached than our  own self-image or identity Lanza has  shown that one the technology has  matured enough to enable realistic  consistent and affordable reproduction  of our likeliness without expensive  motion capture or mocap equipment and  two the willingness of the general  public to pay for it its success will  drive both research and commercial  interest both startups and big Tech  firms are watching this like a hawk it's  not unlikely that we'll begin seeing  moving avatars against fantastic  backdrops soon big Computing Paradigm  jumps let's say from PC to Mobile in  this case from Mobile to metaverse  require an ecosystem a complementary  Technologies and parallel Trends rather  than the success of any one app or  platform in this way chat GPT the open  AI chatbot that's been Making Waves has  a role to play in at least three ways  number one enhancing NPC or non-player  character intelligence making digital  experiences much more impelling with  human-like AI characters in other words  cash gbt and AI models like it make the  digital more human while lenza makes us  humans more digital the future then  meets somewhere in between number two  making the creation of digital  experiences more affordable and faster  by automating parts of the coding and  design process for starters number three  the disruption you have not displacement  of knowledge worker jobs here's a quick  note why will knowledge worker jobs be  automated first it's because manual  labor jobs are extremely difficult to  replace with robots The Fallout of the  10 billion dollar self-driving car hype  has shown us attack safety and  Regulatory challenges of putting robots  in the physical world on the other hand  anything that can be done on the  computer can be digitized and hence  learned by the AI and be automated  adapting to this new paradigm will  require a mindset shift at the minimum  that is being able to reframe these new  technologies as opportunities rather  than threats so that we can learn how to  best use them such as learning prompts  so that the AI can generate the right  output as well as a societal change this  then begs the question of what happens  next nobody really knows but I can paint  one possible future in four stages  more AI generated photos of people and  places will appear in our feeds  especially those with people in places  this will desensitize us not only to AI  generated media but also in real life  photos and videos because number one we  get used to it this is the state of  landscape photography at the moment  where fantastic scenery is a dime a  dozen that we actually start taking it  for granted number two it's cognitively  expensive to determine what is real  versus fake it's a lot easier to just  Bunch them together this is why fake  news is so effective which chat GPT  honestly will probably add fuel to fire  since many people travel for the gram  this decrease in Social validation makes  the expense time and hassle of getting  to real places less appealing meanwhile  digital experiences and media will only  get better with all the advances that  we're talking about thereby making these  cheaper alternatives relatively more  attractive  stage two more people move into the  digital world in other words the  metaverse if mobile apps have taught us  anything is that more engagement with  them results in more immersion and  attachment  [Music]  stage 3 democratizes the metaverse  because everyone's beautiful and perfect  as digital avatars most digital  experiences are affordable and  everyone's happy  [Music]  Stitch 4 is the digital Recreation a  real world class divide because how do  you stand out when everyone's perfect  you spend money on differentiation  whether that's buying more expensive  accessories digital experiences or form  exclusive clicks all the while we become  more immersed or more attached to the  digital world if everyone in your circle  is there doing activities then Network  effects will make them even stickier  meanwhile our real life to satisfaction  increases as the world becomes more  turbulent due to the gazillion things  that we hear about in the news ranging  from geopolitical conflicts to Market  crashes this then increases the demand  for accessible digital experiences that  act as both a distraction and mental  relaxation which really are two sides  the same coin the time scale of the  scenario is anyone's guess but the  underlying advances human nature and  Trends make it very possible so how do  we avoid this dystopian Future Let's go  back in history for a second the famous  economist John Keynes in 1930 predicted  that his grandkids would work just two  days a week thanks to the rate of  productivity growth and automation the  average American workers productivity  has indeed increased by 430 percent  since 1950 therefore it should either  take less than 10 hours a week to have  the same living standards as someone in  1950 or a standard living is four times  better obviously this is not our reality  John Keynes might have even considered  our present a dystopian future I wrote a  deep dye article that I'll link below  explaining how we came to be but the  tldr is that it is not a technology  problem it is a human in systems problem  based on a combination of our insatiable  personal demand for more stuff plus  inequitable wealth distribution or the  fruits of our Collective economic growth  what I like to say is that the nature of  a solution or an answer must match that  of the problem therefore the solution  does not lie in our advances but rather  within ourselves since it's a human  problem we don't need to look to AI to  solve it instead I turn to the Ancients  Aristotle had a good answer as he saw  Leisure Time as the goal of all human  behavior the end towards which all  action is directed but his definition of  leisure wasn't about having fun or  binging on Netflix but rather becoming a  complete well-rounded human being in  other words free time is used to  cultivate our minds and character of  discovering and doing things that bring  us lasting fulfillment perhaps maybe  even informed and accountable members of  society our current work and cultural  Paradigm forces us in the opposite  direction to the extent that even our  minuscule leisure time is used to  recuperate through distraction and work  disguise as vacation so if our air  advances and automation will have any  chance of saving us from a dystopian  outcome we will need to work towards  Building Systems that gives us back our  time in order to do that that we have to  get a handle on ourselves first two  thousand years ago the stoic philosopher  Senegal said it is first to have what is  necessary and second to have what is  enough because if we don't know what's  enough we'll always feel poor and  miserable it is this very discontentment  that drives our need to work more make  more and consume more at the end of the  day the change is actually in our hands  but that's also the hard part  thank you so much for tuning in if you  found this topic fascinating you might  want to check out our my map Nation  Community because that's actually what  we talk about not just about my mapping  and professional growth but also about  how everything is connected in a greater  whole and how we can use these insights  to help us adapt to the Future alright  guys until next time take care
