 Welcome to this video about ChatGPT and&nbsp; accounting. ChatGPT is a program that can&nbsp;&nbsp; reportedly generate answers to accounting problems&nbsp; so we thought we'd put it to the test. I've got&nbsp;&nbsp; three examples here I'm going to run through that&nbsp; have been provided to me by accounting lecturers&nbsp;&nbsp; and I've put them into the chat box in ChatGPT&nbsp; and we're going to see what the output is like.&nbsp;&nbsp; You can see it took a little moment to think about&nbsp; it and then started within seconds generating the&nbsp;&nbsp; outputs. And I've sped this up a little bit&nbsp; because it takes a little bit of time which&nbsp;&nbsp; you probably don't have because you're going&nbsp; to be going out learning how to use ChatGPT. So this is the second example 'Whisk and&nbsp; Whim'. Another question put it into chat&nbsp;&nbsp; box seeing what's happening and I've put&nbsp; the full answer on a larger screen so you&nbsp;&nbsp; can pause it if you're an accounting educator or&nbsp; an accountant and tell me is this good quality.&nbsp;&nbsp; Example three 'ABC Limited'. Once again the whole&nbsp; question gets chucked in that chat box click enter&nbsp;&nbsp; and within a second or less than a second&nbsp; the answer is appearing on screen. Now I&nbsp;&nbsp; have no background in accounting so&nbsp; I have no idea if this is garbage or&nbsp;&nbsp; not so let me know... Can ChatGPT&nbsp; answer accounting exam questions?
