 um you mentioned the chat GPC earlier  you know I I played a significant role  in the creation of openai  um essentially at the time I was  concerned that Google was not paying  enough attention to AI safety and  um  and so I I with a number of other people  um  created opening and although initially  it was created as an open source  non-profit  and now it is closed source and for  profit I don't have any stake in open AI  anymore nor am I on the board nor do I  control it in any way  um  but the chat GPS I think has Illustrated  to  people just how advanced AI has become  um because the ad has been in advance  for a while it just didn't have a user  interface that was  um accessible to most people  um so what really charge EBT has done is  just put an accessible user interface on  AI technology that is  um this has been present for a few years  and there are much more advanced  versions of that that are coming out  um  so I think we you know I think we need  to really be  I think we need to regulate AIC frankly  um because  if you think of any  um technology which is potentially a  risk to  to people like if it's an aircraft or uh  you know cars or  medicine we have regulatory bodies that  oversee the public safety of cars and  planes and medicine and  um  I think we should probably we should  have a a similar sort of regulatory  oversight for artificial intelligence  because  um it is I think actually a vigorous to  society than uh cars or plans or or  medicine  um  so  um and this may have to slow down AI a  little bit but I think that that might  also be a good thing  um  the the challenge here is that a  government regulatory uh  authorities tend to be set up in  reaction to something bad that happened  so if you look at say aircraft or cars  you know the cars were unregulated at  the beginning aircraft were unregulated  but they had lots of  um  you know airplane crashes and in some  cases manufacturers that were cutting  corners and and a lot of people were  dying so they the public was not happy  about that and so they established a  regulatory authority to improve safety  and now commercial airliners are  extremely safe  um  in fact they're safe and then if you  were to drive somewhere uh it's a safety  for a mile of a commercial airliner is  better than a car and cars are also  extremely safe compared to where they  used to be  um so  um but if you say if you look at say the  introduction of seat belts uh the Auto  industry fought the introduction of seat  belts as a safety manager for I think 10  or 15 years  before finally The Regulators made them  put seat belts and cars and that  greatly improved the safety of cars and  that airbags were another big  Improvement in safety so  um my concern is that with AI if if  there's something bad that something  goes wrong  um  the reaction might be too slow from a  regulatory standpoint  um  so I I would say like it you know if  it's like one of the biggest risks to  the future of civilization  um  it's both positive or negative it has  great great promise great capability but  it also with that comes great danger I  mean like I say nuclear it you know just  discovery of sort of nuclear physics uh  you had nuclear power generation but  also nuclear bombs  um  so anyway I think we should be quite  concerned about it and we should uh  have some regulation of what is it if a  fundamentally um a risk to the public so  you know I I thought the  it was important for the future of  civilization to  [Music]  try to correct that uh  thumb on the scale if you will  um  and and uh and just have Twitter more  accurately reflect uh like I said the  the values of the the people of Earth  um  that's the intention  um and uh hopefully we succeed in doing  that sure  um yeah uh but how do you see Twitter if  we would say it five years down the road  what's your vision for for this platform  what what should it do  well I think it'd be I'd like to you  know have the sort of long-term mission  of something called uh x.com from back  way back in the day uh which is kind of  like a  um sort of like an everything app  um where it's just maximally useful it  does you know payments uh does um  uh so it provides Financial Services  provides information flow  um really anything digital  um and um  it also provides secure Communications  um so it relates to  you know I think it'd be as useful as  possible as entertaining as possible  um and also to be like a a source of of  Truth like if you want to uh  find out what's going on and what's  really going on  um then you could be able to go on on on  you know X the X app and uh  and and find out  so it's a sort of source it's sort of a  source of Truth and a maximally useful  I guess app is about the wrong word but  system  um and Twitter is essentially an  accelerant to that sort of maximally  useful everything app  um  yeah how how you are gonna I mean if you  look at Twitter today I mean it's it's a  platform sometimes there is a lot of  misinformation in Twitter  sometimes I don't feel comfortable even  because there is  some way there is this negative between  Nation between people between different  ethnic group that is the same thing how  you are how we are going to fix this  issue where you are you are in a mission  with for Humanity to get them together  yeah  um  I think there's  um there's something that we're putting  a lot of efforts into called Community  notes  um it's currently just in English but we  will be expanding it to all languages  that is I think quite a good way to  assess the truth to things where it's  the community itself basically the you  know the people of Earth who are  basically but you know  um not exactly voting but but competing  to provide the most accurate information  so it's sort of a competition for truth  um  and I think it's a very powerful concept  to have a competition for truth  um  because you also said like what what is  true it's because what may be true to  some may not be viewed as true to others  but you want to have the closest  approximation of that
