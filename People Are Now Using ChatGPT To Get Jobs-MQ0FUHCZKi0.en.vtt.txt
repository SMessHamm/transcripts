 over the past month the new AI chat bot  called chat GPT has been drawing a lot  of attention and uh big predictions  about how it might cause problems with  uh automatic generation of school  assignments essays maybe even scripts  and novels someday but we want to stick  with business because what if you could  use a chat bot like this to help you get  a job  not necessarily in making up your entire  resume I'll leave that to George Santos  but maybe writing a cover letter or  something like that there was an  experiment done in this area and we're  gonna get to it in a second but just in  case you're not that familiar with how  these AI chat Bots work take a look at  this  alongside chat GPT and Dali 2 is gpt3 a  natural language system that can also  write argue and code and chat GPT uses  an upgraded version of this to create  text at incredible speeds according to a  statement from open AI we've trained a  model called chat GPT which interacts in  a conversational way the dialog format  makes it possible for chat GPT to answer  follow-up questions admits mistakes  challenge incorrect premises and reject  inappropriate requests the software  itself has been trained by Ai and  machine learning with massive amounts of  text Data from various sources it  corrects grammar it summarizes difficult  text into simple Concepts it converts  movies into emojis and it fixes bugs in  Python code  and so you can see there the basic idea  of how this works now I've used chat GPT  quite a bit and I think their  description there was quite accurate  both of uh how it works some of its  limitations but when it comes to getting  a job uh we're gonna talk about an  experiment that was run by Beatrice  Nolan of Business Insider who use chat  GPT uh to look at job descriptions and  put together cover letters to try to  potentially get hired for that job and  used it  um to give to the people who evaluate  these sorts of things to see what they  thought of it so uh one of the jobs was  for a social media assistant another was  for a purchase Ledger Clerk and the two  different recruiters that evaluated  these cover letters said that they  looked like they'd been written by  genuine candidates it was not in any way  immediately clear that these were  entirely produced by an AI chat bot not  by an actual human one who works for  Reed Chris wilshere said we would likely  think this was written by a genuine  candidate and follow up with a screening  call the structure of the letter is good  but it lacks some detail around the  company they're applying for Stephanie  Petry of jobber says their writing style  is not what I would expect from someone  in that role their tone is too formal  and dry and I'd expect them to show more  creativity and character and by the way  in my own use of chat GPT it does tend  to start off pretty formal pretty dry  but the thing is you can take something  that it's generated for instance a cover  letter like this that the tone might not  be right for and you can say I want you  to remake this but be more  conversational you use more slang maybe  throw in a joke and it will reevaluate  and do that and so this experiment was  like the most simplistic version you  feed in a bit of information about the  job and then the first pass of what it  produces is what you give but if  somebody was willing to put in just a  little bit of time to add a few extra  facts and maybe tweak the the style a  little bit I could see this potentially  being used by people to get inquiries  from people hiring  I can even see it being used to replace  talk show hosts  I I've actually done some research and  that's largely what's happened on CNN  and MSNBC for several decades  well by the way they 100 there you go I  mean if wolf blitzer's real name is it  Chad GPT I don't know what it is okay so  um look uh I think  this is an interesting sign of the times  because  everything is about to be fake uh We've  Got Deep fakes we've got videos now  where it is really hard to tell if they  if that's the real person or not the  real person in the video you got  pictures that are nearly impossible to  tell that's been around for quite some  time uh and uh and now you've got things  that can be written uh and and created  that sound very human either a formal  human or maybe even a less formal human  uh so  we're about to enter a Trippy world I  mean it's already super trippy I mean if  just ask your parents uh what they think  and they'll tell you some nonsense they  read on Facebook uh that's even close to  true but we're about to supercharge that  Jordan what do you think  you know I don't know how I feel about  it I'm kind like I I agree with you Jake  it the future is really strange and  uncertain and the role not just like  deep fakes and things like this like AI  generating images or art or and now text  but also just the way social media has  been fully integrated into our lives and  a key component of Our Lives  I I it just it seems deeply unhealthy  but since you know we're almost out of  time it's the end of the year I'm gonna  argue that this is a good thing because  applying for jobs  sucks applying for job after job if  you're really desperate to find a job  the worst part is the cover letters  because  most employers don't even read them they  read the first graph they look at your  resume and they decide within 30 seconds  whether or not they like you like I I'd  say on this issue specifically go for it  spam chat GPT and fill out those stupid  cover letters in in 2023 I really hope  we can move Beyond requiring a cover  letter or a written statement or writing  assignments all this extra homework for  these jobs especially when  when doing that there's no guarantee  you're even going to get a call back it  is it is such a hurdle for people to  apply for these jobs over and over and  over again especially if they're  desperate to find work  I say go for it I don't care that's that  I'm just going to be a contrarian on  this point I think that's fair so  yeah I I agree and disagree so first of  all uh I remember when I used to apply  for jobs cover letters were the worst I  hated cover letters why do you make me  write this thing that is obviously  inauthentic okay but Jordan as it turns  out you're wrong sometimes people do  read the cover letters because I did  have one cover letter that I wrote that  was very authentic it was a job I really  wanted and Frank Luntz did reply back  saying it was a wonderful cover letter  that is a true story from about 27 years  ago when I was graduating from law  school I was in political nerd and I  knew Frank once was an incredible poster  which is true he's the top Republican  pollster and back then I was a  Republican and I wrote this heartfelt  cover letter and he's like man damn that  was good nonetheless didn't hire me  maybe he sniffed out lib somewhere in  there and it's gonna go wrong so he was  right about that too uh but look one of  the things that I have a problem with is  nobody's going to write a an actual uh  homework assignment from now on I mean  my kids already cheat on spelling  grammar none stop the minute they're on  the computer the computer fixes all  their spelling so they don't know how to  spell anything and then uh and now since  John explained that you could  personalize things uh on chat gbt and  say you know because in the old days so  I graded exams for troubled students on  some silly TV show that I was a part of  and half the kids just took giant blocks  from Wikipedia and put it into their  papers it was hilarious because it's  like they're barely trying like some  would leave wikipedia.com on their dot  org whatever on there right and I'm like  guys this is this is awful right but if  chat gbt could personalize it which it  sounds like you can  we're gonna have no idea that the papers  are fake everything's gonna be fake I no  I won't know uh let the record note that  my vote is irrelevant and the future is  fake  John my last question to you is so what  do you use it for that's legit well  really fast I'll say I disagree with  your last point I I don't know how to  express my thoughts but I'm going to use  my computer for a second and have it  come up with a counter argument which it  could totally do by the way uh so I've  tried to use it for creative stuff  trying to help me in like honestly for  my fiction writing like doing some like  World building stuff trying to get it to  be creative and synthesize different  things the limitation is that it's not a  particularly creative there are there  are big limitations this it's not super  creative it effectively reads a bunch of  stuff online and will tell it to you it  doesn't know if what it's saying is  interesting it doesn't know if what it's  saying is true it knows that things are  facts in that it's found them somewhere  but it can't evaluate critically whether  the things it's saying are true it tends  to use a similar voice from topic to  topic and so after you've used this a  lot you can almost tell when something  has been produced by it it's not clear  to someone who's new but there are ticks  that it uses it is already incredible  and I'm sure it'll get get better but  I've found it to actually be quite  Limited at least in the way that I would  want to use it  all right so we'll have to wait a tiny  bit before the future becomes completely  fake  fair enough thanks for watching The  Young Turks I really appreciate it  another way to show support is through  YouTube memberships you'll get to  interact with us more there's live chat  emojis badges you've got emojis of me  Anna John Jr so those are super fun but  you also get playback of our exclusive  member only shows and specials right  after they air so all that all you gotta  do is click that join button right  underneath the video thank
