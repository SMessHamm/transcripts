 artificial intelligence is the future in  the future is now  [Music]  yeah yeah guys check it out I am on  singularitynet.io this is one of my  all-time favorite cryptocurrency  projects that I think is going to really  revolutionize the economy and how we  look at our everydays lives I mean we're  going to be talking about you know you  you actually go on the internet now  you're already seeing AI starting to  trend on social media there's been a lot  of hype about this chat openai.com  that's basically a chat gbt that  essentially can pretty much do anything  you need to do whether it's the right  code whether it's to make characters for  a book I mean make artwork you name it  it's able to do it in fact I even asked  it as you can see here I wrote I said I  need an introduction about  singularitynet and artificial  intelligence for my YouTube channel and  this is what it wrote Guys  it wrote out for me it spelled it out  singularitynet is a decentralized  platform for AI Services it allows  individual AI algorithms to be bought  and sold in a decentralized market using  the platform's native agix token this  allows anyone to access and use the AI  Technologies helping to democratize  access to the technology artificial  intelligence or AI refers to the ability  of a computer or machine to mimic human  cognitive abilities such as learning and  problem solving AI has the potential to  revolutionize many fields from medicine  to Transportation by automain tasks and  making them more efficient however it  also raises important and ethical  concerns and questions about the future  of work and human machine  interactions yeah guys this is what it  spelled out to me so sometimes I notice  like when they're is a high demand it  can sometimes be laggy but overall it  generally works really really well uh  like I said here here I'll show you guys  approve it again I need an introduction  for my channel on singularitynet  watch this guys watch it work thinking  long guys look at it boom  hi welcome to my channel on  singularitynet my name is blah blah I am  a passion about potential of  decentralized AI and blockchain  Technology to revolutionize the way we  live and work on this channel I'll be  sharing my thoughts insights and updates  on the latest developments in  singularinet ecosystem for those who are  not familiar with singular net is a  decentralized Marketplace for AI  services that allow anyone to buy and  sell AI Services algorithms and models  in a transparent open way guys you just  witnessed AI just basically literally  helped me create an introduction for  this video  like this is proof in the pudding and  guys artificial intelligence is the  future as you guys could see here dude  it basically this made my life a whole  lot easier and it did it within seconds  and talk about singular net why is this  important for single internet well  singularitynet is basically a  Marketplace for people to buy Services  just like chat gbt  and they will only be able to buy those  services using their native token the  agix token  and that is why I am a huge believer of  this project and of singulairnet and the  agix token I think the value of this  token is obviously extremely undervalued  considering that people are going to  need to buy this token in order to use  the services on the platform  that's what I'm really Blown Away on now  guys like I said full disclosure here  I'm holding about 35  000 singular net tokens I do plan on  accumulating more if the price does go  down uh my goal is to eventually have 50  maybe a hundred thousand singular net  tokens before the next Bull Run which  you know I expect it to happen sometime  next year and I plan on holding it until  at least one dollar guys I'm not gonna  be dumping on it guys I'm not you know  there's already been those lawsuits that  you know I don't want the SEC after me  or anything like that uh full disclosure  here  not getting paid by singular net they  don't even pay for shills not that I'm  aware of  um and uh yeah just a big believer lover  of the project I'm a holder and I plan  on hold it until at least one dollar  guys one dollar maybe ten dollars we'll  see but I will try to start I will will  start price selling after one dollar  that's  that's yeah buddy so more to talk about  here I got some videos here as well to  show you guys  this is more about the chat uh chat gbt  to change our lives forever here we go  can you write a list of 10 viral YouTube  titles to help investors this is Andy  half fell on Tech talk giving him the  credit  s and here they're writing the titles  and then can you write a YouTube video  on Warren Buffett's seven secrets to  successful investing  sure there's a potential outline so it  actually doesn't write the script for us  excuse me Mr chatbot can you make each  paragraph long something crazy add an  introduction and outro in total 1400  words it doesn't I'll do that for you oh  wow  unbelievable God so as you can see right  we are all gonna be jobless guys  on how to turn this into a high quality  video and actually get success I love it  we love it here's another guy listen to  this guy this app  guys this has been trending all week bro  hey Elon Musk co-founder  in other words you give this thing a  prompt and it will do your homework for  you watch this write an essay on the  ethics of having Pokemon fight each  other  [Music]  wow crazy now I want to make sure guys  not to get confused here there is no  singularity in that and chat gbt are not  together like there is no correlation of  the two other than that chat gbt is a  artificial intelligence platform that a  tool that people can use in Singularity  net has features and tools similar to  chat gbt on their platform already that  you can utilize and use and you just  have to purchase them using agix tokens  and you have access it's like a  subscription you're able to utilize  those AI services using the agix token  and talking a little bit more about  singularinet I mean dude I like I said I  love this project welcome the next  generation of decentralized AI what they  really talk about and I think is a  really important is the vision you know  seeing Larry net is the world's leading  decentralized AI Marketplace running on  a blockchain their core mission is  development of the artificial general  intelligence AGI for the beneficial  technological singularity  now decentralized ai through emerging  blockchain technology creating a fair  distribution of power value and  technology in Global Commons so  decentralization is what's really  important about AI because what Ben  gertzel the founder of AI what he really  talks about what he's advocate of and  what he's worried about is if AI becomes  too powerful if it or if it got into the  hands of the wrong people that the the  the advancements of this technology will  be so powering that anyone be able to  easily monopolize the entire world if  they completely controlled or had access  to this technology so he really advocate  and his solution is decentralization  like this technology in order for it to  work it needs to be decentralized and  the way they're using the way it's being  decentralized is using blockchain  technology so yeah lots is going on here  on the website you guys can all find the  links down in the description uh they  even offer agix staking and bridging of  the tokens so more utilization there as  well and if you guys are curious the  agix token is built on the ethereum  blockchain and the cardano blockchain so  it's a cross chain of cardano and  ethereum so yeah look at this Ben  gertzel uh talk about the collaborations  with cardano that's very exciting in  fact I got this very interesting video I  want to show a few minutes of of his  interview Ben gerstall had an interview  with London real and he talked about how  you know talked about artificial  intelligence and how it can impact the  world and eventually how harmful it  could be as well so let's take a quick  listen here  once you get AIS that are massively  smarter than we are we're in a domain  where we're not going to be able to  predict what happened that is scary but  it probably won't stop the singularity  artificial intelligence  [Music]  2029 you've got ai's as smart as people  by 2045 we have AIS boundlessly more  intelligent whatever happens with the  super intelligence its mind state will  be conditioned by the earlier AI what is  AI mostly being used for on the planet  Earth right now runs tanks and automated  gun machines could allow War to be  fought on a scale greater and faster  than ever before so inspiring killing  and gambling are the primary goals and  values in the mind of the first Super  intelligence I mean we're not setting  the best example in terms of the way  Human Society is being regulated right  now nor the way we treat non-human life  Farms on the planet  well if AI treats us the way we treat  less intelligent animals  and what  what it will actually treat humans the  same way that humans treat sub you know  intelligent animals or less intelligent  animals like you know cows and chickens  and things like that  that's crazy I wanted to be more  compassionate to us than we are to each  other  the attitude of wanting to Foster  productivity of all sentient beings is  quite important if we can get that  attitude into our super AI is we're  going to be a lot better off guys  remember this Ben gerstle he is the  founder of singularinet of this project  I want people to start deeply thinking  and to start learning and studying and  to be figuring out how they can best  contribute as to those in my own body  they live an interesting time and I'll  be even more interested  wow guys definitely very inspiring video  you guys definitely should check it out  London real Dr Ben gerstle uh like so  yeah guys let's get in on this project  guys do your due diligence do your  research get involved uh you know what  I'm doing is you know I'm paying  attention following them on their  Twitter account you can follow them on  singularitynet underscore.net  uh you join their their uh platforms on  Telegram and Discord  I think it has bright future guys I  really do uh I'm gonna it's like I said  it's my all-time favorite  and uh but no Financial advice to you  guys no Financial advice like I said I'm  I'm just personally blogging about this  showing you guys why I'm passionate  compassionate about and what I think the  future is for or what I see let's come  in here in the future that's going to  offer a lot of value and use case so let  me know what you guys think down in the  comments uh let us know let me know if
