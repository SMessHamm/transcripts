 yo what's going on guys Gabriel Here  welcome back to another one of my videos  uh this video is going to be completely  unrelated to uh typology at least not  um directly it's gonna be indirectly  some typology in this video but I really  wanted to highlight this because this I  am it's currently three in the morning  uh I am blown away I was going to go to  sleep like two hours ago but I've been  messing around with this program because  this thing is absolutely [ __ ]  incredible if you guys haven't heard  there is this giant hype around this  program this artificial intelligence  uh it's almost it's similar to a search  engine except it can do that much more  for you it's called chat GPT  um this is the the third iteration  um by a company I believe it's a company  um if I'm not mistaken it's actually uh  something that's founded by Elon Musk or  he presently owns the software something  like that but anyways I don't care who  who's owned by uh the software itself is  [ __ ] incredible for there's so many  implications for so many different  Industries  um that this technology is going to  influence and it's really exciting uh I  just wanted to quickly show you kind of  a couple of ways that I've been messing  around with this and how I've actually  been using it to like streamline a lot  of my workflow and get a lot of my uh uh  work done the stuff that's like more  monotonous that I don't want to do but  is fairly simple enough to kind of get  get uh the word around  um and that is for acquiring information  and actually acquiring information that  I haven't even acquired yet  um and what I mean by that is I'm going  to quickly ask a GPT to quickly  um give me a summary of young  psychological type  describing Carl Young's psychological  types  and it will instantly go in Carl Young  was a Swiss psychiatrist and  psychoanalyst who was best known for his  work on the human psyche and his theory  of psychological types young proposed  amazing stuff really really cool  information  um likely you'll be able to find  something similar like this on Wikipedia  or something so this isn't like this is  just scratching the surface  um now let's say  um  describe the introverted sensation type  from Carl Young's theories  and it goes in and it starts describing  the cognitive functions of the  introverted sensation type  um  this is just one way that you can use  this there's other ways another way I've  been using this is for my YouTube titles  um so let's say the next video that I'm  working on which I've already got about  halfway done is the istj versus intj  video  and I was kind of thinking like what's a  good title for it and I asked gbt to  write five titles related  to a video that is about  that is comparing istj and intj and make  the title catchy and  have viral  potential  enter  istj versus intj which personality type  Reigns Supreme The Ultimate Showdown icj  versus intj  the battle of the introverted thinkers  um  although that's not accurate but point  being it's obviously not perfect you do  need to have some level of awareness  around the stuff that you're researching  in order to know when GPT kind of slips  up and gives you wrong information they  both are introverts and they both are  thinkers so technically you can  categorize them as introverted thinkers  but there is a cognitive function  that is introverted thinking so that  would not kind of work out in this case  but the point being it's giving you  Alternatives uh give me five more and  don't use the previous five  and it will continue to give you more  and more  discussions  more and more variables now this isn't  like the extent of it  um I also use this uh I know very very  little programming  um and I know some programmers have been  using this to write like full programs  for them  um some people I don't know if this will  work I haven't tried this yet um  program a  simple version of flappy bird  and it will actually I I don't know that  much about programming  this state is going to [ __ ] write  programs for you obviously with some  level of uh Simplicity behind them and  there will still need to be developers  to implement a lot of these codes  because some most people don't  understand how to implement this stuff  but this is just another industry that  this is going to impact pretty heavily  uh and pretty incredibly and it's just  going to continue to write  um  just insane stuff like it's crazy that  this can do this uh another way that  I've been using this too is  um  for uh I was working on my resume and I  asked GPT to uh give me a cover letter  and I put write a cover letter related  to  um  the  and it will go and it will rate an  entire cover letter for you and then you  can go in and kind of revise it and make  it as nice as you want  um  it's just honestly I had to make this  video because if people aren't taking  advantage of this there's I I seldom do  I get excited for technology on this  level  um the last time I got really excited  like this was when I started researching  the blockchain technology and trying to  wrap my head around that  um and this is making that look like the  radio  that's what it feels like blockchain  technology as as advanced as it is there  is I've never experienced artificial  intelligence and it's crazy because this  is now the mainstream uh version the the  this wouldn't really be characterized as  status state of the art in terms of the  potential that could be that could exist  because this system is fairly new  um and it's still what's really  interesting about this artificial  intelligence this specific program is  the more input that we add the smarter  it gets and the better it gets at  solving better problems and it's just  it's just crazy  um if you guys are in any particular  industry like marketing  um you know programming uh sales  so much you can I can probably ask it to  write like a uh write a marketing email  related to selling dog collars  and it'll probably be able to write to  formulate something  um yeah at XYZ company we know how much  your furry friends mean to you that's  what we're offering wide selection and  it's just it's writing out a [ __ ]  marketing email  um copywriters are going to be are going  to be utilizing this to their advantage  and it's going to make that job that  much easier  um  it's just it's [ __ ] crazy and if you  guys haven't uh I'm gonna put the link  in the description uh you guys  definitely need to check it out because  it's it's this is just  this is game changing  so yeah I just wanted to put that out  there because you guys in case any of  you guys haven't seen this uh it's it's  very very useful
