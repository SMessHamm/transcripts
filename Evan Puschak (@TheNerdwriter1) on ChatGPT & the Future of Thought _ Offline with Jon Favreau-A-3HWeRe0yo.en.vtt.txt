 there was a Princeton student like last  week who created a a app that can detect  chat GPT you know to like you know ruin  all these high schools man what a night  yeah I know exactly what I thought  this is exactly what I did all of his  friends are having fun with Chachi PT  all right I know I'm John Favreau  welcome to offline  my guest today is essayist and YouTuber  Evan pushak also known as the nerdwriter  Evan's known for his in-depth analysis  and commentary on a wide range of topics  including film literature art and  philosophy he's gained a large following  for his ability to explain complex ideas  in an accessible and engaging way he  began his YouTube channel in 2011 and  has since amassed over 3 million  subscribers on today's episode the two  of us will be talking about chat GPT the  artificial intelligence chatbot from  open AI that happens to be responsible  for writing that intro of Evan I just  read Evan recently published a video  essay on the real dangers of chat GPT  which is actually an essay about the  real value of writing Evan argues that  if we fully Outsource writing to chat  GPT and we'll lose something essential  about being human namely our ability to  uniquely Express and understand  ourselves and the world around us  here's Evan pushak Evan pushak welcome  to offline thanks for having me  so I've been wanting to have a  conversation about uh chat GPT for a  while now for those of you who don't  know chat GPT is the new artificial  intelligence conversation bought from  open AI That's so good people think it  it might replace Google high school  English even the entire writing  profession itself  um Evan you recently made a video essay  about this debate uh why did you want to  take this issue on  well I mean I like everyone else was  totally fascinated with chat gbt when it  came out you know the crazy thing is it  only came out like a month and a half  ago and it feels like it's been with us  for so long at this point because yeah  it's really dominated social media too  yeah exactly and it's understandable  because you know I like everyone started  playing with it you know asking it  different kinds of prompts write an  essay on this give me a sonnet in the  style of Shakespeare about corgis or  whatever you know and it it is amazing  what it can churn out and I think you  know it's rhetorical flexibility it's  rhetorical muscle its ability to produce  not just sentences but paragraphs of  coherent text is really really  fascinating  um what kind of  impact it's going to have is I think  still unclear but you know people can't  really resist I think in the first few  days after something like this comes out  saying that all writing is dead or the  essay is going away or you know we love  to think that we're reaching the end of  an era that's just sort of I think what  we're hardwired to to think it could be  that it could be as extreme you know but  it also could be something less you know  less impactful it's hard to say now it's  just it's just really really interesting  and I sort of wanted to to dive into the  implications of that as related to  things that I've been thinking about all  right writing can you can you talk about  how  um the chat chat GPT works just for  people who might not be familiar and and  what's what's the magic here like why  does it seem passively human what is the  what is the bot doing well let me let me  let me start by saying I'm not an expert  in AI or right  um you know large language models which  is what this is It's a large language  model and you know essentially what it  does is  it scrapes the whole internet  essentially all the language on the  internet and what it's doing and there  was actually really interesting paper  about this by Murray Shanahan I just  wanted to shout that out called talking  about large language models where he  essentially says that it's it's based  around this technology of  next token prediction which essentially  means that it you give it a piece of  text and then it looks through all the  language that has ever existed and tries  to predict with it with the highest  amount of accuracy what would go next in  that sentence so you could say you know  he gives the example he could say  twinkle twinkle you know the most likely  next work two words after twinkle  twinkle are going to be Little Star you  know and so yeah it is a high  probability that that's going to be  right  you could say after  Frodo defeated Sauron he returned to  and the most likely answer is going to  be the Shire just because it knows all  of the times that that's been used in  the history of text and just the the the  the amount of text that it's using gives  it its extreme power that that that Lord  of the Rings example is another one that  he used and  into this it adds you know some extra  stuff that allows it to be more accurate  uh humans were were essentially training  it on certain answers and you know  there's a there's a lot that goes into  producing an accurate response to that  you know because it has to understand  what the intention of the asker is which  is why it still has problems you know  which is why it still says often says  things that are completely  incorrect if not nonsensical it's good  at being not nonsensical which is  impressive but it's not great at being  correct and then it says the correct  thing with just the most confidence that  you've ever heard in your life you know  so it's similar you know it's sort of  similar to when I don't know if you had  this experience when I was in school and  college like  all my teachers really really tried to  to get us to not use Wikipedia as a  source because it was not reliable in  terms of as a primary source for things  and that was drilled into us it's sort  of similar to that in that you know it's  going to be accurate uh impressive  amount of times but  you would not be wise to use it as a  primary source on on something that you  you you really want it to be right you  have to check what it's saying  I am feeling old because uh in college  we didn't have Wikipedia yet to be  warned about by  wow yeah I know it's rough  um this is oversimplifying it but it is  basically a really really smart  autocomplete that we have like on our  phones right now for texting which I  think is important as we start talking  about the possibility of it replacing  writing as a profession because I I mean  I I use it a bunch just in preparation  for this interview and I hadn't really  used it all that much before and it is  interesting like using it as a sort of  uh alternative to Google does seem sort  of useful using it because you know you  can ask it like uh where should I what's  a good place to eat in in Los Angeles  that's new or that I want see you know  like you can do that and it will it it's  it's the search results are what it  spits out is much clearer and I think  more helpful than sometimes even what  you get with Google when you try to do  like you know I I asked for a couple  Obama speeches  and it's you know you can tell that it  is using language that Obama uses over  and over again or has used over and over  again  um but it's not fooling anyone  I mean you had a you said in the essay  it's like a it's basically like a B  minus high school student yes and that's  and that's where that's where it starts  to get more interesting or dangerous  depending on how you look at it because  yeah it's not going to be able to  reproduce a John Favreau Obama speech  with any kind of persuasive power that  that you might be able to give it but  you know what's so interesting about  this is that it came out I think  November 30th and I just happened to be  visiting  my parents house for Thanksgiving the  week before  and my parents are trying to sell their  house and part of that process is that  they're making me go through all of my  old stuff of which they have kept all of  it and so I was going through these  boxes of essays that I had written  in elementary school and Junior High in  high school and they are so bad like  they are just so the writing is  torturous you know and what you get most  from it really is how much I really did  not want to be writing those essays  which I think is  important to this whole discussion but  the chat GPT versions of those prompts  are definitely better than what I was  writing  you know and so it can't re you know  it's it's not going to be re able to  reproduce sophisticated writing it just  can't do that maybe in the future it  will but we're not there yet but the  writing of  students particularly high school  students and younger it can reproduce  and it can reproduce it pretty well and  so that does pose I think and some kind  of issue for teachers and for the  education system  you say that um in the essay that maybe  we'll Outsource writing to GPT like we  outsourced math the calculator spelling  to spell check memory to the internet I  want to spend most of our time talking  about writing but do you think that we  have lost anything by Outsourcing math  spelling and especially memory I thought  that one was particularly interesting  um to these Technologies  it's a good question I mean if you're  asking me somebody who is a writer in  the Arts no I have not lost anything  from Outsourcing math to calculators you  know and that's that's another point I  bring up which is that you know the the  the questions that that I was personally  posing to my math my calculus teachers  was when am I ever going to use this you  know and they they came up with some  kind of [ __ ] that it would be  valuable to me future in my life and the  truth is that it really isn't  um and I think high schoolers are very  Savvy about that they they can sort of  understand when you're you're reaching  um so  for me  those things are are not as important  now memory to the internet is an  interesting one  I've sort of resigned about it now I  think that is the general feeling in the  public there are people I mean there are  people who  um who like you can find essays online  uh uh who who argue for rote  memorization as a method of schooling to  come back in a big way you know we we  still do that but we don't do it as much  as we as they used to do in the early  parts of the 20th century and which you  know that was a huge part of of  Education now we actually lean more  towards essays because you know I think  in part we realize that  our access to information  is always with us you know it's it's  never not going to be with us moving  forward  um and so I I don't know for sure if if  we've lost something from not being able  to recall  on the spot things but maybe we have I  don't know what do you think dude I  the the memory wand stuck out at me  because we're just glossing over spell  check by the way we don't need no yeah  no thank God for spell check I know that  was a waste of time uh though yeah I did  spelling bees and all that so you know  whatever  um well you had to when you were like  third fourth grade uh but memory I've  noticed and again I can't tell this is  age or technology but that because I'm  so dependent on oh I'll just Google it  if I need to remember something that  personal memory stories even from not  even from childhood even from like a  couple weeks ago when I'm trying to like  piece together a story to tell friends  uh I have a harder time and I wonder if  it's because like I'm not using the  muscle of memory as nearly as much as I  used to before Google which was you know  probably the first 20 25 years of my  life  well I mean this is I think all gonna  it's all gonna wrap into the  conversation about writing but  you know it might be the case that  like in-person dialogue conversation  dinner party chatter has suffered I  think lots of memory yeah because you  know  if you're alone and you're  trying to compose something on your own  you know then then it doesn't really  matter at what speed you get to the  information but if what we're all  operating on is like a surface level of  things and in order to say something  intelligent about what happened in the  world or like you say three weeks ago in  your own life you know then conversation  could suffer from that  um but you know it's our it's it's too  late it's too late we're never getting  it back  offline is brought to you by  bookshop.org we've all been there that  feeling of existential dread when you're

AI we  should be careful about how much we  Outsource because there's something  special and important and and  fundamentally human about writing  um what is it  so and this this sort of goes back to to  the me of high school which is that  I  really was an uninspired student in high  school  um I  like I said those essays you it just  steaming off of them was this kid who  really would rather have done anything  else but sit down and write this essay  on Pride and Prejudice  um and that's just because you know the  educational system as a whole at least  for me in the sort of middle class  Suburban Philadelphia world  you know I could read the incentives of  the education system and the incentive  said to me that  What mattered wasn't learning it was  grades and that learning was just a  means to achieve the grades which was a  means to achieve the GPA which was a  means to achieve the  the degree the college the job and so on  and that was just that was just me  reading the world around me  um now great teachers can puncture  through that but the system you know the  system as a whole can can corrupt you  know the good intentions of individual  people  it wasn't until I got to college and I  write about this in my book which is  really sort of the theme of you know of  of the book which is that  when I got to college as this uninspired  kid and had completed these checkpoints  I discovered Ralph Waldo Emerson who was  such a huge you know a huge figure for  me in my development and what was so  mind-blowing about Emerson was that  reading him it was like I was reading my  own thoughts and that that just blew my  mind and Emerson has this quote that  that  I I'll never forget which is that the  young man reveres Men of Genius because  to speak truly they are more himself  than he is you know and that is that is  just to say that  you know  language  and this is what I learned I really  learned from Emerson language is what  makes up the human mind you know and the  more sophisticated you can be with  language the better you can understand  yourself others in the world  Emerson taught me that and it launched  in me you know it  it's a sort of hunger to get to the  bottom of myself to answer the questions  I talk about in the video which are who  am I and what are those things that I  believe  um and so that is what writing is you  know  we talk about thinking  we talk about speaking we talk about  writing but they're just different words  for the same thing thinking is writing  speaking is writing and writing is  writing it's just different levels of  sophistication  for the most part the me until I started  writing for myself the me was made up of  the language in my head the language of  thought which is just chaos the language  in your mind is pure chaos and the  language of speech is a little better  but please no one transcribed the things  that I do not transcribe this because  the level of sophistication between what  I am able to extemporaneously say  versus what I'm able to compose in  writing  is the gulf there is huge and so I think  what I learned was that just this  respect for  the ability to compose language and how  really important it is for  self-knowledge and knowledge of the  world  self-knowledge is is especially  interesting there  um it made me think have you heard that  um psychologists and and therapists  often suggest keeping a journal uh to  patients because and the reason they do  that is because the act of writing  apparently integrates our emotional  right brain with our logical left brain  so that instead of lying awake and  spinning out with our thoughts and  emotions uh as you just alluded to like  don't don't transcribe what's going on  in my head we can understand and process  them by using the more logical left  brain to figure out how to channel and  organize those emotions into actual  words on a page and that in itself is  sort of an act of self-realization and  understanding that sort of helps your  own mental health have you heard about  that I I mean I haven't heard that  precisely but it makes complete sense it  makes complete I mean think about what  talk therapy is you know what  Psychotherapy is you know you're being  asked to Artic essentially articulate  the way you feel in language the way you  feel about certain things to a per to a  particularly sensitive listener who can  identify  the patterns the sort of the deleterious  patterns in your own thinking you know  and that's I think that's that's at the  Key of this whole conversation about  Chachi PT and writing is that  the language in our heads or the  language that we we receive from the  world like it doesn't just it doesn't  just form into spontaneous patterns it  takes the patterns of the language that  already exists  you know and so we are all living along  the the grooves of language created by  other people yeah on the most basic  level  we are you know we are living in the  pattern of the syntax and grammar of  language so you know the way language  sentences are put together that that's  really the only way we can think you  know and so that's the most fundamental  thing but then on top of that you have  the conventional wisdom of the culture  and the received knowledge that you get  the ways that your mind analyzes your  the way that you analyze yourself  without even realizing it is a long  sentence structures and you know  persuasive structures forms and genres  of writing that you you have been you  know you you've been exposed to  throughout your life  and the only way to disrupt that is to  create language of your own I think yeah  well so I love the line in the video  um where you say not to write is to live  according to the language of others this  is this is what you were just talking  about  um but just like just to play Devil's  Advocate on this I I happen to agree but  so chat GPT is is living according to  the language of others because it's  basically just a composite of the entire  internet right but isn't what we write  and think a comp a composite of all the  information we've processed  you know like what's the difference  between there is no difference it's just  a matter of degree it's just a matter of  you know that's the thing it's like  the the human mind and  culture are the same thing it's just a  symbolic reality you know it's it's a  symbolic system and the dominant  symbolic system in that reality is  language we have all other kinds of  symbolic systems you know gestures or  images or or architecture or whatever  ways that we read the world but by far  the most dominant one is language and so  we can never Escape  receipt like like I say in the video  like writing is a form of editing as  well because we are receiving we're just  receiving words you know that  Shakespeare made you know or or we're  receiving ways of thinking that that uh  that Virginia wolf wrote you know who  whomever it is and that will always be  the case you can never transcend the  symbolic reality but  Shakespeare and Virginia Woolf and you  have the exact same power to change the  reality that we all live in and a  creative a generative relationship to  language  is I think much more beneficial to  people and to the world than a receipt a  purely received one  um and then there's degrees in that too  you know there's reading tweets and then  there's Reading Virginia Woolf right no  there's a little bit different yeah  exactly so there's writing  um you know a letter to your friend and  then there's attempting you know  attempting to write an essay about  something that means that that means a  lot to you you know just the process of  doing that just bolting words into a  structure of your own  is I think going to be therapeutic on  the personal level on the cultural level  desperately needed desperately  well it's interesting because like I'm  interested I wonder what you think are  sort of the top Hallmarks of really good  writing because I do think that gets to  what humans and individuals can do that  artificial intelligence could probably  never do  I mean I I don't want to say never who  the hell no yeah that's right yeah I'm  that's that's my optimistic uh well  there's there's there's the thing of  like you know they they  there there was a Princeton student like  last week who created a a app that can  detect chat GPT you know to to like you  know ruin all these high schools man  what a night yeah I know that's exactly  what I thought  this is exactly what I said all of his  friends are having fun with Chachi PT  all right I know um but good for him  um and it you know it might be able to  catch like this version of it but you  know it's going to be an arms race you  know yeah the the AI is going to get  better and eventually maybe it can't it  will be able to write something like as  sophisticated as our favorite writers I  don't know I don't want to say never but  I don't know for me the Hallmarks of of  great writing are it's about drilling  into parts of experience  that have not been  articulated yeah you know the the beauty  of Shakespeare  is that  when he wrote Romeo and Juliet what he  essentially did was Define  a a a kind of experience romantic love  that did not really exist in that way  prior and which we are all living still  you know the the shortest definition of  love as we know it in 2022 like like  identity affirming and potentially  identity destroying love is Romeo and  Juliet that's the most succinct  definition of love he brought that into  the culture and that's what genius is  you don't have to be a genius to to to  be a great writer but you know there are  still you know it would be silly to  think that there are there are no more  kinds of experience that have yet to be  articulated in those interesting ways so  when I'm reading  I'm always looking for those people who  who who just essentially turn a light on  to turn a light on something that we  were all sort of  orbiting but couldn't put like that's  the that's why it's so joyful when you  find a writer who just it just like yeah  clicks for you and they've explained  something and all of a sudden your life  comes into Focus I mean that is that is  the the drug that I'm constantly looking  for  when uh so I was I was originally  trained as just a standard political  speechwriter yeah and by the time I  started working for Obama I knew how to  write a standard Democratic political  speech and then when I started working  with him I basically had to unlearn all  of that to figure out how to write in  his voice because he was intent on like  making it personal making it about  himself the reason the 2004 convention  speech did well is because he told the  story that no other politician could  have told the reason dreams from my  father was a a great first book is  because it didn't sound like a  politician was writing it who was going  to run for office so then long after I  left him and would like advise people on  speeches and they say what makes a good  speech  what makes it is uh writing it from your  point of view writing a speech that no  one else could give but you telling a  story that no one else could tell but  you that no one else has heard making a  point that no one else has made before  and you know what people say about good  writing often is like it's not you might  not remember what you heard but um if  it's good you'll remember how you felt  and so there's certain emotion that  writing good writing generates and  that's whether that's you know moving  you emotionally whether it's making you  laugh  Chachi PT doesn't do well with humor  um right and so like there's certain  there's a there's emotion that comes  from writing that I don't know you can  necessarily capture at least if you are  just scraping the internet of language  and and and you know generating a really  smart autocomplete yeah it's interesting  though because how do you write for how  do you write something that only you  could write for someone else the key  there also was like if I  if I had not if I had no contact with  Obama uh if I had to just study him just  read his books read his transcripts of  his interview basically be a chat GPT  yeah yeah and then turn things out I  still I don't think it would have been  all that successful and the other big  thing I tell people is like if you are  the kind of politician whose  speechwriter is like five staffers  removed from you and you're just getting  drafts and editing and sending it back  then like that's not really going to  work like you I I got to know him yeah  and collaborate with him and he did a  lot of the writing himself and I really  think that's the only way you can be  successful because if you're J you can I  could be a really good mimic but I can't  get all the way there because I'm not  you yeah I haven't had your experiences  right and each one of this back to your  point like each one of us what makes us  potentially powerful writers is that we  have had a a unique set of experiences  and relationships that no one else in  the world has had  yeah and you know that just just hearing  you talk about that too it I think it's  it's Salient for the conversation about  like where does the high school essay go  from here  um because  listen I I don't know if I  I don't know what could have convinced  me to really get into it you know at  that age  but what didn't definitely didn't get me  into it was the very sort of dry five  paragraph  argumentative essay that we're all  familiar with from school which is  say what you're going to say  prove it in three different ways and  then say what you just said you know  like and actually that's the kind of  essay that Chachi BT is really good at  at reproducing  um but  you're talking about like if I was if I  was the the 15 year old me and I was  listening to what you just said and  you're saying  only you've lived these experiences and  then you know  if we lean towards the personal  and essentially  you know tell these students that what  you can write is you know unique to you  maybe we will be able to you know  create a love of writing at a younger  age which is really the point of all  this it's right you know it didn't  succeed with me really but what I say in  the um what I say in the video is that  it didn't succeed but the the heroic  work of teachers you know on an insipid  teenager like me was just giving me the  basic competence of  structure and grammar and syntax and  when it came when I was moved to right  you know when it finally hit me when I  when my life felt very shallow and  Confused  I had those fundamentals to to  work with and  um yeah I don't know I I  I have no like answer for the  educational system but great teacher is  an inspiring you know people who can  inspire you I think it's really the only  way to get through yeah and I I don't  think that's why teachers I don't think  could be replaced by uh artificial  intelligence absolutely not or at least  the kind of teaching we're

creative writing right it's an obstacle  in a way of a lot of things yeah right  of course  um one thing I struggled with since I  left the White House especially over the  last five years is that I'm finding it  much more difficult to write uh which  used to be my entire job  um and as I've been doing on this show  I've wondered how much the internet has  to do with it in your uh book of  fantastic essays um and one of them  about the internet you write  when I'm consuming the internet it feels  like the agency dial has been turned to  zero culture isn't just in my mind it's  steering my thinking and as I spend more  time online I'm getting better at  ascertaining the internet's opinions  instead of developing my own I I like  read that and I was like man that is me  um do you do you think that's why it  might be harder to write like right  before that in the essay I go through  this I try to recreate this  hour long period after I saw the cat's  trailer a couple years ago and how so  funny I was just like this weird like  detective trying to figure out what I  should be thinking about this cat's  trailer and people who are online people  you know will I think relate to that  experience of you know  uh of trying to figure out what the  internet's thoughts for us are and it it  goes to I think the same thing we've  been talking about which is that  language is at the core of the human  mind and culture and the Internet is  just an expression of of culture  um and so  I had this professor at Boston  University who who who essentially  taught that taught that to us and one  interesting Coral area of that is that  because the because the mind is really  just language it means that there is no  spatial quality to the mind the mind is  temporal it's it's a function of time  and it happens in sequence and if you  think about thinking you know you  we talk sometimes talk about having two  thoughts at the same time but that's not  really how it works they all come in  sequence and so  what that essentially means is that you  you just have a calendar of time every  day and a number of appointments that  can be filled on that calendar  if you're online all the time  you know what essentially is happening  is  the internet is filling up all those  appointments on your mind's timeline  and Because the Internet especially like  Twitter and a lot of social media is  language itself you know what's  essentially happening is that your mind  is being swapped out for internet mind  you know it's it's not like you can just  if you give away time you are giving  away your mind I mean there's nothing  else to the mind you know and so you you  have to be sort of care and and so and  let me tell you internet mind easy to  spot  yeah yeah  the internet mind is the mind that's  that is spending that is trying to  figure out what the cats trailer is all  about that is internet mind or or in any  number of Realms  um and so  it makes it harder to write  purely because you are not spending any  generative time with language you're  receiving you're just you know  for a lot of it receiving the worst kind  of language you know horrible not not  good for you you know you could be  spending I hope spending some time  reading good articles and things like  that which you know will  have a good effect for you but  what you what we all need to do the only  thing we can do is to step away from it  and allow some language composition of  our own some time for that  um  and just and just like forming our own  opinions I think is is huge too uh  because the way that Echo Chambers are  talked about now it's uh from like a  sort of partisan political perspective  right but I think there's something else  going on there which is sort of having  in your mind your opinions being shaped  by sort of the general cultural opinion  so like I've had embarrassingly I've had  these experiences where I finish a TV  show or I finish a movie and I almost  want to tweet about how great it is but  before I do that I will check Twitter  dude to be like well I don't want to  step into something horrible and say  that something I loved and everyone's  gonna be like what the [ __ ] that's  horrible you're canceled speaking to me  so much right now I can't even tell you  and then but then I've also done like  I've watched speeches like political  speeches and I did this I tried to do  Twitter wasn't as crazy during the Obama  years as it is now but I've done this a  few times where I'm like okay President  Biden's giving a speech or back with  President Trump was giving speech or  anyone's giving a speech and I'm like  you know what instead of watching the  speech while I am scrolling through  Twitter I want to just because I'm going  to talk about this on the pot I want to  just watch it and and react to it what I  think of the speech what is it what do  you think right but that's the problem  that I'm like at least I can compare it  to what's happening online but I want to  have my own opinion first and I think  that the reason I've had so much trouble  writing is because every time I'm trying  to like figure out a take on something  it is just a a composite of the various  takes that I have seen on the internet  and I'm sitting there I'm like well I  don't want to write it unless it's  something new or something that I have  to say that no one else has said yet  otherwise what's my point yeah I mean  you're speaking you're just really  speaking to my heart right now I mean I  don't envy you  because you have  needs for takes on a much broader  variety of things and much more a much  bigger number of takes you know for me  like I have come to terms with the fact  that on a lot of things I'd say probably  the vast majority of things I don't have  an opinion  and that's okay you know because  because the question is what's the  quality of the opinion I have these 10  essays that I wrote In the book I  release a nerdwriter video once a month  or something you know  that is essentially that is the that  comprises that's a prolific number of  takes yeah  I mean like the the 10 essays in the  book per se the 11 essays in the book  like  those are original ideas and opinions  that I each on each of them spent at  least a month trying to think through  what I actually think about this because  they meant a lot to me  um and  because I like you're saying like you  want to say something that people  haven't said before that you feel has  value that's unique to you those are the  things that I feel have value for me and  I and one of the reasons I really don't  post like on Twitter or other social  media is because I just don't really  feel comfortable  opining on everything  you know it's yeah essentially or or  just that like I don't really know what  my opinion is  um and we do live in a culture in which  you are asked to Give opinions on  everything yeah um and I well on Twitter  you can like you can watch it in real  time you're like oh yeah all the covet  experts just became Ukraine experts  there we go a lot of overlap in that but  I totally struggle with you I won like  one realm is music you know like I I I  have an issue where like and I don't  know how what to do about it but when I  listened to an album  I go on Pitchfork to see what  they said about it and like I really  wish that that didn't affect me but if  the if the rating is below a seven that  has that that is going to be a real  difficult you know it's like I I try to  divorce myself from those things yeah  but you know it  and I think it partly comes from the  fact that like  we are bombarded now with so much more  information on such a wider variety of  things than we ever have before that as  a shorthand we have to rely on the  opinions of others for a lot of things  you know we have to not only you know  trust in experts who are smarter than us  or have spent time with because we can't  possibly do that kind of work ourselves  but you know when um you're at a dinner  party and someone's asking about you  know  the House of Representatives  this latest bill or that you know you  it's not the worst thing in the world if  if you parrot a talking point that you  heard if it you know if it actually  has some resonance with you  um you're not going to be able to get  away with a like unique incisive like  totally unique opinion on everything you  come across  um and so we're in this weird position  and the internet is is  certainly making it more difficult if  not just worse I interviewed Johann Hari  last week who wrote the book stolen  Focus which is a book about paying  attention to things he writes at length  about sort of letting your mind wander  the benefits of letting your mind wander  um you you write about this too you call  it free time time for ideation  um  how did you come around to realizing  that you weren't doing enough of that  and what's your what's your process now  um wow definitely don't have a process  is a mess over here  no because that that essay the internet  essay too like it ends on a very  pessimistic note with like this  backsliding that happens which I think  we're all familiar with of like setting  up these these boundaries for yourself  where you're being really good about and  then slowly those things coming back  into your life until you're it's worse  than it was at the start  um I think the way I sort of came to  that was like  I am a constant input for things  whether it's the internet or other forms  of media and it was really just one day  in the shower realizing like this is the  only time of the day like my mind is  wandering I'm in the shower there's  nothing else yeah I'm not an input for  anything and you come up with some good  ideas you you like go places you didn't  think you would go  um and so  I tried to build that time into my life  you know tried to build some time just  to sit down and do nothing but you know  what I say in the book is that like  it's not easy  primarily because  the distractions of the internet the  time that you're being an input is like  the perfect kind of thing to  to  distract from the self-criticisms of  your own mind you know and so the very  first things that are going to come to  you when you build some free time are  those things yeah um and then you  remember oh yeah that's the reason why I  was on Tick Tock for 30 hours because  yes I'm trying to distract myself from  existential angst there was a purpose  yeah yeah exactly  um let's let's reopen  um but uh  if you can  get through that and it's sort of like  quitting sugar or quitting something you  know the first week is just going to be  hell  but eventually you will you know you  will be able to get to a place where you  are more comfortable with that feeling  and letting your mind sort of do its  thing with language like we've been  talking about will yield I think  um  interesting creative therapeutic results  um but again you know I I I I I have  it's it's a roller coaster you know I  just yeah a couple days ago I put the I  put the stupid freaking time the things  on the apps you know at the time yeah  and  I have over I've overrode them every  single day I know I know the same thing  it's like sometimes it pauses me when  the when the you've your Twitter time is  up and it's like 8am  okay I've been up since five and uh yeah  that's a problem but it's really hard  and I think the reason it's hard is  because it's not I mean the reason we  don't call these uh devices addictive  lightly here like it's not always up to  us I mean like when we are exposed to  them when they're around and when it is  sort of permeating the entire society  that we're in  um it's hard it's hard to put them down  one thing that helps is is reading books  I mean that that to me is like and  my wife actually turned me on to to  um reading  like reading and listening at the same  time so audiobook book at the same time  and that that puts me into like a kind  of hyper focus it just keeps me on like  the train tracks you know  um  and  again goes right back to language like  being exposed to  long-form text from a good writer is you  know is a really  therapeutic  creative thing to experience I talk  about I talk about it like it's so like  it's something from the distant past or  something you know it kind of is that's  how I feel like I I finished a novel in  July on vacation and I was like this  vacation was so restful and and  restorative and I feel great and I read  this novel everyone's like yeah who the  [ __ ] do you think I wrote him novel you  know I'm like but I read this and it  made me feel so good it's like you know  that's that's what you're that's what a  lot of us are missing  um try the try the headphones in the  book I'm gonna try this I like this  um Evan pushak thank you so much uh for  joining uh go to uh go to Evan's YouTube  channel uh which
