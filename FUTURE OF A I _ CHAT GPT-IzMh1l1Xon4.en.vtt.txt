 one major Trend will be an increased  focus on artificial intelligence I  [Music]  I is a form of computing that seeks to  create machines that can think learn and  respond intelligently to complex  situations  as I Technologies become more advanced  they could help us automate repetitive  tasks and make decisions at speeds and  scales not achievable by humans  I also holds promise in areas as diverse  as Healthcare education and crime  another major development in it is the  proliferation of The Internet of Things  ayat  I is a network of connected devices that  can collect and exchange data without  the need for human intervention  [Music]  this could result in new opportunities  to Monitor and control devices remotely  such as home security systems and  automated vehicles  [Music]  the advances in cloud computing will  also continue to shape the future of it  [Music]  cloud computing allows us to store and  manage large volumes of data online  saving businesses time money and  resources  [Music]  this growth in cloud computing will also  be vital to providing support for new  technologies such as ion diet  finally blockchain technology could also  have a major impact on the future of it  blockchain is a secure distributed  Ledger that allows secure and immutable  making it an ideal solution for storing  data securely  blockchains could be used to create a  secure

Hyatt cloud computing and blockchain  likely to shape our lives in the coming  years  [Music]  it's an exciting time to be in a  professional as new technologies are  created tested and implemented  in recent years countries around the  world have begun to race towards the  Forefront of Information Technology it  this is an area of significant  importance for any nation that wishes to  remain competitive in the global economy  as well as for those wishing to remain  secure from cyber threats and attacks  governments have taken several steps to  ensure that their citizens are equipped  with the skills and resources needed to  stay ahead in the at race  [Music]  thank you One Way countries have  achieved this is through the advancement  of educational initiatives in areas such  as computer science and coding  [Music]  additionally tech companies have been  encouraged and incentivized to in their  own country and establish research and  development centers  [Music]  the governments of some countries have  also established cyber security  strategies and protocols that help  protect citizens data infrastructure and  networks  the result is an increased focus on  internet security and privacy with laws  being passed to better protect users  information and to ensure a safe and  secure online environment  [Music]  as technology advances in new ways to  use it are discovered it is clear that  the future of it will remain an  important and ever-evolving Topic in  economic and political discussions  [Music]  governments must continue to invest in  both educational and security  initiatives if they wish to remain ahead  of the curve in terms of it  [Music]  by doing so they can ensure that their  citizens have the skills and resources  necessary
