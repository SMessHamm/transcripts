 we live in a world of knockoffs and  copycats and generic versions most of  the stuff we see is already that it's  just that it takes us longer to get  there so we think it has more value as  if by some reason the time you take to  come up with something means it's more  valuable than this calculator that can  spit it out instantly will stop allowing  for the generic drivel that's online to  be acceptable as standard so if you can  get a marketing plan or a business plan  written for you in two seconds how  valuable is that the point was it never  was valuable so many of these standards  have been put in place with Gatekeepers  that have used strange language or meta  difficult or said it's complex and  there's been these lies around certain  things that should have been  democratized and accessible and  available to everyone and the barriers  have been your time and money a  convoluted language which really comes  from as I always say outdated  patriarchal structures that were just  old white rich men who wanted to keep  knowledge for themselves and now that  doesn't exist
