 hi guys welcome back to another  interesting video and today  um  it's all about tech  so I bet most of you have come across  this system chat GPT and for those who  don't know  chat GPT is chat generative pre-trained  Transformer  um it's a prototype or rather a chatbot  which is designed to generate  conversations which are human-like and  they appear so natural that you can  hardly notice the difference  so  out of curiosity I also decided to check  it out and I must say  it has some exciting features about it  so in the process I decided to check out  some of the jobs which are likely to  fill the change or even  be replaced who knows so yeah I'll be  using the system to show you guys I'll  be um putting illustrations on how  um this system can do the jobs that I'm  going to show you here so I came up with  around four jobs that you know I feel  like  um this system can to some extent do the  same work  so let's just get into it  um  so the first job that I decided to look  okay just um  clear information I actually went Google  the jobs here I prompted to let's just  see  [Music]  Japan  [Music]  [Music]  [Music]  foreign  [Music]  likely to replace and it gave me a  couple of  answers there there are around five of  them the person is customer service and  support  which is majorly responding to frequency  questions by customers  and then there is data entry and  management then content generation  translation translating one language to  another  and then we also have marketing and  advertising  yeah so those are just some of the five  um answers that the system gave me  um so I went ahead and dig deeper and  these are some of the  uh jobs that I came up with so the first  job that I came across was copywriting  so under copywriting for those  copywriting is more or less like  marketing and advertising because a  company will always hire a copywriter to  create content which are persuasive  enough  to tell us why we should get this  product and not the other product so  that is basically what a copywriter does  so let's see what  the system can generate for us so I'm  going to advertise  I want content on  seo seo is a cool used in content  writing and SEO  [Music]  sorry that's just  [Music]  [Music]  yeah and and that's it you can see it  has given me  all the content so it's it fast gives  the introduction and then a few points  on it but then yeah the conclusion so  for a copywriter I think if he or she  looks at this then it is something and  remember here  um it stated it is important to note  that AI is not necessarily replacing  jobs but rather changing the task and  responsibility within jobs so this is  just giving you  um something to start with  yes it is not a copy and paste situation  so it is it is something rather than if  you are at zero then you are at a  certain percentage and if if if whatever  you you're looking to  put inside your content is rather almost  the same as this then at least you're  not at zero so yeah for for a copywriter  maybe he'll he or she will find  um more content on  um give us wise you know why we should  use this at least add some information  on it and yeah that's it for copywriting  so  let's move to the second  job that I also found out that is  content writing content writing  basically is almost the same actually  it's the same thing content generation  which is mainly writing articles reports  and other forms of content based on  prompts  yes so let's see what the system can do  because  [Music]  it can complete it says with  introductions even have the body and  even conclusion so let's just prompt it  to do this for us so I'm going to write  give me a title  [Music]  [Music]  the five titles in some cases I'm in  content writing one is normally just  given a few hints and here she is told  to come up with titles uh for the  article so yeah I just got my five  titles and if you go through them and  you feel like that is what you want to  work with then yeah it's it was good as  new and let's just do another one  okay  right  [Music]  proposal  remember this is some of the things that  concentrators do I bet some of them are  even already using the system write a  proposal  [Music]  it has even given me a title study on  the impact of covid-19  here  and then we have the introduction  [Music]  the objectives of The Proposal  the methods to be used  data analysis  and even expected outcomes that is a  proposal  and then you have a question  so  I would say that it is not  100 percent but at least it's something  and it's only a matter of time to  know what this thing even be more  capable of doing so yeah that is that is  that  it has given me all it is a proposal of  a study on the impact of covid-19 on  mental health and yeah we have something  so this is just something you can start  with or you can start working with in  case you don't know where to start from  the next the next job which is  customer support customer support it's  also the same as  uh let's see  um customer service and support here  which is responding to frequently asked  questions and providing information and  this is mainly through email feedback  so let's let's just do one let's just  try and do one let's let's use this  system as the customer support  yes  so an example I'm going to prompt it to  write  customers  [Music]  [Music]  [Music]  [Music]  [Music]  so that is the subject  and then dear Ben thank you for reaching  out  it is so natural because even empathetic  uh I am sorry to hear that you're  encountering  yes so those are some of the details  yeah so they are this subject help with  my m-pesa payment issue  oh  on to the next and the last  job is programming and  programmers this is basically I'm using  some code it it's it entails some code  and  um  there are some formulas that you have to  use to create  something yes so  all right  icon but this is  order the programming  you can hold  there's also JavaScript  so I want to create a linked list all  right if I don't hold four  breathing and Link it for someone who  was creating a link list and it has it  has taken off  um you know some coding tasks some  tedious because I hear you have to  create and you have to come up with this  formula just to create everything so  foreign  list is good to go so yeah so that's it  so I think when it comes to programming  those with the vast knowledge on  programming called  CPT as an opportunity to present some of  their tedious according tasks  unless for the entry level programming  positions which might feel you know  threatened by these  but  the question is  is the system a threat or an opportunity  well  but it's still  a puzzle  and it's only a wait and see  what's this  system can do  I have shown you just a few of what it  can do  and it is amazing it is it is just it is  a new thing  it isn't I would say it doesn't take off  it doesn't do the work a hundred percent  but it cuts to some percentage but also  remember  it is um it can give a biased  information or even  um and an information that is not true  so  it is only someone who understands  whatever they're working on that I'm he  or she will know whether the information  provided here is true or false so yeah  at the end of the day you'll always have  to go and check it out even more and  even add more information  so  all in all that was it  so  um  what I can say is I hope you found the  video have helpful enough and  interesting so those are some of the  jobs that I came up that that I  um  did my due diligence and  that's just my opinion  and for me  um I think I'm loving this system it is  is an interesting one  to learn from if you found the video  interesting kindly subscribe for more  videos yeah like share and leave a  comment if you have a question  [Music]
