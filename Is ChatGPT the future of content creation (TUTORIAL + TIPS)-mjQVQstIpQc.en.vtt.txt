 I've just spent the last few days  testing out chap GPT as a Content  creation tool and my mind is blown I've  already been able to use it to write  blog posts Instagram posts Instagram  prompts website SEO descriptions and  much more all automatically in this  video I'm going to show you how to do  this as well and how this is potentially  going to change content creation forever  but I also wanted to share with you some  of its limitations and things to  consider if you are going to use it in  your marketing as well so if you haven't  heard of it already chap GPT is an AI  chat bot that you can basically ask any  question to or have conversations with  and it will generate human-like answers  pretty much instantly using data from  all across the internet and training as  well it's currently free to use up to a  certain point and it feels like everyone  on the Internet is talking about it  right now so I actually hadn't been able  to access it for a good few days because  their servers were overloaded but I've  been able to use it over the last couple  of days I hope it doesn't do the same  thing to you but just something to bear  in mind in terms of what it can do it's  basically like having a virtual  assistant so you can ask it questions  you can get it to do research for you  you can get it to write content for you  and you can even use it to generate code  or images as well all based off a prompt  or a question that you ask it so once  you start using it you'll realize how  insaneness actually is but you might  have to sign up for a free account on  open Ai and then you basically just can  type in to this little box down here  what you want it to generate for you or  a question so I'm just going to type in  a quick prompt in here to show you and  so that you can see how basically  instantly it manages to generate a piece  of content  okay so as you can see I just typed in  that short prompt you can actually make  it as detailed as you like and it has  generated this 500 word blog post for me  within less than a minute and the crazy  thing about this is that it is AI it's  artificial intelligence so it's not just  copying and pasting this from Wikipedia  it's using data from all across the web  to write something in a human-like voice  and language because it's actually a  language processing tool so it's  constantly learning and phrasing things  in its own way so this is more of just  kind of like a long paragraph style blog  post but in another example I asked it  to write an 800 word blog post about the  best email marketing tips for Creative  business owners in 2023 and it wrote  this out with more of like a listical  style blog post so it does create kind  of different formats as well of content  and if you actually sit down and read  what it comes up with it is mind-blowing  how accurate and good it is at the  English language grammar and everything  like that I'm going to talk about some  nuances and limitations in a minute but  just as a first reaction it is crazy and  I've tested this with loads of different  topics different types of content  there's so much you can do with it so  yeah the first reaction when you use  this tool is basically like wow this is  incredible this is so cool but then it  starts to sink in and your next reaction  is probably something along the lines of  wow this could really mess stuff up in  the world of content creation and for  SEO going to put people out of jobs  what's the point of being a content  creator anymore how's this going to work  with Google ranking things if everyone's  just going to pump out blog posts using  this tool so I have some thoughts and  some things that I've noticed after  using it over the last couple of days so  with regards to SEO it's really  important to remember that Google is a  massive company with very sophisticated  algorithms and whilst it might be  freaking out right now and might not  have caught up with the technology just  yet I imagine that at Google right now  they are working on a way for that  algorithm to be able to tell what has  been created by AI they've probably  already figured this out but just need  to make it a bit more sophisticated even  before this whole thing came out it's  very common for people to create  websites that are just full of content  that's been written up very quickly and  is purely focused on SEO and Google  notices that it knows when people are  trying to cheat the system and it's only  going to get more sophisticated the  second thing that comes to mind is is  there going to be issues with plagiarism  with this chat bot and the content that  it's producing and obviously it's AI so  technically the content that it's  creating it's not just copy and pasted  from anywhere it has actually been  generated as new content and apparently  people have been testing it and it does  tend to rank quite low on the plagiarism  scale but it's not perfect and there is  still a risk there that some parts of  the text that is being generated could  be plagiarized from various sources from  around the web there's also techno  apology being created right now that is  going to potentially be able to put  what's called a cryptographic watermark  on the content that is created by AI so  that things like the Google algorithm  and plagiarism tools for exams and  research and things like that might be  able to pick up on and things like  copyright laws will eventually catch up  right now the technology is moving too  fast for the laws to keep up so who  knows what that is going to look like  eventually but I would certainly avoid  just copying and pasting any of the  content that this thing creates and  calling it your own work without  customizing it or editing it the other  thing to note is that it is not perfect  it's pretty close but it's not a hundred  percent perfect if you're asking it to  create content about very broad topics  that everyone kind of knows about it's  gonna probably do quite well but there's  no real point in creating that kind of  content because it's probably already  been done a million times and now people  are able to use this tool so if you want  to use it to create content about very  specific niches for example writing a  blog post about the town of Falmouth  which is a very small town it's a very  specific Niche to be writing about it's  going to create a really great piece of  content for you but you are still going  to want to fact check it I've been  testing it out with various different  topics and some of it did come back with  things that were incorrect or just  weren't quite right so some intimate  knowledge is still required if you're  going to be creating content around  specific niches for example yesterday I  asked it to write me a blog post about  the best paddle boarding spots in  Cornwall now most of the suggestions  that it generated were fine and  definitely something that I would  recommend as well as someone who lives  in Cornwall and has that knowledge but  one of the suggestions it gave me  definitely would not be a spot that I  would recommend because it would  actually be too wavy for you to go  paddle boarding on and that kind of very  specific local knowledge is something  that I have but I wouldn't necessarily  expect anyone from a different location  to know that and I wouldn't expect an AI  robot to know that either so definitely  very location specific stuff or things  that are slightly subjective or opinion  based the content is not going to be  perfect for this but also I asked it to  write a blog post about email marketing  using a tool called flodesk and this is  a topic that I specialize in in terms of  knowledge I have a whole course about  how to use flow desk but it's a very  Niche tool and it's actually quite  recent in terms of how long it's been  around for and one of the tips or facts  that the chat GPT generated for this was  actually wrong it said that in flow desk  you can use an A B testing feature which  flowdest doesn't have yet but if you  were a human wanting to write a good SEO  post about flowdesk having never used it  but trying to use your own research you  would probably make that same mistake  too and this is where it's important for  you to make sure you're inputting your  own specific Niche knowledge into these  pieces of content as well so overall I  would say Do not just copy and paste  this and use it on your blog and your  website without customizing or editing  how I would suggest to use it would be  to use it for creating prompts it's  great if you don't have any idea about  what kinds of content to post or you  need some idea for like the subheadings  to include within your blog posts you  can definitely use the content that it  produces as a foundation and a starting  point but then what you're going to want  to do is go in and edit it tailor it use  your own brand tone of voice with it and  add in a bit more personality so overall  what do I think this means for the  future of content creation this is a  fairly new tool so it's really hard to  know it's hard to know how Google is  going to respond it's hard to know how  copyright laws are going to respond but  for now it does look like it's going to  mean that everyone and anyone is going  to be able to pump out well-researched  pieces of content for all sorts of  different platforms and that is both a  massive Pro if you are someone who needs  help with your content creation process  but it can be scary if that is part of  your livelihood however if you make sure  that you are actually editing it and  just using it as a jumping off point and  adding in the nuances of the topics that  that you know about then that's going to  be really key another thing that I think  it's going to mean is that personality  is going to be more important than ever  in the way that you write content in  your brand messaging in the way that you  show up online as a business owner using  personal stories anecdotes insights is  going to make your content stand out the  most so it's going to be really  important to develop your own brand tone  of voice and really work on being a  personal Storyteller and injecting some  of yourself into each piece of content  that you create you obviously want to be  unique and have people want to read your  content specifically rather than just  any content that any old AI robot has  created after using it a few times  myself it definitely gave me trust  issues as I was browsing the web looking  at other articles and thinking was this  actually written by a human or was it  written by Ai and if it's written by AI  do I actually trust that it's accurate  now knowing what I know and I have  always wondered this about some sites  that just pump out SEO focused content  where they have researchers who possibly  don't actually have the knowledge  themselves and so miss out the nuances  of certain topics so I think what it's  also going to mean is that trust is  really important and developing a  community of people who trust you and  what you have to say about certain  topics and your own unique perspectives  also of course this is all kind of about  written content technically AI can also  create images as well so if you're  really going to extrapolate that it does  mean that of course video content is  here to stay it's the best way to get  across your brand and your personality  because currently it can't be faked by  AI so I hope you found this video  interesting definitely let me know in  the comments what your thoughts are on  chat gbt and what you've used it for so  far thanks so much for watching and I'll  be back again soon with another video  foreign
