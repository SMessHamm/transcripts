 foreign  called chat GPD was released recently  and it is taking the Internet by storm  it is a hot new sensation in the tech  world and to understand more about it  and the different use cases and the  limitations I spoke to Dennis Dubrow a  good friend of mine and a colleague  Dennis is extremely knowledgeable in the  AI space and he shared some interesting  insights about chat GPT I hope you enjoy  our conversation hey Dennis welcome to  my show thanks for taking time first of  all  um let's start with a little bit of an  intervention tell me a little bit about  yourself hi I'm project manager at  Informatica focusing on MDM okay so this  whole chat GPD is a hype right now it's  a big sensation uh I'm reading a lot I  know you're doing a lot of reading too  so tell me a little bit about chat GPD  what's going on here yeah there is a lot  of hype obviously there and there's  everybody talking about it  the most important thing if you look at  the essential  simplified architecture of it it's  nothing  better than autocomplete really  sophisticated version of the complete  with a lot of the parameters which the  more parameters you add the more complex  patterns you can detect on the data and  the more  more stuff you can generate which looks  like a reasoning which is actually not  reasoning it's just prediction of the  next word in the sequence of the next  word next word and next word so one way  to simplify it I think we talked about  this is predicting the next word which  comes out of it just like how we do it  in text message right so is that a fair  thing too yes yeah okay that makes it a  lot more easier for me someone like me  with the with a less great sales in him  so next let's talk about use cases so  what are some of the use cases that that  you see yeah let's talk about use cases  so essentially it can provide a lot of  power tools to help to automate a lot of  small things in a lot of vertical use  cases so if we look at productivity  improvements or the workflow of many  minitas you know we got a lot of  advancements in image processing  generation of images text generation  classification finding similarities  translation but when we specifically  focus on MDM  you can learn from the human interaction  and optimize many tasks like hey this  task following the same pattern do you  want to complete them because you just  completed similar tasks or you can  organize data by the new patterns  um use use it to generate descriptions  based on the attributes label data sort  of like there's a lot of opportunities  there yeah that's amazing so because I  write a lot of content right someone  like me if I can get a draft content  from chat GPT which obviously I need to  optimize further let's talk a little bit  about limitations okay so what are some  of the limitations of it today as we  stand you know where are we going from  there yeah so when we think when you  think about the limitations you have to  remember the fundamentals so as I was  saying in the beginning this is after  complete but much more sophisticated  version of aftercomplete so you cannot  reason it can only  synthesize based on the data or patterns  is observed in before the other thing is  it's not cheap to run you got to train  it you got to find you on the model for  your specific use case that means not  just compute it's engineering resources  data duration validation so it's not 100  ready for production using a lot of the  use cases you have to figure out you  have to fine tune you have to validate  and this is not cheap absolutely the  part especially where it's not going to  take my job away right away is actually  assuring so thanks for that  um so let's talk a little bit about the  future of where we're going from here  because we suddenly saw this explosion  of innovation in AI right we were we  both were trying this lens AI too which  really took 20 of our pictures and  transformed us into some cool characters  from like five movie so we are really  we're entering this new world so what's  the future of this with chat GPT lens Ai  and all these innovations that are  happening in the AI world uh what do you  see that it's optimistic and pessimistic  point of view optimists are saying like  oh we are like one year away from  exponential growth and getting to  Advanced versions of the AI and PCs are  saying like look at the self-driving car  20 years ago 10 years ago like waiting  now just uh one company released in  production so we don't know but it's  definitely going to take a lot of the  routine tasks and help us in a short  term in the next year next couple of  years will be changing the playground  for businesses for individuals they will  be much more startups who will be  investing into like niche  vertical solving specific use case but  again we got to be really careful  expecting this thing to be production  quality it's experimental still so like  we have to learn a lot and invest a lot  of time absolutely I mean I think I  think this is very interesting space for  me  um and so that's for you um I'm looking  forward to having a lot more  conversations around this right I think  this is a really good intro into chat  GPD and kind of the possibilities there  I want to come back to you later and we  do another version of this okay sure so  um but for now this is great Insight  thanks so much for your time yeah thank  you thanks brush uh happy to be here I'm  happy to share more in the future
