 today's video I'm going to go through  seven different ways that you can use  chat GPT when it comes to making money  with an online business some of the  methods I'm going to discuss in today's  video I've personally used them myself  and it's helped me with various  different elements of my own online  business and as you can see right here  from one of my PayPal accounts I've been  able to bring in over 50 000 pounds in  the last couple months which is maybe  around sixty thousand dollars just by  understanding how to utilize the power  of this new AI bot so as always I don't  waste any more time I want to get right  into it if you find any value in the  video at any point don't forget to press  the like button I really appreciate that  thank you so much don't forget to  subscribe hit the Bell notification so  that YouTube can let you know when a new  video has been released let's not waste  any more time let's get right into it  alright so one of the first ways that  you can utilize chat GPT when it comes  to helping you make money online  specifically when it comes to helping  you find a winning Drop Shipping product  to sell so the way that it works is that  you can log into your chat GPT account  and as you can see over here I've  started a new chat and I asked it what  are the top 10 most popular e-commerce  categories then came back with these 10  different categories that it believes  are the best ones I didn't ask that what  are the top 10 e-commerce products to  sell within the electronics category  because that was number two on the list  and then it then came back with all of  these popular products over here and  using chat GPT it's now given me an idea  of what product I may want to do a  little bit more research into so for  example if I was to copy heart rate  monitors just like that and go over to a  product research software and in this  case I'm going to use Zeke analytics I'm  going to Simply paste it in just like  that and click on search and straight  away according to Zeke analytics is  showing us that over 56 000 pounds was  spent on the specific keyword in the  last 30 days which is maybe around sixty  five thousand dollars and we can also  see the average of the people that are  selling this particular product on eBay  UK at the moment 71 of them were  successful in making a sell and of  course if you want to get a better idea  of exactly which type of heart rate  monitor you want to sell you could just  scroll down on seek analytics and get a  better idea so if I was to click into  this one over here as we can see over 25  individual units has been sold of this  particular heart rate monitor in the  last 24 hours and over 1 265 units has  been sold in total and if you did want  to find this product you're going to be  able to go over to websites like  alibaba.com CJ dropshipping AliExpress  if you did want to sell it yourself  alright so swiftly moving on to the  second way that you can use chat GPT  when it comes to helping you with your  online business is to ask it to help you  find a winning affiliate product to  promote and the way that this works is  very simple as you can see over here I  asked it can you give me 10 ideas for an  affiliate product I can promote on my  blog website that's about running an  online business and if you guys don't  know I've got my own blog over here  successforbusiness.com that's all about  helping people understand the world of  stone and online business so if I wanted  to add a new article I'm going to be  able to find which affiliate products  are the best ones for me to put on my  website and as you guys can see over  here it's now giving me 10 different  ideas of very Stefan affiliate products  I can promote whether it's web hosting  services website Builders email  marketing Services project management  tools I'm going to be able to now get an  idea of all of these different companies  that I'm going to be able to go and find  affiliate links for so number four in  the list we can see email marketing  services so I then asked it to give me  the top 10 email marketing softwares in  this opinion and that's exactly what it  did companies like MailChimp aweber get  response convertkit etc etc and then  from this point it's not going to be a  simple case of me going on to affiliate  marketplaces such as partner stack  impact.com and other ones and then  finding the affiliate programs that I'm  now going to be able to sign up to which  now brings me on to the third way that  you can use this AI tool to help you  make money online which is by asking it  to help you write a blog article so I've  continued the chat over here and I've  asked it to summarize the top 10 email  marketing softwares and I also asked it  to write me a 100 word summary for each  and every software in the list so I did  that for every single one then what I  did is copied and pasted all of these  different summaries into a Word document  made sure to double check the spelling  made sure to double check the grammar  and I also made sure to change some  words around some sentences around and  put it in my own words and once I  confirm that the work is unique and I'm  happy with it I've now started to  publish the article on the back end of  my blog website so as you guys can see  over here the top 10 email marketing  softwares to use in 2023 I haven't  uploaded it to my website as of yet  because I'm still going through some  things I'm still waiting for me to be  accepted for a lot of these different  affiliate programs but as you guys can  see this is what the article is going to  look like if I just click on preview  over here and click on this option once  I finish working on this article this is  what it's going to look like and then  from that point it's going to be a case  of me making sure that I do a finger my  power to rank in the Google search  results so that whenever someone  searches for this particular search term  I'm going to be able to put myself in a  position of being able to make affiliate  commissions from all of these different  softwares alright so moving on to the  next way that you can use this powerful  tool to help you start making money  online is with ClickBank affiliate  marketing but you're going to  specifically use chat GPT when it comes  to helping you create a lead magnet so  the way that this entire process works  is that you're going to produce short  form content long form content it  doesn't really matter but you're going  to produce content on a regular basis on  any platform that you're comfortable  with from there you're going to be able  to attract potential customers with your  lead magnet and then you're going to  send those people from your your lead  magnet to a ClickBank affiliate offer  and then from there you're going to now  be able to make affiliate commissions  alright so I've just logged into my  ClickBank account and I'm going to show  you exactly how you can find a product  to promote and I'm also going to show  you exactly what you need to do when it  comes to using chat GPT to help you  create your lead magnet so first things  first what you need to do is pick a  category at the top right here so I'm  going to click on ebusiness and  e-marketing then what you need to do is  sort the results from Gravity high to  low and from here it's now going to show  you all of the popular affiliate offers  that a lot of affiliate marketers are  having success with right now as we  speak so we can see that this one at the  top has the highest gravity score but  the amount of commissions that you're  going to make is not that much however  there's this one over here that's 53  which is the second best performing  product but if we just scroll down  slightly we can see that there's this  product over here that doesn't  necessarily have the highest gravity  score but we can see that the commission  is going to be 256 dollars for every  single person that you're able to get to  sign up to this particular product But  whichever one that you decide to promote  you just need to go through the process  of getting your affiliate link once  you've got that you then need to go back  to chat GPT and as you can see I've  started a new chat where I asked it what  are the best lead magnets for affiliate  marketing and it was able to give me all  of these different ideas for example a  free trial maybe an ebook you know a  webinar maybe a coupon or discount but I  believe that the best lead magnet that  this one is going to be able to help me  with is by writing an ebook so I started  a brand new chat and I said can you  write an ebook for me and then it said  that it's going to be able to do it I  then asked it to write me an ebook about  starting an online business from there I  was able to give me the basic outline  for the entire ebook and from there it  was a simple case of me asking it to  write me 500 words in each and every  different chapter that it previously  gave me and of course you don't need to  go through the process of copying it  from here into a Word document making  sure that everything's okay checking the  spelling saving as a PDF document and  after you've gone through that entire  process if you now wanted to get your  ebook cover you're going to be able to  use canva because they've got so many  different templates that you're going to  be able to choose from and whichever one  that you do decide to choose you're  going to be able to change the text  you're going to be able to move things  around you're going to be able to delete  any images that you want to and from  there of course you now need to do the  work of producing the content but now  you've got some sort of a lead magnet to  get people onto your email list so that  you're now going to have a chance of  being able to make affiliate commissions  if you did want to use ClickBank and  moving on to one of the final ways that  you're going to be able to make money  online with chat GPT that I'm going to  discuss in this video is by using it to  help you with a faceless YouTube channel  so if you're someone that wants to make  money with a YouTube channel but you  don't necessarily want to sit down every  day and show your face on camera like  what I'm doing right now then you're  going to be able to do it because  there's thousands of different people  out there right now that are able to  make a passive income from their YouTube  channels by never ever even showing  their face and in some cases never using  their own voice and this AI bot is going  to be able to help you with so many  different elements of making money with  a faceless YouTube channel so as you  guys can see over here I started a new  chat where I asked it what are the top  10 high CPM niches on YouTube that do  not require me to show my face it then  came back with these top 10 different  categories things like technology and  gadgets gaming tutorials and how to but  one of the categories over here is food  and cooking and I then said can you give  me 10 faceless YouTube video ideas about  food and then I came back and said sure  and did exactly what I asked it to do  and scrolling down a little bit further  I then asked it to give me an eight  minute video YouTube script for the top  10 best budget friendly meal ideas and  within a few seconds it then came back  with the entire YouTube script exactly  when I need to say how long I need to  say it for word for word everything that  needs to be said in the YouTube video it  was able to give me everything in a  matter of maybe 10 seconds or so now of  course from this point you are gonna  have to make the video and there's an  entire process that goes into it there's  various different AI tools and softwares  that you can use to make videos on a  daily basis that again doesn't even  require you to use your own voice and  I'm currently working on that video  right now as we speak but if you want me  to release that video as soon as  possible then put in the comments down  below do the faceless YouTube video and  I'll get on to that ASAP and if you want  to watch another YouTube video that I  made not too long ago where I break down  the seven ways that you're going to be  able to make money online without ever
