 hello hello hello welcome now stock  trade so in this video we're gonna go  just do a surface level analysis to  basically bring this to discussion so  folks on on our subscriber basis and  also on our private stock terminal can  you know start talking about this and  you know raise it up as a discussion  because I think that uh you know if you  didn't believe in the artificial  intelligence movement in the AI movement  or the fourth Industrial Revolution then  I hope that you know with your  experimentation of chat GPT if you  haven't done so create an account and do  uh you know do talk to this AI  from it's an open source AI from openai  here uh then I recommend you do so  because you'll understand  how important AI is  um you know for the next you know 40 to  50 to 100 years and you know until the  next uh advancements that we have in our  society uh so just very quickly just to  set the tone I think it's important I I  believe I I retweeted this  um  yes here so Microsoft co-founder Bill  Gates said that uh chat GPT is as  significant as the invention of the  internet okay and this is the gentleman  who created Microsoft okay and we  already know that Microsoft has a huge  uh uh stake in uh chat GPT okay so you  know why am I talking about this right  now and why am I relating it to Clover  Health okay more specifically the Clover  assistant well  if you go ahead and look at artificial  intelligent Market size from 2021 to  2030 pardon me these projections were  made before  chat g t p or GPT was active Okay so  this open AI it wasn't even existent so  the world and the people and the  statisticians that put this together  did not quite understand the power of AI  okay that's number one  number two is if you go to 2019  Microsoft paid or 2019 2020 or whatever  it was Microsoft paid uh I believe in  19. uh a billion dollars for open AI  and then oh two three years later they  basically 10x their investment to 10  billion dollars okay  so  based off of this we may see even 10 to  to 100 x projection in AI Market size  caps uh I don't think it's it'll be a  um more than a 10x but some folks  especially Kathy Woods which makes  really bold claims thinks that it's  going to go to 100 trillion dollars I  think maybe I read that wrong  but she says some outlandish claims  but I do agree with her though there is  a trend up  now why is this trend existing why is  this going to increase in Market size  well you have to understand if you  haven't used this  um this thing is your personal assistant  uh  um to the next level  like right now I can basically say I'll  give you an example from from from a  just perspective of just a uh uh a human  okay let me just do a generic email  uh generic email  uh  fake response  here it is  so your order for bdby is not correct  sir Madam okay so this is uh a fake Best  Buy thing so I can tell chat you know  please respond to this email my name is  Al my name is Albert  uh or how about this my name is Al stock  trades okay  then what does the email even say I  didn't even really read it I've been  delivered yada yada okay be like  tell them I also tell them I moved and  do not want the order okay and here's  the email below then you'll go ahead and  chat as Chad is writing here  uh what what I'm the point of this that  I'm trying to show you  is that how many people are going to be  significant in terms of their time  management skills software Engineers are  able to write code through this they're  going to become more significant  everyone is gonna like be able to you  know obviously the level of detail of  these emails no one really likes their  where email you know write emails but uh  you know now they have a program to do  that and that's we're just scratching  the surface of the capabilities of this  AI  so I'm writing a response so this is my  email that I'm going to send to Best Buy  I'm writing a response to your email  regarding the order blah blah blah I am  sorry to inform you that I have recently  moved and would like to cancel this  order I appreciate the offer of a refund  but please note that I do not want the  order to be delivered to my old address  or to any other address thank you for  understanding and I hope this matter  uh okay I don't I don't agree with that  one but I would love a refund thank you  matter and be resolved okay but you see  how powerful this is right and all I  just did is just took some random  generic email and Screen copied OCR it  to my thing and this is a technology  that I have here it's really nice okay  so I don't have to copy or hands it down  Okay so so now let's go ahead and do  something more significant to health  okay please give me the differential  diagnosis of right upper quadrant pain  that is it  increases with intensity after eating  so just imagine there's a there's a  thing called Clover there's a thing  called Clover resistant and there's  another thing called up to date  and what this thing can do is it can  basically be self-taught self-learned to  a point where  the AI it's open right now can be taught  Clover's assistant pathway or maybe  Clover assistant has their own  uh AI that is being self-taught which we  already know they do  what's ended up happening is as Vivek  said they are not an insurance company  they just use the highway of becoming an  insurance company to basically be able  to go in and spread their AI software so  it can be trained  and as it gets trained better  the gross margins are going to start  increasing so already all I basically  said is I this patient has right upper  quadrant pain it increases after eating  and it's caused by several conditions  okay so oh sorry it increases after  intensity and it already and for all the  doctors that are watching you know you  cannot it's this is a pretty good  differential you know gastric peptic  ulcers gallbladder disease cholecystitis  colothiasis I'd probably add  colodylcholothiasis maybe primary  sclerosing you know a cholangitis all of  these other ones but again that can be  trained on those types of things but  again those are pretty rare  um  and then you know you there's a lot  right and and all I did was just  basically give it  two symptoms and I told me give me a  differential and for folks that are  watching they're not in the healthcare  field a differential diagnosis is just a  you know um it's a it's a method of  basically being able to determine uh to  be able to diagnose uh um a patient it  you know it's a framework and it helps  you not get the diagnosis wrong it helps  you basically narrow your differential  to a final diagnosis and it's been  proven to be really really if you know  uh really great so all right so that is  pretty much and this is kind of but more  information uh this is kind of a crappy  table don't look at that okay so  so that's basically what I have to tell  you in regards to this AI which  basically spent on since November and  it's closed it's uh you know  um curing in 2021. so with the increase  in AI in these artificial intelligent  markets market cap size with  uh the number of 65 year olds that are  you know turning 65 in America we're  basically here right now we're right  here we are at the beginning of the S  shape curve we haven't even began this  exponential rise yet and then again this  has been curated by old data listen guys  this has been released  by 2008 okay  so we already knew this projection right  which is why Clover was invented here if  you haven't realized Clover and a bunch  of these softwares they're invented  right at the beginning of this s-shaped  curve right colova was founded in 2014  right before this boom so it's most  likely undergone some training but now  it's going to be undergoing even more  training okay so you have a business  model right that is in an area where it  is at the beginning stages of this big  boom okay we don't know we don't know  how much as this is going to rise but we  already know that we have a company in  this area  and once AI reaches mainstream you know  mainstream media which quite honestly it  really has and if you go to the normal  you know you know Walmart worker Taco  Bell worker just a normal kind of like  the the average worker in America you  know the normal worker you know that you  know does that nine to five if you go it  hasn't reached those folks yet okay this  AI is a language model based AI so it's  probably targeting professionals  targeting people that you know you know  have some form of a job that's cerebral  but once this thing starts to basically  take over and make everyone's job easier  I don't I don't know how uh um you know  being because I I when I was in high  school I used to work uh in in in in  food right I used to make uh chicken  shawarmas and all these other things I  don't know how this will help will help  me but uh imagine once this does reach  mainstream media usage  um we don't know how and the level of  impact this is going to have on the  economy right again the target  population is probably not going to be  the the typical McDonald's or Taco Bell  worker it's going to be people that are  software Engineers people that are  doctors people that are you know a lot  of folks are saying oh a lot of jobs are  going to be lost potentially yeah a lot  of jobs are are going to be lost but  just imagine those people that do you  know that chicken shawarma the Taco Bell  and all these other jobs imagine their  next level of Life what they're going to  do with the Advent of software like this  how are they going to become creative  they could literally write their own  book become a Ghostwriter do anything  they want uh train a model I mean if you  guys don't know there's a company called  asper AI  and you know they they're a SAS company  and they're used by so many companies  now  but you know what's funny is they  actually are trained I don't know if  they admit this trained by open  AI they oh hello  you know it literally is  it it has been trained by gpt3 based  language models okay so it has been  trained by this website here okay  so what I'm trying to say to you guys is  the level of intelligence of people IQ  results don't matter anymore  if you're if you you can literally the  the only issue here is the cloud this is  not a Siri where he just gives you a  question and it forgets it remembers the  history so now I'm I'm going to I'm  going to tell it  right what was my order  number  we went from literally  uh talking about  you know right upper quadrant so now I'm  asking what is my order number  so it's thinking let's see if it's able  to according to the email you mentioned  earlier your order number is this so are  are you starting to see the power of  let's see most folks are probably going  to use this  as just you know a one input one output  okay thank you for the question but  understand  that that you can you can go back this  has memory okay so the problem is is how  big is this memory the next thing I  expect as someone who's been this  thought has been in the stock market for  10 years plus you know my next level is  is  what cloud service provider are these  guys going to use most likely it's  probably going to be with Microsoft  because right they have those  connections now  and you can literally upload your whole  life into this AI you can upload your  experiences you can upload your resume  you can upload any medical textbook that  you basically use to become a doctor  anything you need and and now you have a  smarter version of you okay  so so this is this is incredible okay  now now I'm going to ask it some some  stupid stupid question how many even  numbers  in that  order number  it's a net order number whatever  let's even gonna order order numbers are  typically sequence or visits do not have  even or odd numbers  okay well  it didn't I was just seeing if it was  able to count that's an even number  that's an even number but this is this  is this is a silly way of using I'm just  trying to see what are these things  limitations okay uh it does it can't  access paywall it can't access PubMed it  can't access these types of things but  you should play around with this because  it's very it's very clear this is the  future  and we don't understand  the significance at least I don't  understand how much Clover health is  going to grow because of this Movement  we really do not know  the level  of increase  that is going to happen with this  company especially if it's true what  Bill Gates is saying that you know this  is as significant as the curation of the  internet  so I wanted to just put this out there  in this video  you have literally two beginning parts  of an s-shaped curve because I do  believe this shows it more linearly but  I do believe it's going to be s-shaped  where you have that exponential rise  you have two curves here guys that are  um headed towards the right path and you  have a company that is basically  training its model as we speak  and literally replaced its CEO  with a technologist Andrew toy  um  so I think personally  um  I I you know I I really think uh this is  going to be a pretty big uh impact here  now in terms of visionary you know let's  ask Google  who are the greatest  uh Visionaries in the past  40 years  right  you have Elon  Paul  let's see let's see let's see if even  Bill Gates shows up oh there it is  Bill Gates  I actually do believe Bill Gates is a  Visionary he created Microsoft  right in fact if you think apple is  visionary  did you know that Bill Gates  uh saved Apple  back in 1997 Bill Gates actually that's  why they're very uh they're very  friendly with each other  Bill Gates saved apple with a 200  million dollar investment in 1997.  so so you're you know you you're saying  that Elon is a definitely a Visionary  also jobs  Steve well here's Steve Jobs  uh but then here's Bill Gates saving  apple in 1997 with a 200 million dollar  investment to rescue Apple from  bankruptcy  so um and here's an event so so that's  the thing so just just be careful  uh where you get your information from  uh there's been there's been a lot of  hit pieces on Bill Gates  uh but let's just meet let's just be  very clear I do believe he is a  Visionary and I do believe  um Clover uh uh is uh um  is tapping into this  this growth this this this this this  Rocket Fuel that that we have not seen  before we this is a this is a type of  fuel got you know every generation has  its own fuel right we have the internet  fuel this AI fuel is a fuel that we have  not seen before and we really do not  know how far if Clover can tap into this  uh obviously uh United Healthcare feels  threatened Humane feels threatened just  like how right now Microsoft Google is  feeling threatened by open AI which is a  10 million dollar company from Microsoft  a lot of companies are  um working hard right now the question  is is uh which company has trained its  AI the most and we'll see right now  we'll see who's going to win this battle  uh  uh let's see could you play  elonvi where he talks about Ai and  whatever yeah well definitely will but  he Elon is very scared of AI he believes  that Microsoft should not be the one  that basically owns the future pretty  much like that's pretty much what that  is  um it's very dangerous he believes in  Universal income because you know a lot  of jobs are going to be basically fired  um now just one more thing about about  all this UFO occurrences and all these  things not to you know diverge  which is very quickly about war  um AI you know the future Wars of our  time is going to be fought by AI I know  this almost sounds like Terminator and  Skynet uh but you know I've I recently  heard a good analogy to our DCF  intrinsic value calculations that  calculate the price target of stocks I  feel like some Hollywood movies are like  DCF projected calculations of what the  future may look like  and uh you know some of these movies  have really been spot on  um but I do believe AI with palantir as  well uh is going to be significant  um let's see here  let's see let's see let's see  well I mean that's the thing uh um  I I don't know about uh um electric  vehicles or whatnot but he did he did  create Microsoft and and that that was  just my point there right he created a  trillion uh plus dollar company I mean  it isn't a  it's an mft a trillion dollar company  Maybe I'm Wrong yeah it's almost two  trillion dollars yeah it's it's huge  um okay so  um  based off of this guys just really  quickly I wanted to just uh um  communicate this with you guys uh so you  know if you haven't realized when you  speak to people about the stock market  it's very hard to find people that are  interested in the market like yourselves  right it's very hard and finding people  that are interested in in the market is  something that is very difficult uh I  might say so this our stock terminal not  only do we have the financial data to  help you essentially be able to look at  machine and now you know machine  learning projected algorithms Monte  Carlo simulations data sets technical  analysis whatever you have you  um it also has a group of people where  you can sit down and talk and not just  that call them and communicate with them  and even do video conferences uh that we  do and then also you can do video  conferences so you know what I've  realized with a lot of stock uh Market  platforms is they don't have an ability  where you're able to sit down and  communicate and the issue is is if they  do have that ability it's a bunch of  trolls uh like Weeble or Yahoo finance  uh you really can't get reliable  information it's a bunch of emotional  people trolls some of them basically  wanting this you know are in a short  position and are basically saying  nonsense  so I would like you to consider uh the  link down below for our stock terminal  we do have a free trial if you're  interested also we have a Valentine's  Day coupon code that will be ending  shortly so take advantage of this  because you know having a group of  people that is invested and is  interested in discussing intraday  economic whatever you have you in the  stock market is extremely healthy  not just because you'll increase your  learning exponentially just like the  graphs that you see here but really to  motivate you into wanting to learn more  I mean it really is true you know you  are who you hang out with  and the type of people in here  um are uh people that you know we have  our laughs we have our laughs but at the  end of the day  uh when we talk about uh um analysis and  then when we do our analysis and when we  speak business uh we mean business okay  we mean business right and it's uh very  refreshing to see so I wanted to just  kind of point because I never talk about  the the social element of our stock  terminal I never talk about uh um why I  believe it's you know in terms of its  mental psychology of how important it is  to be surrounded by people that are  interested in the same things you are  because if you go talk to 10 people  about the stock market  um randomly I bet you nine of them maybe  eight  uh are gonna say it's a scam or X Y and  Z and they're going to have their own  pre-formed opinions so just think about  that  all right guys  um  you know  but yeah so that yeah in terms of the  whole Gates thing I mean I you know I I  do believe there there you know I you  know I do agree with him about chat uh  GDP I do believe that this is  revolutionary and I believe that any AI  that you interact with now is going to  be a hundred times smarter and this is  going to make you know my job as a  future doctor easier because now I don't  have to answer the emails I can just  basically put the obviously if there's  HIPAA protected I'm not going to put it  in here but you know if it's like a  random email to a colleague or to a  research partner I can say man can you  please respond this email and make it  say  done okay like you know how much energy  that just basically saved me  so exactly so this is the future  but the question is is how much is this  future going to make us  we already saw I mean let's just  basically let's just let's just look at  what the internet has done  I'm just picking one successful company  Amazon going back to the 90s it was 18  cents obviously it was a little higher  than that I think but but it's from all  the splits  from the peak to high 83 000  percent now it's like what 40 no yeah no  no no here Max  a hundred thousand gain  I mean if you would have put a a dollar  invested  that dollar would have  I mean it's just it's just crazy  a thousand dollars invested  but it was at nine cents would have  given you eleven thousand shares  eleven or a thousand dollars sorry  eleven thousand shares multiplied by  ninety seven that's a million dollars  right  that's only little that's only a  thousand dollars invested a thousand  dollars invested in the 90s would have  given you a million dollars  the question is  is what's the next 20 30 years going to  look like  because that's what I believe we are  here  if you look at clove  I believe  we are here we are at this level  and it may not be Club maybe another  company but there are a lot of companies  near here right now we have to find them  in terms of AI that that are going to  revolutionize  um just like open AI  and those are the companies that are  going to be the future  so anywho I wanted to put that in your  ear I'll see you guys on the next one  that's a little bit of a long video but  I you know again just whole chat GDP  thing is GPT is very very interesting uh  um and it's a extremely extremely useful  uh and I wanted to just you know have  some time to discuss it with you guys  one-on-one  um  uh yeah exactly they're going to be  fought over AI I mean if you look at  Nvidia uh Nvidia government no China I'm  just giving keywords  I'm giving keywords Nvidia stock falls  off the US government restricts chip  sales to China  right their highest AI chips why are we  doing that because  it's the future  it's going to be fun it's gonna be used  in war  uh just so I wanted to just point these  out because you know this was written in  August 31st when it happened and Nvidia  stock fell if you look at um  stock here  uh you go to here today you know it's up  40 but if you go back uh uh to August  uh here you know the stock fell  but now it's back up people people  forgot about this the government didn't  okay just just remember that uh we are  and in some form of a proxy whatever it  is we are in some form of a war okay and  the future is going to be Ai and you  know  I would find it a disservice if we did  not dedicate our channel to just kind of  discussing this  um to all of our members in our stock  mastering stock market is our stock  terminal members here  uh we're gonna you know we're gonna be  going hard on finding AI stocks and and  really trying to to also use AI uh for  our brain machines so if you go ahead  and open up our um  if you'll go ahead and open up our  proprietary software here we're gonna  we're gonna use uh we have our own ai's  integrated here but we're also going to  be using open Ai and we're going to be  taking all the data that we have which  you know is a lot and we're going to be  siphoning it in through uh um uh the  chat GPT API and we're going to back  test it and direct it back into our  stock terminal  and you're essentially  um uh we're going to see how uh um this  uh Behemoth of a brain can use our  already hedge fund data sets and  information  um to really really make a difference  okay  so that's uh  that yeah my apologies my uh my poor  doggy our older Golden Noodle left and  he's he's he loves him a lot so he's a  little sad there but uh understand that  that this platform is going to get 100  times better right because uh we're  gonna ride this wave too right I want us  to have the best information possible no  yeah most definitely and I love the  discussion I love the discussion because  again that's how we grow that's why I do  these lives you know it's a lot of my my  end I just make the video five ten  minutes and be done with it but it's  nice to have this discussion because  these discussions are not being  talked about you know if you go to the  bar right now you're not going to hear  this you're not going to hear these  types of discussions okay it's just how  Americans are Americans are talking  about the Super Bowl today I mean let's  just go ahead and go to CNN really  quickly I'm just curious I'm just  curious  okay  okay  I'm surprised there it is Super Bowl  right  right this is pretty interesting this is  pretty cool right I'll you know  um personally I use a  I don't use this to do my news we have  our own news news channel on our stock  terminal all right I'm gonna go take  care of my little boy here I love each  and every one of you God bless you stay  safe stay humble and I'll see you on the  next one
