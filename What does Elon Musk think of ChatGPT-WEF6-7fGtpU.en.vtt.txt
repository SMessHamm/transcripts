 on November 30th 2022 of revolutionary  new chatbot called chat GPT was unveiled  to the world in just the first week of  its launch it gained more than a million  users chat GPT is free online and it can  generate text based on prompts given by  its users it can create a wide range of  content from movie scripts to computer  code while chat GPT may be new the  technology behind it has been in  development for years by open AI a  company founded in 2015 by a group of  donors including Elon Musk the goal of  openai was to research and develop  artificial intelligence in a responsible  manner for the benefit of humanity  however shortly after becoming the CEO  of Twitter musk band openai from  accessing his company's database of  tweets and has been openly criticizing  the company on Twitter claiming that it  is no longer open and has been taken  over by Microsoft so what's really going  on here why is Elon Musk so so critical  of a company he co-founded it turns out  that while musk did co-found open AI he  has not been involved with the company  since he stepped down from its board of  directors in 2018. in the meantime  openai received a one billion dollar  investment from Microsoft to develop new  AI technology that Microsoft could then  commercialize but how is this possible  isn't open AI a non-profit organization  actually it used to be however before  securing the investment for Microsoft  open AI transitioned from a non-profit  to a capped profit organization this  means that investors are allowed to  receive a return on their investment but  it is capped at a predetermined limit  any profits Beyond this limit are used  to fund openai's mission of developing  AI for the benefit of humanity while  this may sound like a good compromise  the returns for the first round of  investors are capped at 100 times their  original investment this means that open  AI would have to generate 100 billion  dollars in profit to pay back Microsoft  with such a high rate of return the cap  is essentially meaningless and open AI  is effectively a for-profit company  Microsoft has already started selling  chat gpt's technology to Enterprise  customers on its Azure cloud computing  platform  there are reports that it's considering  investing even more money in open AI  elements of an AI neural net are really  very similar to a human brain musk has  long been concerned about the potential  dangers of artificial intelligence and  the risk that are composed to humanity  once computers become smarter than  people  founded openai as a non-profit focused  on maximizing the benefit and safety of  humanity not maximizing profit however  it seems that openai quickly abandoned  its non-profit status and pursuit of  financial gain while chat gbt may seem  like a harmless novelty today it and  other Technologies developed by openai  have the potential to drastically  reshape our economy and Society so what  has Elon Musk said directly about chat  GPT well on December 3rd he said chat  GPT is scary good we are not far from  dangerously strong AI now this was in  response to Sam Altman's tweet saying  interesting to me how many of the chat  GPT takes are either this is Agi which  is obviously not true or this approach  can't really go that much further so now  that the initial hype of chat GPT has  started to subside tell us what you  think in the comments what does the  future hold for this technology is this  close to Dangerously powerful AI or is  this simply a useful tool that will have  limited use that may not be that  meaningful only time will tell if you  like this content Please Subscribe like  the video and we will do our best to  keep you updated on all the new AI  developments coming down the pipeline  we'll see you next time
