 you probably heard about chat GPT and  its quick rise to Fame in the recent  months because it's able to provide  Direct Solutions to any problems you  actually have you literally type  whatever you have that's been bothering  you or whatever solution you need and  the AI is really able to give any  response that you desire and how it's  able to do that is actually crazy has  been able to take different algorithms  and throughout the internet I just give  you the direct solution to what you're  looking for and this is crazy as I use  it for school and many other occasions  and today I'm going to tell you how you  can use it for yourselves and how you  can use it for your personal benefits  maybe to make money or maybe to do  anything but all I'm telling you is that  this is the real deal like I said it  gives you different solutions and  different arithmetic solution basically  what source you want it gives you from  anywhere but you can't even find a  source right so if you just try to find  the source by copy pasting where it says  you won't be able to find it because it  uses different resources or different  websites and really different outcomes  what to whatever you write so right now  I'm a student in the AP curriculum and  as a student I've been studying really  hard and I actually want to give you a  real example of how this is useful so if  you see my screen I'm going to type one  of my units I'm doing  summarize AP Chemistry unit five and I'm  going to say simplified because it can  literally give you a simplified answer  to what you're actually looking for  which is really crazy and as we type  this  doing work right this is Magic this is  is like investing Bitcoin 2015 right you  never know where this can go but this  has the potential to be something really  big so as I just told they are to  summarize my unit that I'm studying look  it's just summarizes it in what five  difference five sentences right let's  say I'm doing a very big project and I  don't know what's going on I can  literally say look  show ways epic chemistry in the 5 show  me some  different ways  I can study  okay we write that  and boom  it gives you different options and  different ways that you can study  basically it's like a new tool that you  can use right now I gave you how I can  use it as a student right now I'm going  to actually give you an example  of how you can actually use it to make  money right let's say you're paid to  make a sales advertisement to a company  for a company or for something in your  local clinic so I'm gonna use that  example so I'm going to type here write  me and advertising  campaign  for my local  uh local local markets my local  supermarkets  right  and long  you can do long I'm not gonna do long  that's just gonna take a long time and  here we literally see  different types of things solutions that  you can do right it's saying that run a  30 second commercial entire email  campaign have a weekly sale show local  households basically you can read the  rest for yourself but it's just crazy  because it's like I'm talking to you and  you're just this one person that has  read all the books in the world and can  give me different bum bum bum bum  answers there are anything right and  this is crazy right it's just been  developed like in the last recent months  it's been famous in the last recent  months so like I said that was for work  and  let's say you'll be struggling with to  maintain consistency health and not  percussion right you can only say how to  not pro cast  right and it gives you different types  of solutions too right  wow it's just it's just crazy how what  it can do in a very short amount of time  but the thing is  how useful can this be right now I  literally do videos on how to improve  yourself how to make money and all those  stuff but can this replace everything  well the solution is Maybe  thing is when we use Google we expect an  answer right when we type something to  Google we expect an answer but as I  talked in this video of how I made that  type of money I discussed something in  that video and in that video I discussed  that we are lazy creatures right we want  everything at our footsteps everything  our doorstep we really want everything  to our service and what this does is  literally that and I think this type of  technology is a big threat to big  companies open AI was really small  developing company Silicon Valley and  when Microsoft invests in this wow it's  just blew my mind and as soon as there  was an investment competition began and  this is where the whole you know chat  GPT has been coming from is without this  big fun this will be there right this  wouldn't be running an internet but I  think that Microsoft did this for a  reason and I think it was to make making  a big competition for Google to not  being able to overtake the whole world  right that's what every campaign tries  to do but also another perspective and  how AI can develop and I think  technology is like this is going to  shape our world although Technologies  like these are so promising I do think  that chat GPT has some time for it to  mature up to become a real big threat  because I think it's in the maturation  stage where it requires some more effort  in order to become a complete software  if it's able to become that effective in  a few months I think if you were to give  it two more years I think this  technology would be used by everyone or  similar technology like this would be  used by everyone to leave on a last note  before I finish this video I would like  to thank you guys for listening  throughout the end and I would like to  just say please subscribe to my channel  for more content like this for now bye  how can you send us  foreign
