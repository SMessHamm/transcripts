 as a video creator you know how time-consuming and tedious it can be to come up with ideas write scripts and produce high quality content it can take hours if not days to complete a single video and that's not even including the time it takes to edit and publish your work but what if there was a way to streamline this process and save yourself time and energy that's where chat GPT comes in so chat GPT is an artificial intelligence tool that uses natural language processing what does that mean for me and you it means it can help you generate ideas write scripts create shortlist and advise on the style of your video it's like having your own personal writing assistant but with the added benefit of being able to understand and respond to your Creative Vision as we speak the video you are watching right now was made with the assistance of chat GPT so how does it work simply type out your ideas or prompts and chat GPT will generate suggestions and content based on your input it's a fast and efficient way to get the creative juices flowing if you hit a creative block this might be your solution allowing you to get out of your rut and start creating again but it doesn't just stop at writing it can also help with video production by suggesting music Lane's Choice locations and other elements to enhance your content it's a true One-Stop shop for video creators wanting to up their game and be ready for the future of production in imagine being able to produce high quality videos in a fraction of the time it would normally take chat GPT makes that dream a reality and the best part is chat GPT is constantly learning and improving so it can adapt to your Unique Style and needs and it's also free if you are just starting out or don't have a big team yet this is your whole production team and you can decide which roles it fills to the people in the video industry you might not know it yet but your world has just changed the way you create and consume content is at a turning point and you can now decide whether you will sink or swim okay so let me tell you a story a while back I asked a friend of mine that knows how to code to write a program that could determine how far a subject should be away from a LED screen to avoid the moire effect he wrote some code it sort of worked and we forgot about it fast forward a couple of months and I asked Chad GPT to do the same in less than five seconds it gave me the full code and a user interface I sent it to my friend he had a look at it and after a bit of debate we concluded it was very close to being perfect it's important to note that chat gbt is a tool that can assist with the creative process but cannot replace the skill and Artistry of a human just like a hammer alone cannot build a house chat GPT can't replace you but can assist you in many ways now I will be using this tool for my future project and I'll give an update on how it went so if your video maker looking to streamline your process and take your content to the next level chat GPT might just be the tool for you give it a try and see see the difference it can make in your video creation journey and let me know what you will be using it for thanks for watching and remember to like And subscribe for more videos like this I hope you found this video helpful and I hope you are excited to try this out for yourself cheers guys
