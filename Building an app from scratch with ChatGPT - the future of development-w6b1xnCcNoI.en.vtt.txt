 what's up not just developers welcome  back to a new live stream and today  we're gonna do something exciting back  in November 2022 openai launched a new  model a new AI model called cha gbt  here we have it so chai gbt is a  conversational AI model that you can ask  any question and it will try to answer  and understand the context and after the  launch of charge gbt like the internet  went crazy everyone on Twitter is  talking about it everyone is trying to  use and trying to understand what will  be the impact of this Ai and yeah if you  haven't played already with it I highly  encourage to do so you will find the  link to charge you within the  description below but um yeah like here  are a couple of examples for you to  better understand what it does so you  can basically ask it any kind of  questions like explaining Quantum  Computing and it will do just that where  you can ask it to create a keto meal  plan for a week and it will do just that  so it's uh it was trained on a very  large source of data and it has like the  knowledge in all different areas but it  might be interesting  what's even crazier is that chagibiti  can now write code can understand code  because of a separate model that it  incorporates called codex and that model  was trained on a lot of uh data like a  lot of source code so now what it can do  it can actually we can ask it for  example here I asked how to render a  list of posts in Rec native and it went  ahead and  explained me what is a flat list what is  data what is render item and how we can  put everything together with a source  code in order to have like a working  source code it can do all of this stuff  and yeah like after playing four more  time my mind was blown and I was  thinking about uh  questions like this can an AI code a  mobile application now that it has so  much knowledge and it can generate this  code  that's an interesting question and I  think  that would that would be the goal for  today's video we're gonna see if we can  with AI can code a mobile application  but if we go down uh the rabbit hole of  these questions of trying to understand  the future of AI and what impact it will  have specifically on us developers you  can get into the  um into the question of will AI replace  my job  well I don't know but in this video  we're gonna find it out in advance we're  gonna see and we're gonna take a  conclusion of if we should be threatened  by uh artificial intelligent and if it's  going to take over our jobs as  Developers  so uh the plan for today for this video  is gonna be as following uh here is me a  little developer with  um a little bit over 80 years of  experience uh developing application  working in different companies at Amazon  building my own startups and doing  everything myself now with the power of  AI let's step back and see if we can be  a little bit lazy and just simply ask AI  that's what we're gonna do we're gonna  ask how to build a react native  application and then we will see what  where judgibility will lead us to we're  gonna ask more questions until we get to  the to the wanted result and after every  step we're gonna go back we're gonna  code everything we're gonna feel  powerful just by copy pasting the code  but that's the point of today's video  that's the point like to see how easy  were if a normal beginner that haven't  written any code can use rgbt to build a  usable application  and after we code everything and then  we're gonna have a fully working react  native application hopefully if I manage  to do that because I'm pretty  um there are a couple of risks points  here uh one of them is that jgbt was  trained on data up until 2020 or 2021  which means that there is outdated data  if I'm gonna ask it something that was  released previous month jgbt will not be  able to answer me so I feel that there  is still like you need to know something  and it's still in my opinion impossible  to build an application  um with jgbt but let's see let's let's  give it a test I I love challenges and  today we're gonna find that out so the  application that we're gonna do I  decided to be a simple application a  to-do list application uh because that  is the most common application that you  build with a new technology that you  learn and also we do not have this on  our channel so yeah let's see if jojobt  can help us build a fully functional  to-do list application with different  features  what's more interesting is that for this  challenge I have only one hour and if I  do not manage to build this application  in one hour with charge gbt then I'm  gonna have to do something so I've been  actually thinking for the last two days  of what would be the uh what what should  I do if I fail to do that if you have  any ideas let me know but  um yeah let's do it like this because  Christmas holidays are coming if I fail  let's do it like this if I fail to build  a to-do list application with chai gbt  under one hour then I'm gonna sing a  Christmas song a piece of a Christmas  song here and yeah believe me you  definitely don't want to hear me sing  maybe I have skills on coding and  teaching but when it comes to singing  probably I'm gonna get like demonetized  or banned from YouTube for for doing  that but yeah that's the challenge  that what happens if we do not do that  and I think we we are we should be ready  to get started  uh everyone in the live chat hi guys how  are you doing  do you want to hear me sing and also  yeah think about the song that you want  to um want me to sing it should be  Christmas song  and and then we're gonna vote if I don't  manage to do it but I'm ah  it really like there are so many  variables in this challenge 2gbt is  getting a lot of  um traffic nowadays uh in the first five  days they had more than one million  users using it so sometimes  um like it takes a lot of time to get a  response sometimes  um the interface can yeah like can go  out so hopefully that will not happen  today let's hope that uh like from a  technical perspective everything is  going to be okay and then then we will  have like the challenges of actually  building and implementing and  trying to think of the right questions  to ask jgbt in order to give us the  answer that we want and that is that  that is probably the main goal uh and  that is probably also a very good skill  that a developer should have whenever  you have a problem you need to put it  into words and search for a solution and  you do that usually on Google maybe in  future we are going to do that in chat  gbt but at the end of the day your job  is to put problems in words in order for  the AI to understand you and to lead you  in in the right direction  we want both we won't have a completed  task and also a song from you uh that's  not gonna happen either one choose one  Jingle Bells  oh my God and with my uh with my like  accent singing English songs it's even  worse  Shivan that's a very good idea to work  with Dale to uh or diffusion AI  um I if you'll enjoy like these type of  content let me know down below and we  can dive deeper into these AI models we  can work also with images  um and um yeah like I'm all up for it  it's really impressive and I think that  this is when the future  all right so  um are we ready  actually I didn't prepare anything for  uh for today so that's gonna be like  um that's gonna be interesting  um so bear with me we're gonna go  through  a lot of uh  confusion but we're gonna solve it  together step by step uh with you so are  we ready uh let me actually grab a  terminal probably  and also I'm gonna open up a visual  studio code just to have it ready and  then we can get started  so I want to make the terminal bigger so  you can see  just like that and also let me  open Visual Studio code  and make sure that we are also zoomed in  as well here  and if I put it this way  everything should be good to go  all right  we developers want the task and this is  December and December month want a song  from you and I'm not gonna trick me I  see you  I'm gonna do it in one hour you'll see  hopefully  all right all right all right so  um if we're ready let's get started so  quickly to summarize everything that I  said so far we're gonna ask  chargeability for instructions on how to  build a mobile application a simple  to-do list application but we're gonna  try to implement uh multiple features so  it's going to be a fun challenge we have  for this only one hour  um we have already like only one hour if  I don't manage to do it I'm gonna have  to sing a Christmas song for you here at  the end and I hope that uh I will not  have to do that because that would be  embarrassing so let's start our timer  and one hour starts now let's go how do  we start uh yeah let's start with a  general question on uh how to build a  mobile  application using react native I'm gonna  try to not use as much knowledge as  possible and make the question as  general as possible to see in what  direction charge gbt will take us for  example here like as a beginner I might  not know about Expo and I'm interested  if it will recommend us doing with Expo  or with react native CLI but I think I'm  gonna  trust it and I'm gonna go with what it  says so as we can see here is some  information about react native we don't  have time for that because we have only  one hour and first of all the first step  is to install the react native CLI the  command line interface by running npm  install minus G Rec native CLI so let's  copy this command and while chegebt is  still answering our question let's go  ahead and install  react native CLI globally  uh and while vet is doing in the  background we can look at the next step  create a new project by running react  native init my application okay I'm  gonna copy paste as much as possible  today  probably the video should be like  um  not using the keyboard only copy paste  projects let's go there and here let's  do  um  one second  oh today I'm pressed by time so I'm not  gonna have time to be perfectionist  meaning that we can skip through some  Styles and so on so let's go ahead and  paste the command react native init my  application and I'm Gonna Leave it even  the name like that  so while this is downloading the  template let's have a look navigate to  the project directory using CD my  application okay we're gonna do that  after that is done start the react  native packager open a new terminal  window  navigate to the project directory  and run the application on iOS simulator  by running acne to run iOS or on Android  emulator by running ok  this will create a new Rec native  project with a default component such as  single objects file that contains root  component for your application from here  you can start building as we know that  and Rec native uses a syntax that is  similar to react so if you have  experience with react it should be  relatively easy to learn do we have  experience with react I don't know yes  let's say we we do have we can also use  third-party libraries and plugins to add  okay this is very general and it only  shows me how to start and run the  application I'm gonna do the same how to  build a mobile application using rack  native bike but I'm gonna be a bit more  specific I want to ask it specifically  about a to-do list application let's do  how to build M To Do List mobile  application or just application because  if it's Rec native I think it will  understand that it's a mobile  application let's ask it this way maybe  more specific will work better  Aman  um if you reach out to me on Instagram  I'm gonna get back to you like these  days I've been preparing for the live  stream so yeah  uh here is a general outline of how you  can build a to-do list application with  react native set up your Rec native  development environment by following the  steps outlined in the previous answer  can you imagine that like it  automatically understand what it already  um gave us an answer can I  I'm gonna do some uh  some hacking here  it's not really hacking but I want to  get rid of the this panel will I be able  delete  no it was a bad idea okay never mind  I I just wanted to zoom in a bit like  this yeah so uh where are we so  set up the development environment  following the previous answer like it  already know that it gave me this uh  environment so we already have an  environment created we also have a no  it's installing Coco pose dependencies  so we are still waiting for the  application to create  then create a new component for your  to-do list this component will be  responsible for rendering the list of to  do items and handling the user  interactions  Define the state of your component what  I don't know is how can I edit it so if  I'm a beginner  how can I edit the code of react native  application will it recommend me some  IDs for example I specifically didn't  ask about the IDE because as a beginner  your question might be more General  foreign  native application you will need a tech  text editor or integrated development  environment ID that supports okay okay  includes Visual Studio code Sublime Text  and webstorm okay that means that it led  us to yalex to Via Visual Studio code  once you have a text editor installed we  need to open the created project in  Visual Studio code so let's go ahead and  visual studio code and let's open our  project  so it should be hearing projects YouTube  and here should be Live 2 and my  application let's open it here and this  is our application okay back to our  charge B Team  I'm gonna actually zoom out a bit  because it's too much  um  I'm gonna go back to the previous  instructions that we have in here we uh  it's saying that we need to run npm  start to start by development server so  let's go ahead and open a terminal and  do npm start  I'm gonna zoom in probably a bit more  oh Metro is 0.72 okay that's nice uh and  what's the next fifth step open a new  terminal window and navigate to the  project directory let's open a new  terminal window and we are in the  project directory what should we do next  uh run the application on iOS simulator  by running react native run iOS  or on Android I'm gonna go with iOS if  you have Android you can of course use  Android  so we are seven minutes in uh so I need  what uh password I don't know the  password  please work oh my God  oh  I'm in a hurry and I make mistakes as  always  so  um  what's going on found xcode workspace  core simulator detected version  framework does not match existing job  version attempting to remove a stale  version in order  oh my God what's going on here  uh did we skip any steps no we didn't  unexpected I in Json run a simulator oh  my God don't do that to me right now  launching unable to boot device in  current state booted  okay  I really hope it just by running it the  second time it will magically start  working  usually does  and here we also see the time so it will  take a bit of time for the emulator to  run  but we can go ahead and charge gbt and  see what's the next steps so this will  create a new react native application  with a single file up.js we are curious  so let's go ahead in our project and see  up.js  so here is where  our code leaves  or section replication yeah maybe as a  beginner we still don't understand this  code  um  so going on to how to build a to-do list  application for more details let's see  create a new component for your to-do  list this component will be responsible  for rendering the list of to-do items  and handling user interactions but how  do we do that and check this out if we  ask jgbt how to do step two  will it understand and will it explain  us specifically how to do step two of  this  creating a new component for your to-do  list  let's see  to create a new component in react  native it understood exactly what I  meant you will need to define a  JavaScript class that oh JavaScript  class oh my God  uh I'm not ready for that  but this was the challenge that I was  talking about it was created with a very  not a very old data it's all data in  terms of programming because a lot of  things are added day by day to to our  ecosystem uh what  yeah it's trained with data from 2020  and before so that's why it recommends  us a class component I truly don't  remember one as the last time I was  working with a class component  oh but can we ask it uh how to do it  with a functional component will it do  the same but with a functional component  how to do it with a functional component  okay 10 minutes in almost 11 minutes the  time flies very very fast and I don't  even see the application on my device  I'm still waiting for it to install oh  my God come on  will I regret not starting it with Expo  because I don't have any icons now I  don't have anything so it's gonna be  interesting request time out  uh how to  let's do it again let's do it again  that was what I was too many requests  oh no  that's nice that's amazing  11 minutes in and we are already uh  hitting the limits of CHA gbd too many  requests and if I do it again if I just  refresh it will yeah like forget  basically the history of our messages so  I'm gonna have to start from the  beginning  how to build a to-do list application in  react native  with okay let's do it just like this how  to build a to-do list application in  react native  on the other side our application is  bundling and it's has been built  correctly and here we see we see our  starter project with the application  running on the device that's good from  this side we are we are good  let's see so set up recognative project  using ivorac native CLI or Xbox CLI  that's amazing I didn't have this option  previous time but I'm gonna still  continue with rack native CLI design the  layout and user interface for the to-do  list this could include a list of to-do  items a form for adding a new item and  buttons for making items is complete or  deleted use rack native components such  as viewtax okay use Rec native state  okay this one is a bit more General oh  so  here is some example code to demonstrate  how you might Implement a to-do list  application in Rec native right away we  have  code I'm gonna wait for it to finish  building and I think I'm just going to  copy paste it in my application  um Jason is saying charge gbt is going  to replace us newbies  um let's wait until then to to see the  outcome so it right away gave us the  code for our component so let's press  copy code let's go in our application  and let's replace in our up.js  everything with the new code let's save  and let's see if it's actually working  it's actually working and I see it there  somewhere around the top  um  [Music]  should we just fix it or  uh how to to ask it  to fix it  okay I'm gonna add a little bit of my  knowledge but let me try to ask it  um how to make the content in react  native  um  not be displayed behind the iOS notch  I think this question is very general  like from a person that doesn't know  about I didn't mention about safe area  views let's see what it recommends us  how to make the content in react native  not be displayed behind iOS Notch not  sure if that's a very good uh idea to  make content react native app not be  displayed behind the notes on iOS  devices you can use safe here we have  view component provided by rack native  perfect let's go ahead this component  has padding to the top here is an  example how to use it we import it from  react native and we put our content  inside it okay perfect that means that  we just learned a new topic as a  beginner this is nice so save save area  view I'm gonna add it uh for my  content  and yeah just like this will it work yes  it worked amazing so here we have our  input if I'm gonna write here something  hello hello  and if I'm gonna add  um something is happening I don't  understand what  uh how are you add  it's being added but I'm not sure where  for example  I see complete and delete buttons here  uh but the text is displayed to do text  add to do  input value you see the problem like  right away it gave us a code with some  bugs for example when we save it in  state we simply put the string there but  when we  render it here we have to do text  um  uh so how  um how to  write and  function add  to do how is it called add to do  that will insert in state and new object  with a property  text  um and the value  will be taken from  another variable input input  input value  will it answer us will it help us figure  out this bug but again I think as a  beginner this would be the moment where  you get stuck because you do not see any  text  what I looked is okay if I don't see the  text how we are displaying it I see that  we are displaying it by uh by going  to do dot text and to do that text I was  looking like okay in our to-do list how  do we save it well we don't save it as  an object we have value tax we we put it  directly there  um so how to do here it is awesome set  input value so how to do  what's gonna that's how it's gonna be  changed and now if I'm gonna add new to  do add now it's gonna have a have a text  uh  by milk add and here we have by milk and  now if I press delete it's going to go  ahead and delete it and it the deletion  actually works  it works as we expected for example if I  want to delete this one perfect now  um maybe we can add some styles to this  container so  uh how to  dial  uh the view container of one to do list  item what it will do  so far so good uh let's see we have  adding to to-do list deleting from there  uh and also completing what does  complete do in our code at the moment so  if I press complete it does complete to  do  okay new to the list oh it adds a  completed true property there  okay I understand but does it do it  correctly so new at in the yeah probably  does it correctly  so it has that checkbox uh request  timeout  hmm that's gonna be challenging but we  are 20 minutes in  be more specific tell it to move the  code in the mid to the middle of the  screen  to move a code which code  jgbt will turn newbies into Sinners  that's very good uh  way to think about it because yeah like  at the moment I see it not as a threat I  see it as a help for Developers  um so to style The View container of a  to-do list item in Rec native you can  use the style prop and pass it an object  with desired styles for example uh let's  try this one your to-do list item it  means that it should go here like in the  to-do list  map  uh okay that's something this will apply  a yellow background okay you can also  Define our Styles in a separate object  and use style prop to pass to the view  okay  this allows you to use the same you can  use any of the Styles supported in the  view okay let's try to do these  um defining a style object as it says  and applying styles.container  Styles dot container  um  so  to use the Sims okay view component  style prop for example Flex Direction  and so on okay here are two styles that  it generated maybe they will look good  one of them is for the text one of them  is for the container and that means that  we also have to go ahead and hear for  the text probably it says yeah like for  the text we need to add Styles text the  one that we created down below  okay  um it's still weird container it has a  background yellow so let's ask for uh  for let's give it more details  um  style uh container view in react native  uh with  Minima Mini malistic  with minimalistic I don't know  Aesthetics looks a minimalistic design  around corners uh Shadow  some space thing inside spacing outside  uh what else outside and  [Music]  um  children and a line  no aligning it's okay  let's see what it will give us in this  scenario  it has character limit of yeah  like four beats so don't make it full  conversation it just has something that  doesn't require deep convo  um I think like asking it for like  specific features uh it works pretty  well so far like it it has like enough  capacity to answer and to include once  we're there  to sell a container react native  minimalistic design here is an example  that you might style so let's see  container view Styles container faster  faster we are 23 minutes in background I  border radius Shadow color shadow offset  okay I think that's gonna look good I  already can picture it in my head  uh okay container  if I do it like this okay something is  better something looks okay uh now what  uh should we do  um I want to make sure that these  buttons  are in the same uh line so  how to put two buttons in the same line  in react native and we should already  think about some bigger tasks because  now we can uh oh all right  um I'm gonna Mark the one that are  completed with gray background  so we know that whenever we press on  complete  what did we actually do what our code is  doing that's also a task for us we need  to be  good developers in the beginning in  order to understand the code that was  written by the AI  because I think with without a lot of  experience you wouldn't understand like  What's Happening Here  for me it's clear that we simply go  ahead and for the item that we completed  we are adding one more property to that  object besides the text that property is  called completed and it has the value of  true so I'm gonna ask charging team  after this is done so it  teaches us about Flex Direction on a  view component and putting them wrapping  them in a view component so let's do  that so it's pretty clear here like what  you should do you see two buttons and  you see that it's wrapped with a view  with this style and also it explains  like in detail oh my God I'm not sure  about your job as developers but my job  as a tutor like definitely might be in  danger  um all right so  as I was saying like our buttons we  wanted to put them inside that view that  they suggested and now they are in the  same row perfect okay  um  how now about the background color so  how um  how to change that background color of  the view to Gray  uh if  [Applause]  uh to do list item  has  uh the property  has a property is completed work can  completed to uh true  equal to True let's see  what  okay  okay so we have 26 minutes so far what  we can do is we can add a new to-do list  item new item add we can add them here  um we see them in a list I'm gonna add  more and I'm gonna show you a problem  but we can ask chargpt to fix  the problem is that when we have a lot  of them we're not scrollable but we're  gonna get that in a moment so here to  change the background color of A View to  gray if a to-do list item has the  property completed equal to true you can  use style prop and pass it an object  with the desired Styles you can use  maternary operation to conditionally  here is an example of how you might  change the background color of A View to  gray if to do list item has property  okay so view style to do completed  Styles completed Styles incomplete and  then we have completed an incomplete  okay let's go with this approach so we  have to change the style property of our  root view of our container  and the container is this one  where is it come on Style  so instead of style container I'm gonna  do Style  if to do  completed style completed incomplete  now I know that I have to change from  here from container  tool complete  to how is it called incomplete  and we know that we have to add one more  style so I'm gonna just duplicate this  one I know it's not the best code but  I'm not trying to write the code that I  would write I'm just trying to copy what  we suggest so now they suggested me to  have two separate Styles and I'm just  see I simply duplicated them and one of  them has  background color red for the completed  so I'm gonna go ahead and for the  background color uh I'm gonna move it to  gray so now it looks like this I'm gonna  probably do gainsboro  to mark them with a lighter gray like  this and if I complete this one  nothing happens why  uh why nothing happens  delete delete delete delete delete  delete  delete  one two three so if I complete this oh  this one is complete No it should be of  our way around so this one is incomplete  it should be with white  and the completed should be with  gray sorry that was my mistake and now  if I complete the second one it moves to  this one and if I delete we get rid of  it perfect  um  I don't know what else what else oh uh  else we had like that issue  um  I'm gonna do some kind of um  to do  um style input  I don't know what else uh yeah we'll see  um I want to do scroll  scrollable list  um  how to render the list of to do  items as a scrollable list I don't know  a very general question to see where  judge BT will lead us  I'm wondering if it will suggest like  the scroll view with a mapping word  directly a flat list most probably it's  going to be a flat list  you can use the flat list yes so so so  far it is recommending us then  um mapping but now it will recommend us  flat list here is an example of how you  might use the flat list okay let's see  let's see we have to do list we have  text item completed it already knows the  structure of our so  it already actually has some predefined  items so that's actually very good and  I'm gonna go ahead  no I'm not going to change anything to  be honest because this is not a state  variable so we need it to be a state  variable and that's why we're gonna  leave the way it is the only thing that  we're gonna change is probably this flat  list so I'm gonna copy the flat list  hopefully from this text if you have a  time and read it you're gonna understand  how to work with a flat list so what I'm  going to do is instead of this mapping I  already know that we're gonna use a flat  list we need to make sure to import it  from react native of course  um and if I scroll down a bit  so for the flat list the data is to-do  list item basically the same as this  variable in the mapping  then render item for every item instead  of rendering a simple text what we're  gonna render is exactly this View  so let's copy it from here  and let's put it here  where is it yes like this  and key extractor it's gonna take the  item dot text yeah that's okay  uh all right so now we can remove this  mapping because we replaced it with a  flat list and now if I'm Gonna Save  key index it also needs the index here  save uh is here instead of to do it  should be item uh completed and here  item dot text  yeah you know I know these things but  the beginner I'm not sure if he will  know so probably um where it is but you  still need some experience I'm gonna go  ahead and grab actually this dummy data  and I'm gonna put it as the default  value for our to-do list here  just to have like what to work with  uh like this so we have item one  completed true item two not completed  and this one is completed and now if I'm  gonna do more  uh they are scrollable but the thing on  top it remains there  okay that's good perfect uh maybe we can  add the text input and the button at the  bottom of the screen like after the flat  list let's see if that will work  so now  um not really working  uh because the flat list would need now  I'm gonna leave it there I don't want to  get into these details it looks good uh  what else what else what else I wanted  so we have we are scrollable we have a  scrollable list we can add things where  we can complete them and we can delete  uh okay you know what I want like a very  technical task  I want to be able to persist with data  so after we close the application  completely and then open it again I want  to have the same to-do list items and  actually we do  that's not possible  oh oh oh it's okay  um we are coming from this  item one item two and item three but if  I'm gonna add one more for example this  one and if I'm gonna close the  application I'm gonna come back then new  item that I added is not going to be  there and we're gonna start from uh from  these three items from the beginning  so let's go ahead and ask jojobiti how  how to  persist data  um  uh on that device  storage in react native or how let's be  more specific how to persist data  um  to-do list  how to persist that to do list data on  the device storage in react native let's  see  maybe I don't even have to put rack  native because it will know from the  context but we are talking about track  native and it's going to be an even  easier conversation like how to purchase  data and I think it will understand  35 minutes 35 minutes  come on come on this is an important  um to persist but to-do list data on the  device storage and react native you can  use a sync storage API provided by react  native I think storage is as simple as  synchronous okay okay okay actually I  think storage was moved to um to a  community package so I'm wondering if it  will work probably it will not so let's  go ahead and import testing storage from  react native as chai gbt is recommending  us  let's go ahead here and we see that I  think stories has been extracted from  react native core and will be removed in  future uh it can also be installed like  this one so  this is another point where you need  some some experience with ref native to  understand an issue to to read it and to  see like okay maybe there were some  changes but yeah like here is what we  have to do it we can install it uh using  this rack native Community testing  storage so let's copy that name and  um and let's go ahead and install it  using npm install  and Rec native Community I think storage  how's it called a sync storage simply  yeah I think storage that's it  all right all right so what  uh could not resolve a dependency react  native thing started from the root I  think storage  what's going on here  um  uh how to install  arachnitive sync storage  has moved to the organization oh my God  this package has been deprecated  so I think rack native I think storage  uh how to install it come on I want to  install it  uh multi-platform  get started npm install okay it's from  here  so as you can see because  um  because of an outdated  um information data set we receive  recommendation that are a bit outdated  uh  in rack native  okay after installing it let's go ahead  and continue  basically from the documentation we're  gonna  oh we need to link Android and iOS  yeah we need to run and Export pod  install  sorry npx pod install  and  Mac OS  okay  and usage I'm gonna import a sync  storage from here  in our app.ts yes so import using  storage we delete it from there and  let's go back to our cha gbt  uh and see what it recommended us so as  we can see it recommended us using a use  effect hook uh fetching data a way  testing storage get item to do list if  to do list then  um yeah it looks very good I think  storage set item to do list Json  stringify when the to-do list updates  okay let's go ahead and grab these two  user facts  and drop them in our application and as  we saw like we should be somewhere  let's do it here  we need to also make sure to import use  effect from react  and we need to  run the application again on  um  on iOS because we installed a new native  dependency  okay guys whatever features you would  like me to do because after persisting  I will take two more features that you  would recommend in the chat so let me  know in the chat what features do we  want to add  uh be reasonable because we have 20 more  minutes and we can do that one of them  probably will be styling like working a  bit with styles  hmm  maybe I can ask charging how to render  um  how to render  um check box  um I can  in react native how to render checkbox  icon checkbox yeah before we completed I  think like because it's um  time of posting or when completed yeah  that's that's interesting  um  so we have our application running  we have our item one item to item three  let's go ahead and delete item one and  item two and let's go ahead and refresh  that close the application and open it  again if we have only what my item three  that means that it works yes it works  and if I close it again and open it  it's still there and if I add item four  add item four  something else then if I I don't know  yeah let's  close the application open it again and  with data will still be there  awesome so we have a scrollable list we  have  um persisting data  um what now what now  um  what I was asking it here how to render  checkbox too many requests no come on  like I'm not doing too many requests it  was  for a reason like believe me come on  you can do it  I still have 18 minutes I can do it  too many requests please  foreign  if I'm gonna do a new chat oh okay  how to render  a check box icon in react native  come on come on Chad please please  it's 17 more minutes I don't want to  sing  to render a checkbox I can interact  native you can use checkbox component  from react native paper Library here is  an example how to use it react native  paper should we try that we have 17  minutes that's a separate library to  install and that can give us a lot of  um  troubles checkbox checkbox okay let's  try let's try uh  how to install react native  paper  and we are going to ask this question  here but I'm not gonna wait I'm gonna go  in them rack native paper in the getting  started and I'm gonna do npm install  react native paper we already actually  learned how to install a library so  we're gonna do that and we need to do  npx pod install after that and it's  gonna take a bit of time let's do it uh  come on scanning  if you are on vanilla Reckoning you also  need to install and Link Rec native  Vector icons on now  uh my oh but Vector icons can give us a  lot of problems oh my God installation  oh okay 15 minutes and I'm getting into  a completely new UI library that they  have never used before  um  for each component if you're interesting  iOS browse Rec native fonts edit info  list available phones you have this one  uh let's go ahead in there it said to go  into iOS  into  info where is info here and somewhere  add that and  false here  we need to put the fonts  just like that  and we need to run npx pod  install  I hope it affects everything what we  need to do for iOS Vector icons to work  foreign  so let's go ahead and do a run AOS  uh and why does chargeable recommend us  to to use so checkbox status checked  checked and checked on press it checked  ah color Okay size and unchecked color  so let's take this checkbox uh we need  to probably import it from react native  paper  uh at the top of our file  uh checked is a state for us it's a bit  different uh this will render color okay  let's take the checkbox from here  and where we have a button  complete I'm gonna add the checkbox  after  and instead of checked I'm gonna  see if item complete that's  of the thing and when we press on it I'm  gonna do the same as we did here  complete to-do list like this  and  just like that and now we do not need  the button I think  uh checked and checked what's going on  so size 20 unchecked color  what's happening okay but if I  complete to do okay  it's not there unchecked  unchecked color unchecked  ah getting started uh check box check  box uh normal normal  Android come on usage checked unchecked  is it correct  unchecked uh how to add property status  disable and press and checked color  unchecked color custom color for  unchecked so if I do unchecked color  blue  uh  no I'm checked oh unchecked color here  is black  color theme test ID title uh removed  what's going on status checkbox status  yeah that's a bit weird uh but I'm gonna  leave it like this and I'm gonna do the  on press event on the whole view like  when we press on a view I want to check  it and that checkbox actually I'm gonna  put it probably near the text itself  like at the beginning here so here I  will do green  okay and if status is completed then is  checked okay and for this view I can ask  chargpt  um  how to handle on press event on a view  um so I already know how it's done we  need a pressable component so I'm not  going to waste time to hear an answer  but I'm gonna check it nonetheless and  for the container that represents one  item I'm gonna put the pressable here  and I'm gonna move it on press from the  checkbox to the pressable so the  checkbox is simply like um  and I conveyor so now if I'm gonna press  on this it's gonna be checked and if I'm  gonna add something it's gonna be  checked perfect uh  also maybe I want to toggle it back so  complete to do  um  so view on press that's not gonna work  in my opinion because the view doesn't  have an on press event  uh you can also use a touchable past  yeah that's already right that's already  better but I'm not gonna do that at the  moment uh we can delete we can add new  stuff uh let's add the new stuff at the  beginning of a list so I'm gonna change  the order of here  and I think I do a lot of things without  chargeability  come on  okay  um and yeah like what I wanted what else  I wanted to do  um  someone recommended one of the features  that I see is to show the title removed  I mean like uh crossed so let's ask  share the BT how to display that text  uh how is it called like crossed or not  underlined crossed not crossed  word deleted I don't know in react  native that's the problem you need to  know what you want chagibiti to uh to  answer you because if you don't know as  I do right now  um striked it's strike how to display  uh at striked striked text in react  native  striked 12.  trike strike through  strike through okay how to display a  strike  through  texting Rec native come on come on come  on  let's do uh to display Cross or deleted  texting racknet you can use text  decoration line property prop okay this  prop allows text decoration line line  through CSS property Works in web  development  uh my man but that's not web development  let's try let's try text decoration line  line through uh stop please  so four of uh text when we display the  text here I want to add a conditional  Style  if it if  item  text decoration uh if item is completed  that's going to be lying through  uh otherwise so here like yeah I put a  little bit of my knowledge how to render  conditional styles  nine  okay and when we complete we display the  text as strike through and here for this  container we can also do a line a line  a line a line  items where is the line items Center  Center  justify come on why why where is the  recommendation oh because yeah justify  content Center  uh align items I don't know why it's not  working so I'm Gonna Leave oh oh oh oh  because I need to do it here as well  uh uh I don't need justify I need no I  don't need the line items I need only  justify it still doesn't work so no  worries I think for the text is  align items  items Center  align items okay never mind never mind  um so what else what else we have seven  more minutes uh let's add that time when  it was created  um so how to add the created at time uh  for a new to do list object let's see  how to Advocate it at time for a new  to-do list object  so if we've managed to display the time  on the screen  then we consider the application done  because the to-do list application  should allow you to  import complete tasks delete them if you  want to to delete and come on we need  created that time for the new to-do list  object  come on come on come on  it's five more minutes  five more minutes please check  and request time I would  why why when I need it the most  come on come on come on we need the  intense music  before I start singing  no and how to add the Creator time for a  new to-do list  for a new to-do list item probably  please please  guys don't oh to add created a time to a  new to-do list object you can use date  object in JavaScript here is an example  how to do that to-do list name items  created at new date so yeah here it  explains that create that will be  displayed with new date so let's go  ahead and in the add to-do list item  that's also important like you will need  to know where to put it so we are adding  the text with the input values and the  second up parameter will be created at  which will be initialized with a date  that it was created at now does it show  us how to display you can also use the  other methods of date objects such as  tostring or to UTC to store the date and  time in different formats how to render  it on the screen  um so I'm gonna take it step ahead and  I'm gonna render it where where should  we render it uh probably like after the  button and we think it's a bit for the  delete button we do not need this view  anymore I'm Gonna Leave it because jgbt  didn't tell us to do that so here let's  do a text uh with uh but not here  in the flat list  in the Yes actually it's here  text  it's gonna be  item dot created at  and now nobody will have anything but if  I'm gonna do  come on  come on come on please I need to see it  on the screen missing semicolon where  uh created at  oh my God  we are missing semicolon  no no you don't have missing anything  text everything is good come on original  math had apply  eight minutes my heart is racing  original method what kind of original  method come on what did I do wrong  reload please no  dot created at  save oh my God where  is it here  no no please  where  I'm gonna stop the server and start it  again you know  I am a genius myself  it means no no missing semicolon for a  moment you had some other file opened it  opened automatically missing semicolon  way here oh my God I'm gonna  comment out the whole flat list that's a  very fast debugging uh reload  uh I'm gonna comment how would they use  effects  they use effects  uh reload  delete to do  please what did I do wrong git do you  show me anything  foreign  [Music]  what did I do  come on  complete to do where oh Style no no  Styles maybe in the Styles missing  semicolon  tiles  backend.js file you have a type of air  where where back and adjust I don't have  a backhand backhand  backhand I don't have a backhand address  I'm right  oh no const here const const oh oh oh oh  I'm gonna do z z z z uh  uh reload what no no I didn't fix it I  didn't fix it  no  text oh here text text uh item dot  created created Created at  reload  no  oh my God that's a fail that's a fail  and it does so and I see the bug oh my  God you will not believe it it's right  here where it was showing me a yellow  line all this way and if I add it  everything is broken if I had it  no it shouldn't be um  time's up  you're gonna sing yeah oh my God I'm so  pissed  why I am so close just I was thinking  like five minutes to display created out  like it's it's too easy  come on  I feel defeated and I still want to fix  it  where is it coming from where did I  forget to  missing semicolon in devtools in the  devtools not modules  did I  by mistake did any changes in the node  modules so if there are issues coming  from node modules I'm gonna go ahead and  do air ram RF node modules to remove  node modules and install it again npm  install  uh yeah just npm installed  oh my God  all right yeah that's  the sad part about it  I still see the syntax error missing  semicolon in react Dev tools  no no oh that was from the previous one  uh now let's try  npm start  I'd be so pissed that  the application was actually working  uh yeah the application I think was  actually working it doesn't  objects are not valid as a react native  child  created at  dot to  um  UTC string  or how  no it was recommending us created that  format  oh this is with enthl  two UTA two string two UTC string oh it  should be a question mark yep here as  well like some of them do not help now  it has like Friday  and so on  uh and I think that yeah guys let me  know ideas for songs and I'm gonna sing  it in a moment but I want to put them to  to make this application look a little  bit better uh I want them checkbox  to be after the text or better with text  before the checkbox just like this  um  size 14 I don't know something like that  not sure why it's so up there  size doesn't exist  does not exist on checkbox what do you  have  checkbox  status color theme and that's it it  doesn't have a size I don't know why it  thought it has a size  here what do you want uh  uh quick fix  disable uh I don't want it  all right so here we have our  application  um it's working  one two three I add something we'll  um  persisting work as well  with the dates and so on and I find it's  not a function  oh because created add  maybe we need to do a new date here  because created that when we read it  from them  from the storage that created the date  yeah I'm gonna do it like this when we  read it from the storage the created it  is was a string so we were not able to  run two UTC out of that but now it works  with new ones  and it should also work with the ones  that we read from the storage right away  yes it does  uh with delete button uh I'm wondering  if what will it say like  um  how can I implement or  yeah how can I Implement  swipe to delete features in react native  all right guys so uh this was the  experiment uh we're gonna see maybe we  can add some other features if you're  interesting but that was uh everything  that I wanted to do today  um  it was a very fun challenge trying to  act as a beginner and try to use an AI  to build an application and yeah like  what have we learned out of this  experience so far  um we have learned yeah stay tuned by  the end of this live stream for for the  promise song we're gonna do that  um by Van yeah we I already see some  interesting ideas like Cucaracha is it a  Christmas song I Don't Know  um so what I wanted to say is that  it turns out that you still need some  knowledge of a technology that you are  using in order to understand basically  what code to copy you cannot simply and  blindly go ahead and ask chargeability  to build you an application and just  copy paste things around that might work  for like simple use cases but when you  get into a little bit more customizable  features and things that you want to  build the way you want them to look in  that situation you actually need to have  a lot of context around react native and  allow War around them the technology  that you are using  and you need that  that knowledge about that tool in order  to yell like as I said to know where to  to copy the code where to put it from to  be able to detect bugs because we saw  that chargeable team uh even by default  was producing some bugs here and there  because it's not perfect but why it's  not perfect because it was taught based  on the code that we developers wrote so  yeah like various different code there  is outdated code  and I think for that reason we as  developers should not be threatened by  AI so far  um at least like yeah like for this for  this time I don't see AI as our enemy I  see it more as our friend  so basically yeah like it's not here to  replace our job it's here to help us and  also it's here to open new opportunities  for us I think instead of yeah like  um what we did today asking jojobt to  help us build an application this is  just one use case you can build so many  things using chagibi team and you can  take charge gbt functionalities and the  ability that it knows everything and  Implement a business on top of it  judgmenting is a very general uh AI  model and  it is our job as developers to take this  technology and to put it and to solve  real problems with it go ahead and  brainstorm like what ideas you can build  with it if you're interested on how you  can Implement cha gbt and open AI in a  project for yourself go ahead and check  out this video we will leave it  somewhere here from the previous week  where we learned and built a fully  functional application with cha gbt we  actually haven't built one we built two  application one web application and one  Rec native application and both of them  are connected to the same back end that  is connected to chargeability and is  providing Christmas gift ideas if you  haven't checked that video out make sure  to do that because it's a very  insightful video it shows you step by  step how you can implement it as well  so yeah that's that's my take at this  moment uh it's there is so many  opportunities out there that we can  Implement using charge gbt uh and it's a  it's a thing that I would love to  explore more and if you're interested  let me know Down Below in the comments  what other projects you'd like me to do  and actually  I was thinking about this and I'm gonna  do it here today I know with a lot of  people  uh in the comment sections want me to  build an application with flutter and I  haven't done that so far I have never  worked with flutter  uh and my day is if this video gets 1000  likes then I'm gonna do a similar style  of this video however in flutter and  what I'm more excited about that video  is  today I had some knowledge and  experience with react native and this  Challenge and even though I had this  experience I failed the challenge and I  will do that I will sing the song in a  moment but  um my question is how can a beginner in  a new tool use this and will it actually  be that useful because I think  that yeah like I used a lot of my  knowledge and experience today and we  followed this  um if you haven't wrote uh reacting if  you haven't built a rack native  application yourself I'm not sure and I  really doubt that chagibiti will be able  to meaningfully help you  um do that so if you're interested me to  build react native applications make  sure to check out our playlist and our  tutorials on our channel uh we have a  bunch of project build tutorials step by  step where we explain react native and  if you are at a point where you already  build a couple of tutorials from our  YouTube channel and are ready to advance  to the next level as a full Stack mobile  development developer then check out  academy.nojas.dev this is our premium  courses that is taking you by hand and  teaching you the full life cycle of  building an application from the drawing  board implementing the user interface  with react native building complex  designs animations with complex things  and when putting it together with a  connecting with a backend designing the  back end implementing everything  improving the performance packaging it  for production and finally delivering it  to the users you're gonna learn all of  this process in the course so if you're  interested make sure to check out the  link in the description because the  enrollments are currently open  uh and so guys let's see  um what ideas do we have  or what questions so I see La Cucaracha  uh remember power tools did not replace  carpet Carpenters exactly uh I think  that we should not be afraid of  disruption because that's the only way  uh forward because it would be very  selfish from our side to say oh we don't  need all of these disruptions because  it's gonna replace our job  but why do you feel so entitled to have  all of the Innovations like phone  computer internet and all of this stuff  um when the creation of the innovations  that we are using today also contributed  to a lot of jobs being lost  so yeah think about this and  we should embrace we should adapt we  should learn we should befriend have the  AI because in future like we might use  it more much more often than you think  oh ask chargerbt what song to sing  that's a good idea  um  I okay let's see I lost a challenge  to my beloved community on YouTube I  have to sing a  Christmas song  suggest me a popular Christmas  song  to sing and show me  the lyrics of one how's it called like  paragraph I don't know one  yeah I'm gonna do it like this let's see  uh I I love your idea David like to ask  jgbt to do something nowadays everything  that we have to brainstorm uh with our  team like uh for some reason I'm always  like going back to how we were doing  before and trying to think for example  even for this video that you are  watching right now  um the way we came up with a thumbnail  and the title was first we have idea we  started brainstorming with everyone in  the group chat what would be the title I  was um  um yeah I was suggesting a couple of  them but nothing really clicked and then  Catalin which is our video editor he's  so uh he's so on chagibiti he's using so  much and yeah like he's like let's ask  jajibiti to uh to think about of a title  and Vinci LGBT gave us like 10 titles  that were all so good and so catchy  um and yeah like we we chose one of them  and we went ahead after that we had to  do the thumbnail again we asked rgbt  what you do for a thumbnail for this  video and it recommended us some ideas  even though like we didn't listen fully  but it had like very interesting ideas  to and to to do so yeah we are we  already see the impact like we I got  started uh with chagibit I mean I  started learning about it a couple of  weeks ago and now we already use it in  our day-to-day job  uh isn't it beautiful I think it is uh  it's making our life easier it's making  our job easier it's giving us new  possibilities and I think that's that's  really exciting  uh do you have a tutorial about how to  create responsive design we do not have  that at the moment but it's in our list  of tutorials so uh guys we have one  popular Christmas song that you could  sing is Jingle Bells here are the lyrics  oh my God  I'm gonna have to do it so  look what we're gonna do  we're gonna sing  we're gonna sing and the worst part  about this is that we're gonna sing uh  without any music because that's gonna  be copyrighted so that's gonna be even  worse so all right I'm gonna sing only  the first part  I need a lot of water  hmm  um  all right so here we go guys today I  lost a challenge on YouTube uh because I  haven't managed to build an application  using chargeability in one hour what a  bad developer even with an AI uh in the  help I failed miserably to build that in  the last seconds and it was a very  stupid mistake I just had to reinstall  the application here we have here is  your song that I promise  in a one horse open sleigh over the  fields we go laughing all the way Belson  oh my God what are these words bells and  bobtail ring making spirits bright what  a fun it is to write and sing a slaying  song tonight jingle bells jingle bells  jingle all the way I am going home thank  you for watching guys and I will see you  next Friday Also here at 3pm JMT battle  super cringe sorry for that
