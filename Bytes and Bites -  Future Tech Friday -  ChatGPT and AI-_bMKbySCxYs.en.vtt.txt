 hey gang welcome to Future Tech Friday  I'm Jim as you already know and today  chat gbt you've heard about it right if  you haven't you've probably lived under  a technological Rock because it is all  the and the next word really is  dependent on what you think about it all  the rage all the fear but what is it and  where does it fit within this AI  conversation that we're having let's  take a little bit of a deeper dive not a  huge one but try to do some things we're  even going to try to get on to chat gbt  test something out although since I'm  doing this and recording this live  you're not seeing it live it may or may  not be at capacity so we'll figure it  out so first first let's talk about  generative Ai and you see on the screen  right here a basic definition it's a  type of artificial intelligence that  involves creating new original content  no surprise we've seen a lot of this  coming down the pike lately Dal Dash e  of open AI which is the same company  that's making the chat gbt has done that  there are other iterations that are  there but at this particular Point what  we want to do is take a understanding of  chat gbt it's a bot it's an automated  system but it's much more rich and much  deeper in terms of the content that it  can provide back and why not just go  right there right now to see what we can  do so I'm going to get into the chat gbt  here it is and as you can see there's a  we're experiencing high demand so let's  see what we can do let's go down here  and let's ask it a question let's ask it  a question you know who is Paul  McCartney something very very simple  and we'll hit here and we will see and  it says a musician singer songwriter for  Liverpool best knows remember the  Beatles you know sort of what you get on  Google right so you're getting  information that's up there although it  is giving a nice list of content that's  here in terms of a story and separate  into paragraphs and chat gbt is kind of  um focused on a lot of stuff so more  than 150 million records better than  what you'd get on Google better than  what you might see in Wikipedia  interesting but again it's AI so it's  digging the information it's been  trained that's with a generative part of  generative AI or a lot of the AI is is  focusing on but let's go a little bit  deeper let's say right  me a love song  in the um I don't know style of  McCartney  typing never optional  writing lyrics really  okay so are you standing there in the  morning like boy uh who you pulled that  one from one of the first songs because  there's a side nylon man I don't know  I'm I'm not sure oh my darling what's  interesting right here is it's pulling  lyrics from some of the song titles that  McCartney has written and whether that's  actually a legitimate song that you'd  want to sing  um even has a bridge in there pretty  pretty phenomenal when you think about  this that this is an artificial  intelligence writing this and I didn't  prompt it I didn't do anything before to  set this up  even has an outro in here and okay let's  see at the end it says it's a fish no  song came up with it might not be the  exact style and might not reflect his  songwriting style but it could be an  inspiration for that  um pretty phenomenal when you think  about it so the question gets driven  good or bad  and the answer is  depends depends on a lot you know on the  good side if you're somebody who is  going to be saved by research that is  done through the development of AI or  have a surgery that AI has been able to  Target and precisely make sure that  whatever they're trying to get rid of in  your system is taken care of that's a  good thing  um if it's tracking people and harassing  people and based with a basic  developmental bias and let's face it AI  is as racist and sexist as the human  species is and I'm not valued judging  there I'm just saying the reality is  it's being taught by stuff that it's  being fed there's been a lot of  conversation about Facebook's AI with  photo recognition and how it was very  very skewed very  anti-minority and that's a horrible  thing so I hate to get into the  conversation ever with technology about  whether it's good or whether it's bad  because it depends on your point of view  but clearly I would say you you  shouldn't be  concerned about it but you should be  concerned about it and that's the  Duality nobody likes to hear right we  all like to know is this good is this  not good what we know is it's here to  stay and what we want to see is what  might be on the horizon is an awful lot  that's happening right now with these  particular tools for example there is  this Valley that has come out in the  year these are folks who are putting  this together to try to take a three  second snippet of your voice and have  speech synthesize and in fact through  this demo right here you can actually  hear and I'm not sure whether you're  going to be able to hear this I hope you  can but there's going to be a speaker  prompt we descended the letter and found  himself soon upon firm Rock  okay so at that point it was the person  speaking and then you can click on the  Val Dash e approach they moved  thereafter cautiously about the Hut  groping before and about them to find  something to show that Warrenton had  fulfilled his mission  and that was completely generated by  artificial intelligence just from that  three second snippet  go to bed I'm not going there you are  perhaps but I'm not other things that  you might want to be aware of right now  a really cool article that I've seen in  the past couple of weeks was about the  student who created an App hadn't been  able to dig it up yet called gbt0 that  identifies based on an AI algorithm the  possibility of plagiarism in a  particular piece of written text uh in a  school and actually you can go into here  and you can watch this on Twitter and  see it work there's no sound on it it's  kind of tough to see but pretty amazing  what's going on in terms of the  capabilities here a couple other things  just to look at the AI image generators  have been out there now for a little  while doll Dash e is one that has been  around for I think six to eight months  at least in terms of open and this deep  AI text to image generator so I put in  there Thomas Jefferson playing baseball  in the rain  and um  that's what it came up with just from  some basic text text to artificial  intelligence  um kind of I don't know kind of all over  the place from my perspective I think AI  is it's here to stay no question about  it it's going to be used it's going to  be used well it's going to be used  poorly we have to be very aware and very  Vigilant about how it's being used to  restrict other people and how it's being  used to create more bias than we already  have in this world but at the same time  we don't want to as the saying goes  throw the baby out with the bathwater  because some of the opportunities for AI  might be absolutely phenomenal in terms  of saving lives or coming up with new  developments and disease prevention  whatever it might be But whichever way  you lean on this conversation is it  going to take your job away is it going  to enhance your job it's all going to be  dependent on a point of view so instead  of having a point of view about this  just have an open mind be aware and make  sure that you're not sort of Left Behind  because 2023 just might be the year of  AI thanks for being here have a great  weekend gang see you next week
