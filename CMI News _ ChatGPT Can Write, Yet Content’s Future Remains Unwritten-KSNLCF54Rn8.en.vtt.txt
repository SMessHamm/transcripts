 for you is it going to steal your job  was this segment written by a robot you  know I for one actually welcome our new  AI copywriting overlords yeah that's  right this is what's new that you need  to know  hello everybody Robert Rose here with  the news it's what's new but really it's  what's new that you need to know in the  world of content marketing strategy and  for the best and best practices I do  encourage you to head on over to  contentmarketinginstitute.com well  unless you've been buried under a rock  for the last week or so you cannot have  avoided the news that there is a new  content writer waiting to join your team  and it that writer is a new artificial  intelligence spot called chat GPT now  what strikes me as a bit ironic that the  amount of digital ink being spilled  about this digital bot is being designed  for a bot that is designed to well help  us build more digital link but the tool  itself is pretty simple it lets you type  in questions using natural language and  then the chat bot answers those  questions in conversational and  sometimes well quite remarkable ways now  the world seems to be giving this a go  and as of the production of our news  this week open AI the come company  responsible for launching access to the  chat GPT app has closed off new accounts  until they deal with the demand that has  exploded over the last five days or so  now the world has started to react to  its capabilities and responses seem to  be falling distinctly into two camps  Chad GPT is either the end of the  content creators World stealing our jobs  infringing on copyrights and or chat GPT  is a magical cauldron of wonderfulness  that will rescue businesses from the  drudgery of content marketing creation  what's our take here at CMI well it'll  be neither of those things and it may or  may not be a fundamental disruptive  force in the practice of content  marketing some have said the chat GPT  will fundamentally change everything in  marketing forever others have said it's  now past the Tipping Point and we have  to actually look at it explore it and  accept it one writer even referred to it  as a pocket nuclear bomb and that should  be withdrawn from our Collective grasp  immediately because we are just not  ready for it and whether you agree or  disagree with any of those particular  responses it's all been a bit dizzying  most importantly the majority of these  responses and the conclusions they draw  should all be tempered with the same  word yet  yet is what I urge you to take away from  all these conclusions including this one  by the way this technology is still in  its formative stage just wait in this  rush to create business models out of  the artificial intelligence content  creation engines there will likely be  bad actors those who do utilize  generative AI technology or even fake  versions of such in a way that actually  does harm content creators infringe  copyrights and the creative process and  the people who create wonderful things  however it's just as likely there will  be good actors who leverage this  technology to further the craft of  writing and challenge us and the tool to  get better at our craft using it now  right now when I look at the quality of  content coming out of chat GPT however  quote impressive unquote it might be I  think it probably says more about the  quality of our current marketing writing  than it does about the capabilities of  GPT it's just not that great yet the  question that remains right now is what  should we do now is professionals my  advice play with it explore it start to  understand its capabilities and its  limitations and where it might fit into  your process how will it change you in  my column this week I go into a little  bit more about my thoughts on this but  one thing I am noticing is that there  are tens of tools out there that use the  chat GPT technology to fuel the power of  things like copywriting and content  marketing blog writing and SEO writing  and there will no doubt be tons and tons  of these solutions by the summer be  careful of the ones that position this  Innovation as taking the drudgery or  grunt work out of the creation process  or that position this as a magical  cauldron those two extremes are really  not what this is about this is a  critical point what I do know is that  every creative content person I know  doesn't view the activities or  capabilities that AI will ultimately  address as drudgery or wasteful or  especially mysterious or magical  creating content is fun it's also hard  it's also frustrating it's also  ultimately satisfying so when you think  about it digital film editing that  didn't take the Artistry or drudgery out  of cutting and splicing film together it  added an extension that the content  creator would be now capable of things  they couldn't do previously in a more  efficient way  digital imaging software like Photoshop  didn't remove the drudgery from the  artist or opening the mixing of paints  together in a creative way prior to  putting a paintbrush to Canvas it just  added a new capacity to that process  giving artists an entire rainbow of  color palettes to work with without  opening a can of paint our take AI will  open doors it will extend the  capabilities of riders and other content  creators just as it closes doors on  other activities it will transform the  process of written content Creation in  business it will change all of us but  how it will do that though is still very  much up to us and that's what you need  to know it's what's new that you need to  know in the world of content marketing  strategy I'm Robert Rosen remember it's  your story to tell delawell I will see  you next week
