 hello everyone  welcome to another episode of cloud  Solutions Academy I'm Naveen balani  first of all wish you all a very happy  New Year  and thank you all for your love and  support and subscribing to this channel  so in this week's episode I'll talk  about charge ubt and address some of the  questions around it  like will chat GPT replace Google search  engine  or will charge EPT replace human jobs in  future and also share my perspective on  chargpt while answering those questions  so let's get started so what is charge  upd chargpt is an AI conversation  chatbot you can ask questions to chat  GPT and will provide detailed responses  you can then ask follow-up questions on  the responses  while AI chatbots are not new the  detailed responses and conversation you  can have with chat GPT on a wide variety  of domains  P technology travel generating marketing  content  or writing an essay makes it quite  interesting  and charge EBT is trained on a massive  data set of unstructured and structured  data and provide Dynamic human-like  responses based on the training data and  it's available to everyone over the web  which makes it accessible to everyone  so here's a quick demo on chat GPT  simply log into the website  and ask a question  and follow up based on the responses  but with all these capabilities will  charge GPT  or in general any conversation AI engine  replace human jobs in future or search  engines like Google  to answer this question  I like to call out my code for my book  AI can learn but can't think  so thinking would always be left to  humans on how to use the output of an AI  system  AI systems and the knowledge will always  be boxed to what it has learned but can  never be generalized like humans  where domain expertise and intelligence  are required  the fundamental issue with conversation  AI be chat GPT or early Watson systems  is a lack of domain intelligence  so what is an example of a domain  intelligence  let's take a very simple example where  you ask the conversation AI engine  to suggest outfits for shots and sorry  fundamentally any skilled person would  trade suggestion as two different  options  like find me matching outfits with  shorts  and matching outfits with sari  or maybe ask clarifying questions  or suggest these options are disjoint  and can't be combined  but with chat GPT  or further matter any general purpose  conversation AI  the responses would be as shown in this  video  clearly without understanding the domain  and the context trying to fill in some  responses  so this is a very simple example but the  complexity grows exponentially  where deep expertise and correlations  are required  like a doctor recommending options for  treatment  and this is a very precise reason where  we saw many failures when AI agents were  used to solve health problems  they tried to train general purpose AI  rather than building domain expert AI  systems  another point is explainability making  the AI output explainable  and how it has arrived  and I've described this in my earlier  video  and explainability might be one of the  legal requirements in future  so while chat GPT definitely advances  conversation AI  a lot of time and effort would have gone  into building this  so in my view  chat GPT and other AI chatbots to follow  will be similar to any other tool to  assist you with the required information  and you will use your thinking and  intelligence to get the work done with  see any technology will have its own set  of limitations including chat GPT  and my intent was to bring awareness  around this so you could build chatbot  applications  keeping all these limitations in mind  so to conclude I like to say is sit back  and relax  the current version of chat GPT or maybe  any AI conversation agent in future  will not replace anything which requires  intelligence and human expertise till  then signing off happy learning
