 okay what  what is it doing  we'll chat gbt replace software  Engineers let's find out  chat GPT has been making headlines  recently with concerns about students  plagiarizing answers stack Overflow  Banning the use of chat GPT answers and  talks of jobs being replaced by AI  but us software developers really at  risk of their jobs being stolen by the  machines they helped create I decided to  put it to the test to test How likely my  job was going to be stolen by an Android  I devised a number of tasks ranging from  simple to difficult and tried to use  chat GPT exclusively to solve the  problems I ranked each task by giving a  score based on how many mistakes the bot  made and how many times I had to correct  it or fill in the gaps using my own  personal knowledge the higher the score  the worse Chachi Beauty you've performed  I decided to use a Point space system in  order to determine how well Chachi BT  completed each task every time the bot  made a coding mistake I added a point  these mistakes did have a couple of  exceptions such as misnaming due to file  names or assumptions about what I was  running on my system as long as it  helped me figure out which packages I  needed to install on my system with all  that let's jump into these tests  for this first test I wanted to see if  chat GPT could create a simple get  request to an API of my choice  this API was the cat fact website a  personal favor of mine  not only did I want the API request  being made but I also wanted chat gbt to  uppercase the word cat to cat in  capitals to show my appreciation of my  feline friends  I ran this test in three different  programming languages of varying  difficulty python rust and C plus to  really test the robustness of chat gbt  across different languages so let's give  it a try  so here we go our first test is coming  through okay so far so good let's go  ahead and just test this code that it  gave us back  okay so so far this looks pretty good  it's working as expected let's go ahead  and ask if we can update the oh it also  tells us we need to have the Russell  Quest Library installed that's great  let's go ahead and see if we can get it  to uppercase the word cats  okay so far this looks pretty perfect  let's go ahead and paste that in  yes amazing okay so it seems to have  worked you can also use the word office  it's giving us a different oh that's  actually wrong yeah I think this one is  wrong  let's have a look this is interesting  I'm gonna just make a new one so I think  this one is wrong let's give it a go  yeah that that's that's not right so I  am going to dock at a point because it  gave us an answer that isn't correct it  gave us one correct one but it also gave  us something but pretty good pretty good  for the python let's go ahead and  actually try this again in Rust  okay so here it goes so this is using  hyper which is interesting okay so this  is also telling us how to do Tokyo okay  let's let's go ahead and ask this one a  couple more questions in order to get  started let's pretend I'm a real newbie  here  we go so it is telling us that we also  want to get hyper TLS as well it hasn't  told us about Tokyo let's try it let's  just copy and paste it in  that's actually telling us the change in  there as well that's great and it is  giving us Tokyo as well that's pretty  awesome  um okay open the cargo Thomas file enter  dependencies okay this is pretty good  this one might be perfect now it didn't  tell us where to ride this I think I'm  going to give that one a bit of it I'm  not going to be too mean to it because  that is a bit mean  okay let's go ahead and try this see my  project cargo build  hmm okay that is a point deducted  unfortunately  um that is wrong so but fortunately  cargo tells us what to do here so we're  just going to fix it whenever I ask that  one okay so again we've got another  another error here so yeah this one  isn't working I'm gonna have to use a  bit of my intuition here for this one so  how many points have we got here they've  got 1.2 points taken off of this one not  currently running on the Tokyo 2x  timeline that might be three points  let's have a look okay so it did work  kind of um it didn't pronounce the  actual fact it just kind of printed out  the  body string  I think that's four points wrong I think  that's another point wrong let's see if  we can get it to uppercase the word tars  the Json response  so let's let's go ahead and actually  give it a chance maybe you can claim  that point back it's on three at the  moment uh this wasn't 100 correct but  we're gonna ask it to do something else  okay let's add the dependencies in  perfect and it is telling us about this  string let's try this okay here we go  now this one is is slightly better it is  giving us a bit more of um we're looking  for and then it just has the effect of  fact okay let's try this did I miss  something here okay that is something  else that is wrong consider reporting it  I'm gonna do it but I'm going to give it  a point unfortunately that's four points  so far so I think Four Points so far  but that did get it done got it done  before points that's not bad at all okay  how do I UPS let's go ahead and see if  we can do this that seems a bit  redundant it's not really a need to  actually rename that it's not wrong  though it's just interesting  um okay so let's try this  it looks like it's the pars response is  actually being changed a little bit not  where I would do it but that's not bad  okay I guess because it's uh  starting with a cattle I think we'll let  that off because I think that's just you  know me doing the classic genie in the  bottle of telling it something and it's  doing exactly what I tell it to so I'm  not going to give it a point now but I  think that's four points in total for  the rust example so not bad uh not as  good as python I don't believe we had  any errors with python but with this  so I think we had one point with python  actually one point because it did get  one thing wrong  yeah four points for the rest okay and  let's try this now in C plus plus this  one's gonna be the hardest one I think  okay C plus plus 11 I like that I like  that a lot  holy moly  okay what  what is it doing oh it is actually  trying to create the HTTP request from  scratch depending on the operating  system that is crazy also just how crazy  and difficult C plus is but uh yeah I  didn't complete this I'm gonna give this  a I mean this is just an outright fail  maybe my scoring isn't working here but  that's one point okay this is this is  looking better it's gonna do it in Carl  so that is one point already for C plus  plus curl lipco is probably the right  way to go about this for a little  Simplicity but that's definitely one  point so far  okay let's see if I can run this let's  ask it how I can compile okay so that's  so far pretty good  um it is assuming and I wasn't going to  penalize that I do have lip curl  installed oh it's actually telling me  how to do this in cmix that's pretty  good do you know what I'm actually just  going to take a device there it's giving  it to us let's see  well let's just call it app I think Alex  beautiful app okay so far looks good  yeah pretty good it's not pulling it out  okay let's have say how do I parse the  Json so this is impressive I was not  expecting it to also give me c make  that's really nice okay that looks  pretty good let's copy this in I don't  know if I have rapid Json let's have a  look I mean I don't think this is gonna  build but I'm not gonna give it a point  if it tells me how to do this yeah okay  so no such file or document rapid Json  how do I install rapid Json Linux let's  figure this one out  okay let's give that a go  yep so far so good  okay I think this worked  yeah nicely done okay so that's pretty  awesome let's go ahead and see if we can  turn the uppercase the word cat into an  up case okay this is cool it's uh giving  us something which is pretty useful  what I'd love to see is it not give you  back the entire response but kind of  tell you where to go ahead and put it  um I guess this is great for beginners  but I think it can be a little bit  tedious when it's having to go through  and actually add everything but let's go  ahead and  add this in  that comment is a really nice touch by  the way uh I think this  failed I think that's another point it's  so close  it's so close so close  that's another Point against it I think  um  it's two points two points so far I mean  it did better than Russ but it didn't  actually get it so I think it's a  failure in total um what about just  upper casing  the word cat let's see if it can fix  itself  okay it may fix itself it could be  because it's a harder thing to do in C  plus  but if this doesn't work then I think  it's ultimately a failure on the C plus  plus point I think this is only going to  update the first word cat in the  response which is a bit of a shame uh  there probably needs to be a for Loop  going on here yeah so it only finds the  first word of cat you could probably put  this in a for Loop or a while loop  let's go ahead and do that let's see if  we can actually  let's go ahead and try this out yep okay  so this one now will work so we just  need to be in a for Loop there was a  little bit of human interaction there so  I'm going to add another point to it I  mean it did kind of work I I guess it  didn't it was a failure let's go ahead  and call it a failure but at the same  time  it did it did pretty good job um I'm not  upset with it it just didn't exceed it  didn't reach the end of the goal um if  we're being strict about it  so for this second test I wanted to see  if it could work on the other side of  the problem and actually create an API  or an API Handler for a simple cat API I  don't want to let the AI choose the API  I wanted to do I want to actually make  it set to cat I think when I did this in  my testing it went to Books A lot of the  time so let's go ahead and see if we can  actually return our own custom data type  again same rules apply we're going to do  this and go though we're not going to do  this across different languages I want  to see if it works in our language it  hasn't done yet I think it would be fine  in Python but go is going to be an  interesting one so let's get started  for cats using it to go so this one's a  little bit different it's actually  telling me how to do it rather than  giving me the answer which is  interesting now it does give me an  example which I'm excited about  but I like that it's giving an  introduction on how to do it okay now it  looks good actually let's go ahead and  run it  okay that looks correct  yeah that's great it actually returns  cats and Json that's pretty good also  talks about using a different Library  that's cool okay let's uh let's go ahead  and see if we can add an endpoint to  create as well  here we go let's see if we can do that I  love that he gives the cats the names  fluffy and mittens as well okay so that  is pretty cool  um  let's go ahead and test this one  uh tells us we could use a switch but I  mean it's still technically correct  let's go ahead and try it it also looks  like it gives us an example on how to  actually create this using crl so that's  pretty nice I'm going to try this now  okay cool whiskers ah did it work I  don't think it did  ah it lost a point it didn't add it it  did not add it to the slice  unfortunately also it looks like it's  creating it every turn so yeah that's a  shame that's a shame it's it's almost it  does tell us add the new cat to the list  of cats here so I mean we can do this we  can actually fix this let's do this and  then cats  equals append cats  cats I mean that's what it would need to  do  ah shame it was so close so that is a  point against it okay so that does work  now very close to it but unfortunately  doesn't look like it past that one it's  got a point against it so all great apis  have logging associated with it I want  to see if we can add structured logging  to our API whether the chat EPT can  actually do that  logress is interesting logos is actually  deprecated let's see if I can get it to  use zap I prefer to use that interesting  that it gave us the request ID as a  hard-coded ID that's probably not great  I'm probably gonna have to fault at a  point for that that's two points so it  does do this it is hardcoding the  request ID is probably a bit of a faux  pas but maybe I should I'm going to give  it a point just because it is a bad  thing to do  what about using zap instead  it's also telling us how to install it  which is useful let's go ahead and try  this  okay so it needs to get going mods  that's fine let's check GPT  go mod tightly fine  let's do this  okay so there was a bit of a knowledge  there but I'm gonna let it off on that  one  did you tell us some important it did  tell us an important it also told us to  import zap core which is interesting I  don't think we need that core again hard  coded that request ID gave us some  logging all right let's try it okay so  that is something wrong I did it use  that core anywhere  I don't think it did so that's another  Point against it that's three points so  far I mean that's pretty good  considering but yeah zap core is not  needed  um so let's go ahead and run it okay yep  definitely different because it's  actually using the debug logger rather  than the production logger so I think  that is  something I got wrong but I'm not going  to fold it for that one yeah I mean this  is pretty good thumbs up I mean it  created the API for us it's all the best  API in the world and certainly not  production ready but that's pretty  awesome that's pretty awesome and the  contextual compensation was really  awesome  so for this third test I want to see if  chat GPT can actually create some  database tables and write some complex  SQL queries let's get started so let's  see if we can create a cats database  we're going to use postgres for this one  let's have a look that's pretty cool now  I don't want a Serial column I want to  see if we can get it to be a uuid column  I like that it's giving us an  explanation of each of the fields type  in here we go  so it's giving us the euid is also  giving us the default want to generate a  uuid that's pretty cool let's go ahead  and see if we can actually do it  okay so here we go let's get in  and let's just copy this in there and  see ah  okay the uuid function does not exist so  that is one failing of it let's go ahead  and actually see if we can solve that  problem  okay that's the correct extension I  believe  so installing it first  that works okay let's try it again okay  so it did solve itself I'm going to  deductive point because I had to then  follow up with it but I think that's  pretty cool let's see if we can get it  to change the age to be the birthday can  I change the age field to be a birth  date  field  using an update  okay so it's going to use the order  table statement that's good don't know  if this is gonna work let's have a look  uh yeah see this is this is the other  problem so yeah I think that's  definitely a point against it maybe even  two points  I'm gonna give that two points against  it because that is that's just not gonna  work unfortunately let's move forward  I'm just gonna drop the common let's  just add a column then  okay so that's good uh hopefully it's  going to continue thinking it has that  column let's see  can you generate some dummy data for me  let's see if we can get some data to  actually be inserted  okay cool that looks pretty good let's  see if this works  that's nice we've added some  let's get some more dummy data I think  okay so we're gonna get some more dummy  data  and I've asked for 10 more rows which is  great this is pretty awesome because if  you really want to make sure you test  for some dummy data it can't generate  that for you as well it also looks like  it doesn't overlap with anything add  this in perfect that's another 10. so  we've got 14 cats on the table now now  the final test I want to see is can it  give me the oldest and youngest cats by  gender let's have a look and see can you  return the oldest cat  for each gender  let's see if they can do this  okay that's pretty awesome I guess it  can do the youngest as well by just  saying that to descending that's good  let's see if we can do it based on  gender and breed as well how can  I get the oldest cat  or each gender and breed combination  here we go  order all there we go that's me doing it  wrong  okay that is pretty cool so that is  really really cool so that was pretty  awesome I only have three points against  it I am very impressed by its sequel  parsing yeah good job to chat GPT  so for this final test I want to see if  we can get chat GPT to draw a rectangle  to the screen using opengl this is going  to be a hard one I think so I'm not  optimistic but yeah let's jump into it  and see what it can do okay can you draw  a rectangle to scoop the screen  using opengl in Rust  okay this is quite a lot of code for it  to actually write out let's jump ahead  and see if it actually gets it done okay  so it's giving us the full code to be  able to do this let's go ahead and copy  this into our rust project to see if  this works  now it needs the glium package let's see  if you can tell us how to do this  perfect  let's see if this works that is a point  against it I'm not sure why it was  trying to do 32 and it doesn't seem to  have that in the actual crate but we're  going to go with 32 anyway but that is  one point against against this for the  moment there is a Vera there and yeah so  far this is not working now  could not find events Loop in gluten let  me just do some investigation into why  this may be okay so there was about five  or six things that were wrong um I found  most of these by looking at the  documentation so not bad but definitely  not great I wasn't expecting it to be  able to do everything however now if we  go ahead and run this  we get a rectangle on screens so it  managed to complete everything it just  wasn't perfect but overall I'm pretty  happy with how this worked  um the event Loop stuff isn't great I do  think I can close this window yeah  whenever I try to close it it it doesn't  seem to work but if I press Ctrl C it's  fine so I'm going to give this maybe 10  points because there was a few things  wrong and I definitely had to look at  the documentation but it did complete it  didn't fail the test which is awesome  and this is actually something very  difficult to do so I'm impressed that it  managed to do it so in conclusion what  do I think do I think it will replace  software engineers  no I do not I do think it can add it as  a tool to help software Engineers be  more productive especially when trying  to solve common problems or generate  Snippets of code that may be useful for  software Engineers the one thing I was  really impressed with was the cmake  suggestion for C plus plus that is  something that is very very valuable and  very tedious I've also seen it work well  with creating make files which I think  is incredibly valuable for any engineer  that's working within C plus plus being  able to work on common problems and give  answers I think is something that is  very very useful moving forward but  those answers aren't always guaranteed  to be correct that is why stackoverflow  banned the use of GPT in its answering  system because the answers aren't always  perfect and can sometimes be wrong  overall I think chat CPT was really  awesome but I don't think it's going to  be coming after anybody's jobs anytime  soon however I thought it was pretty  cool to see and I had a lot of fun  playing around with this
