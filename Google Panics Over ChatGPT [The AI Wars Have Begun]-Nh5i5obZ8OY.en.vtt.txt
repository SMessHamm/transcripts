 hi welcome to another episode of Cold  Fusion  this was Google in 1998 so we're right  between that house  and this house  renting this  half of the house  ping pong table  here  going to the Legislative Office  there's Larry  CEO of Google  say something  hi  it was a small company run out of the  garage of Susan wojcicki who is  interestingly the current CEO of YouTube  simply from recognizing the value of  organizing information on the web Google  managed to grow from a few tinkering PhD  students to a formidable giant that now  owns over 90 percent of search  and carries out over 8 billion search  queries per day  for two decades now Google has been the  Undisputed king of web searches the term  Google has been synonymous with  searching for information need a recipe  or remove your review or just settling  an argument with a friend you can just  Google it  with a net worth of 1.15 trillion  dollars in 2022 they seem Unstoppable so  what exactly could make a massive  company like Google Panic so much so  that they issued an internal Code Red  well it's open ai's chat GPT of course  with Microsoft's plans to integrate the  AI system into their search engine Bing  Google search May face a serious threat  for the first time in its history  could this be one of the biggest  technology story arcs in history while  making this episode I kind of felt like  we're at the beginning of an AI War  so in the following we'll learn what  Google might do about the situation  they're actually already fighting back  we'll get into that and we'll also see  why exactly chat GPT is such a threat to  Google's Central business model let's  take a look  Fusion TV  [Music]  when to transform just about every  industry including education chat GPT  pass the US medical licensing exam the  bar exam and got a B on a Wharton MBA  paper  a conversational chatbot capable of  responding to any query in a human-like  manner always seem to be a technology of  the future for the masses anyway until  chat GPT  following its release chat GPT has  garnered huge attention from around the  world  to give you an idea of the scale of this  moment chat GPT has been the fastest app  in history to reach 100 million users  it's taken just two months whereas  tiktok took nine and Instagram 30.  a rapid adoption rate is a classic early  signal of a disruptive product or  technology  a couple of months ago we took a deep  dive into chat GPT since then it's been  updated and is better than ever  however as I previously stated it's  important to know that it's not perfect  and may sometimes give bias or outright  incorrect information if you want to see  that episode on chat GPT and open ai's  views on the future of these systems in  more detail the link for that episode  can be found in the description below  [Music]  Microsoft is looking to capitalize  namely by putting this technology in  their search engine Bing the massive  implications of this will be discussed  later in the episode but for now we've  got to find out something how did  Microsoft and openai get involved with  each other in the first place  the alliance between the two started in  2019 when Microsoft invested one billion  dollars into openai this was very  crucial for both companies open AI  needed some cash as well as the  computing power of Microsoft's Azure  cloud services this allowed the AI  research firm to scale and drastically  reduce its operating costs Microsoft on  the other hand was able to acquire open  ai's intellectual property portfolio in  the process  in essence Microsoft now has access to  some of the world's best AI technology  giving it a Competitive Edge over other  major players in the tech industry since  then Microsoft and openai have been  working together on various projects and  specifically chat GPT CEO saty Nadella  saying its impact will be quote at the  magnitude of the personal computer the  internet mobile devices and the cloud  [Music]  when Microsoft made the bombshell  announcement that they were integrating  chat GPT into Bing Google was in shock  an emergency code red situation was  declared and I could imagine the Frantic  meetings one Google executive told the  New York Times it was a make or break  moment for the company  but wait this is Google we're talking  about the company with Far and Away the  world's leading search engine they  dominate 90 of search queries Microsoft  with their dinky little Bing accounts  for only nine percent of worldwide  desktop searches in 2022  so why is Google panicking Google is  looking at what might happen in the  future and not what's happening today  chat Bots are not new but the level of  performance seen by chat GPT definitely  is the thing that sets it apart from the  Medicore chat bots of the past is that  it's a generative pre-trained  Transformer or GPT in plain language it  just means that it's been trained on  billions of parameters and petabytes of  text this training allows the system to  generate new text in a way that mimics  the understanding of a wide range of  queries and can respond accordingly  chat GPT or the inevitable flood of AI  assistance has the potential to  revolutionize how we interact with  search engines  Microsoft could see this as well and  that's why they've been betting on open  Ai and its technology  for a second I just want you to stop and  think about it if an ai-powered search  engine gave you the specific information  or answer you want in a concise manner  but you could also ask further questions  and drill down into the details that you  want this would be revolutionary you  don't have to click through a bunch of  links and waste your time right now if  you want a specific answer you have to  Google what you're looking for get a  bunch of results that may or may not fit  and if it's specific enough you end up  going to a forum anyway and searching  through all the answers there in this  ai-powered search engine world the  answer would already be synthesized for  you and this is because the AI has  already crawled through the whole web  and read it already and I think this is  where ai-powered search will excel the  most for very specific problems just  this implication alone is huge obviously  if you want to know something political  or something that could have a slant or  bias that's another story  uh it has Google shook a little bit uh  calling a code red and there's a good  reason for that chat GPT is potentially  an existential threat to Google's  business because Google relies 60 of its  revenue on search and chat GPT offers an  alternative to search which is a  One-Stop question answering shop powered  by AI but this could change the game of  search entirely which is core to  Google's business  if open AI integrates a chat gpt-like  language model into Bing search engine  people will just be able to find the  results that they need without having to  scroll through a flat page of search  results that are littered with ads this  may be good news for users but for a  company like Google it's very bad news  and why is this so bad for Google  because roughly 60 percent of their  revenue comes from Google Search  if the magnitude of this income becomes  significantly damaged it could be  catastrophic  Google's business model is centered  around advertising it's been their  long-standing primary source of Revenue  by charging companies for promoted  search links or AdSense links on  websites the company has built a  lucrative business model  but it's clear that chat gpt's  integration with Bing has the potential  to disrupt this entire system  if that doesn't sound bad enough the  creator of Gmail himself said that chat  GPT will destroy Google's business in  two years  while I don't think this is the case  because Google isn't going to just sit  still as you'll soon see it still is  interesting that he said this  in January of 2023 the Department of  Justice filed an Anti-Trust lawsuit  against Google  they stated quote Google has used  anti-competitive exclusionary and  unlawful means to eliminate or severely  diminish any threats to its dominance  over digital advertising Technologies  this isn't to mention the 12 000 Google  employees that were recently let go this  is probably due to higher interest rates  and a changing Market but still all  things considered these are some of the  biggest challenges Google has seen in  its 20 years of dominance so it's no  surprise that the company issued the  code red but here's the crazy thing they  even sought help from their co-founders  Larry Page and Sergey Brin both of which  had stepped down from their executive  positions back in 2019 and have not been  actively involved in the company's  operations according to the New York  Times the pair was invited to an  executive meeting to strategize on how  to integrate chatbot features into  Google search engine they were also said  to be devising a plan for the company's  AI operations  according to Forbes Sergey Brin has  requested access into Google's internal  code and he was taking a look at some  Lambda code this could indicate that  Google will be using Lambda in their  response to open AI  when Google calls them the Old Guard you  know things are getting serious  meanwhile Microsoft is going all out  they're going to be investing an extra  10 billion dollars into open AI  as part of the new agreement Microsoft  will receive 75 percent of open AI  profits until it recoups its investment  and then will hold a 49 stake in the  company afterwards unfortunately this is  the antithesis of what the open AI  company originally stood for  if all goes well this may turn out to be  one of the best business deals of the  decade  right now Chrome is the default option  for Android and Google pays Apple huge  sums of money just to be the default  option on iPhones and Mac OS devices  this has no doubt worked wonders for  Google in the past especially since  there's been no real alternative but now  that Ben could eat some market share I  think Google will use their default  status and dominating market share to  their advantage while they hit back  this is how I think things may play out  if Google gets their act together  so Google are probably going to rapidly  prototype and release an ai-powered  search engine competitor integrated into  Google Chrome and because Google Chrome  is the default browser for so many this  new tool will gain widespread adoption  without much effort and end up killing  being AI before it really gets a chance  to start  now I could be wrong but it just seems  like Google has to make a major move  like this  it's reported that Google is working on  20 AI projects including image  generation tools a product for Prototype  app testing and even a green screen mode  for YouTube creatives  one of the most interesting pieces of  research is music LM an AI that can  transform whistled or humming Melodies  into a certain style which is described  in text  so it's clear that Google isn't sleeping  in a staff memo CEO Sundar pachai wrote  quote I am confident about the huge  opportunity in front of us thanks to the  strength of our mission the value of our  products and services and our early  investments in AI to fully capture it  we'll have to make some tough choices  and I think that last sentence is key it  seems like Google may be forced to put  the safety issues on the back seat and  will just start unleashing the AI  products they could turn the playing  field around quite quickly  and this is some news just in according  to CNBC Google is currently testing a  chat GPT competitor called Apprentice  Bard internally with its employees and  also a group of Engineers have left open  Ai and started their own AI company and  the first product Claude is similar to  chat GPT but better in some cases the  company called anthropic AI has already  raised over one billion dollars and  guess what Google just invested 300  million  things are really heating up now  but for those of you who are really into  technology something doesn't add up here  Google has been working on AI technology  for a long time even as far back as 2016  Google CEO Sundar pachai wanted to make  Google quote an AI first company so how  could they be caught with their pants  down like this  well in a Twist of irony Google  inadvertently gave open AI the keys to  the castle  [Music]  in 2017 Google researchers published a  paper that would silently change the  world it outlined a method of processing  text images and more it was called a  Transformer and their technique allowed  an AI to focus on specific parts of an  input rather than having to process the  entire sequence this allows for more  effective and efficient processing of  language data  so in a way it was this groundbreaking  work from Google scientists that later  led to the development of open ai's chat  GPT  problem for Google is that they moved  too slowly and this was due to safety  concerns and rightly so  such a large company has a lofty  reputation an offensive or misleading AI  would be of high reputational risk for  Google in general even though AI  language models feel very human-like  they occasionally produce a logical or  outright false information and due to  these reasons Google has released  nothing publicly but the unavoidable  consequence was frustrated researchers  so some of them have left to raise money  for their own AI startups  that being said Google does have several  language models for internal use the  most famous of which was Lambda this  language model made headlines in June of  2022 when a former Google engineer  claimed it was sentient while that may  not be true it was certainly  sophisticated  [Music]  so let's wrap this episode up by taking  a look at what we know so far about an  ai-powered Microsoft search engine  Microsoft is expected to launch Bing  with some chat GPT features at the end  of March  there is still some growing speculation  about how the AI system will be  integrated into the search engine  one possibility is that chat GPT could  allow users to just communicate with  Bing in a more human-like way you don't  have to worry about keywords you just  ask Bing the question in the same way  that you would ask another person an  anonymous Microsoft source told  Bloomberg that more conversational and  contextual responses to queries will win  over users by providing better quality  answers that go beyond links Bing is  about to get the features of Dali 2.  that text to image generator that caused  such a stir and kicked off this latest  wave of AI art  this integration will allow users to  type in text and generate images this  feature will be particularly beneficial  for searches where images don't  currently exist essentially it will  allow users to create new images on  demand Microsoft has said that they're  working closely with open AI so this  feature doesn't generate explicit or  inappropriate visuals  so it looks like Bing is getting a major  overhaul with chat GPT and Dali 2  features integrated it sure is going to  grab everyone's attention when it's  launched how exactly this pans out Still  Remains to be seen but I certainly am  intrigued and will be interesting to see  how this plays out  so we may be on the cusp of a new era in  which the search engine that we know  becomes a thing of the past the digital  directories of old will become the  digital assistants of the future so I'm  going to make it clear Google Search  isn't going anywhere anytime soon but  it's so interesting to think that there  could be a legitimate Contender around  the corner and from Microsoft Bing of  all places just think a year or two ago  no one would have seen this coming it's  just amazing how fast things are moving  so what are your thoughts a link based  search result is going to expire do you  think you're going to warm up to an AI  bot serving you the information that you  need well Bing become a verb and finally  do you think Google will hit back faster  than we all expect  please let me know in the comments  section it's going to be an interesting  discussion  alright so that's about it from me feel  free to have a browse through the cold  fusion Channel there's plenty of  interesting topics on AI technology  business and much more  and also don't forget to check out the  chat GPT video linked below so thanks  for watching my name is the gogo and  you've been watching cold fusion and  I'll catch you again soon for the next  episode I'm going to play you out with a  new track I made over on the second  Channel  cheers guys have a good one  [Music]  [Music]  it's me thinking  [Music]
