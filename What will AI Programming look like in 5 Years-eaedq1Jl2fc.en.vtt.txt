 it is December 8th 2022 and you're  watching the code report I've been  trying to warn you about this for years  artificial intelligence is coming to  replace programmers over the last few  days the world has been freaking out  over chat GPT a new demo from openai  that can write and analyze code among  many other things the tool itself is  very impressive but it's not going to  replace programmers it can really only  solve trivial problems like GitHub  copilot and often it provides answers  that are just flat out wrong but look  correct to someone without the proper  domain knowledge it's already been  banned by stack Overflow because the  site has been flooded with people  posting AI answers on topics they know  nothing about more than anything I think  chat GPT is an existential threat to  tools like Google and stack Overflow  because it's a much faster way to get  answers to basic programming problems  what's crazy though is that this is just  a general purpose tool it's not even  designed for programming specifically  now just imagine what will happen when  this technology is focused on replacing  programmers here's how I think it might  play out over the next few years first  AI will start to take over as the  decision maker on your actual machine  Microsoft has already developed codec  CLI to bring AI to the command line  instead of learning Linux in the near  future you should be able to just tell  AI what you want and it will run all the  necessary commands for you automatically  that technology is essentially already  here what I expect to happen next is  that AI will start to build out entire  projects for you based on the  requirements that you give it kind of  like test driven development where all  you do is write some basic testing code  then AI installs all the packages  creates all the files and writes all the  code for you it'll be able to run the  app itself find any errors and correct  them eventually it will get so good that  you don't even have to worry about the  code it writes and this will lead to a  whole new class of artificial  development environments copilot has  already been very successful but it's  just the beginning of this Brave New  World for front end development I would  expect these tools to look kind of like  figma but with extra controls to make  everything interconnected and  interactive to work on any app platform  on the back end we might have something  that looks like a diagram or flowchart  that describes a bunch of API endpoints  or microservices now all of this will be  in integrated into a single environment  allowing the AI to infer the database  models and resources needed to execute  the project and not just make it work  but also optimize it in every way  imaginable in a matter of seconds it  could generate the project in multiple  different languages with multiple  different Frameworks to figure out which  one performs the best actually no it  could create its own brand new  JavaScript framework that is perfectly  optimized for your requirements actually  no why would we even need JavaScript at  that point programming languages are  just for dumb monkeys AI will be able to  write a raw executable straight from  machine code it can come up with its own  perfectly optimized compiler on the Fly  then write comprehensive documentation  about it in any language ultimately what  I think this might lead to is a  universal AI driven programming language  a single deterministic language that  turns every human into a coding God by  simply describing your vision the AI  will figure out how to arrange the ones  and zeros to make it a reality in fact  when we get our neural links we won't  even have to write anything down we can  just think it and it will appear now I  realize neuralink has killed almost all  the monkeys and pigs that have tried it  but when they they open up human trials  in six months I'm gonna be first in line  this language will be so undeniably  powerful that virtually everything else  in the world becomes obsolete overnight  the world will still need Engineers to  solve problems but writing code will not  be one of their responsibilities it'll  become an esoteric skill that only  weirdos take the time to learn kind of  like Celestial navigation I for one  think this is an awesome outcome writing  code is just a means to an end the  reason I learned to write code in the  first place was because I wanted to  build cool stuff if AI can help me build  cool stuff faster without the need to  learn a new JavaScript framework every  week then I will gladly bend the knee on  second thought though it's very possible  that none of this will ever happen I  wouldn't be surprised at all if we're  still writing JavaScript and C plus code  50 years from now this has been the code  report thanks for watching and I will  see you in the next one
