 hi everyone I'm Diane Brady I'm here  with my colleague Kendrick Tai who is a  senior reporter Silicon Valley Kenrick  welcome we're talking I guess chat gbt  and uh all things generative AI this  week based on let's talk a little bit  about the the daily cover that you and  Alex Conrad did starting with  um  are we at a Tipping Point because I feel  like we've had so much news around this  including what you've covered  it just seems like it's escalating  yeah absolutely well thanks for having  me Diane  um I think you know Alex and I we spoke  to 60 plus people in the AI space  Founders investors researchers and  I guess the backdrop with AI is you know  there have been so many hype Cycles in  the past right like uh IBM's deep blue  beating Gary kasparova chess back in uh  1990 age yeah  Generations ago and there's just been  like multiple hype Cycles where it's  like you know this AI is going to you  know take over the world or it's going  to like change the way you work and uh I  think it hasn't really manifested in a  major way uh  in the business side of things  um it's caused a lot of investors to  lose a lot of money because they made  these bets that were speculative and it  really seemed like it was taking off but  then you know the business case didn't  really take off  um but I think what we're seeing now is  that we are at a new Tipping Point  um and things are really starting to  take off I think uh what's really new  about you know this latest AI hype cycle  that's uh different and a lot more  immediate than the past type Cycles is  that  you know it's like kind of the magic is  right in the hands of the consumers you  know like they can just type in a  sentence into a tool like chat gbt or  dolly or stable diffusion and then they  can get you know whole paragraphs answer  or like a whole generation they can do  your essay for you and pass the Wharton  test and everything else you mentioned  other companies so much of the  attention's been on chat GPT and I know  of course you know  um you guys spoke to Sam Altman and open  Ai and such  it's sucking the air out of the room is  it markedly better than everyone else or  are there a lot of players out there  yeah it's uh it's looking very uh very  much too early to tell right now I think  what makes open AI stand out from the  crowd right now is  um a they're just you know the highest  valued company out of the startups in  the space you know their ad thank you  Sachin Adella yeah it's a it's a big  investment reportedly uh so you know  they have that big lead they have you  know a lot of that um from a  metric standpoint they have you know a  lot of computing power from Microsoft  and  that's really kind of made them stand  out uh in terms of getting a lot of  these tools out there but from a  technological standpoint I think it's  still too early to tell like who's  really going to be that winner there  um we spoke for example to Alex Wang at  scale who provides a lot of the  infrastructure tools the picks and  shovels to help these AI model companies  to you know make their models and he was  talking to me about how you know openai  put out this uh tool chat GPT  um this month or I guess this would be  in January  um another company called anthropic  which was founded by a couple of former  open AI researchers they put out their  own uh kind of chatbot tool called  Claude and how does Claude compare to  chat GPT yeah basically what uh scale I  think did like a sort of analysis of  like the two and like  inputting different use cases like who's  better at coding or who's better at  answering like a mathematical question  and what they ended up finding out was  like it was kind of a dead heat you know  it was uh they're both good at their own  things but neither of them was markedly  better than the other and what's really  interesting there is you know open AI  has spent  significantly more money trading chat  GPT than anthropic did Claude so um  basically I think the conclusion there  is it's just way too early to tell like  who is actually going to win this race  um the kind of differentiation between  the models is  relatively similar right now because a  lot of these companies are working with  you know the same buckets of data just  like all the data and that's that's an  interesting point because if you step  back and look at say the race for you  know HIV cure any sort of you know that  that the technology is developing in a  pool and everybody essentially has  access to it so  um it's not like there's a Eureka moment  this really is the culmination of years  and years of research and work that's  been done into like talk a little bit  about some of the other potential  winners in the space you spoke to 60 uh  incredible number of people who are  working here any other companies and  names that emerged from your reporting  sure yeah  um  well I think the big thing to consider  with this whole AI race is that uh  kind of the biggest benefactors right  now are not necessarily these new  companies or not even like a  I guess open AI isn't necessarily an  upstart anymore but they are you know  still one of the newer players in the  arena so far I think the biggest  benefactors have been just a lot of the  cloud providers the uh you know big Tech  folks  um Google and Microsoft and Amazon that  are providing a lot of the computing  power and I think we're starting to see  now that uh these companies are you know  kind of getting a horse into the race in  a  partnering with different companies in  the space and so that provides a big  advantage to certain companies you know  open AI with Microsoft we were reporting  on stability AI who has a very deep  partnership with Amazon  um where  they have some kind of arrangement where  Amazon provided stability with  more than 4 000 Nvidia gpus like these  AI chips that put together kind of  created one of the world's biggest  supercomputers for stability to run  their models on so um  this really popular image generation  tool called stable diffusion  um  was uh really made possible and Powerful  by that partnership  um besides that I think we are  seeing just a lot of new companies  starting to emerge  um one of the big kind of uh  offshoot points  um was this paper that a bunch of Google  researchers put out in 2017 called  attention is all you need and it  basically uh invented this new paradigm  um  for  it's called the Transformer that uh is  kind of a new machine learning approach  that has kind of made this whole  generative boom kind of possible  um and I guess it was just a really  great technological breakthrough and  what we've seen now is like six of the  eight researchers on that paper have  left to start their own AI companies and  a lot of those are some of the most  promising companies right now so you  have companies like cohere and Adept and  character AI  uh but what space are they working and  when you talk about those companies um I  mean  are they are they basically um working  on specific use cases for gender of AI  is it sort of helping to develop the  technology further or where would you  say the general neighborhood is  yeah it's a good question  um I think for some of those com so I  think there's two different categories  and for some of the companies I was just  mentioning open AI stability cohere  Adept uh they're creating kind of the  models the kind of base layers  um  that uh you know that these new AI  breakthroughs are coming from so  one example being  um catch EBT the underlying basis is you  know something called GPT which is a  um sort of text generation model and  then we're talking about uh stable  diffusion earlier which is a sort of  text to image model  um and then there are these kind of  other like models that are  um  being developed and that's kind of like  the uh foundational layer for all this  AI but then what we're also seeing is  all these applications that are being  built on top of the AI models so  I think something popular example might  be like lenza the uh kind of selfie app  that uh  you just  uh upload a selfie of yourself and then  it kind of generates all these like  really cool outlandish uh  selfies of you  um on a more sophisticated basis than we  can already do with like dog ears and  tongues and such obviously yeah  absolutely it'll like make you look like  a uh astronaut or like a medieval  warrior or something like that check  that out my new my new profile let me  ask you know one of the things what  happened let's say with Cloud was it did  really sort of provide  um a foundation for this whole zero  marginal cost economy where you saw this  explosion of new businesses that were  able to be created I think I'm still  curious as to whether this is really  reinforcing the power of the Titans or  if we're seeing another  opportunity here where we it will  unleash new creativity new startups  probably a bit of both but what sense  are you getting  yeah I'd say uh it's a big question that  I was trying to get a sense of from  talking to all these people and it  really does seem like the jury is still  out but uh  I think to some extent like this does  most likely uh bolster the power of the  Titans um kind of going back to for a  while and like the uh  Computing cost of all this you know the  these Cloud providers tend to just  benefit a lot from  um  you know powering these AI uh  this AI in the first place  um I think another thing that makes this  AI Paradigm Shift different from certain  other Paradigm shifts is that uh a lot  of this technology is very easy to  integrate like even with something like  lenza that's a totally new app that's  built on top of um  stable diffusion  um the image generation model that we  were talking about earlier and that was  you know pretty relatively easy to kind  of just like  integrate that  into an app and kind of just put this  app out there and they're making like at  their Peak according to um  this company sensor tower that uh  tracks like app store data they're  making like 2.5 million dollars at a  single day at their Peak just wow  quickly uploading uh it's like Angry  Birds territory right yeah  um I think that kind of speaks to the  point to your question of like the big  Tech  um for them like a it's like  even easier to be able to kind of  integrate this technology and then you  know with companies like and use it as a  service offering in essence like as part  of an Enterprise package here now we've  got this you can do a b and c yeah  potentially I mean  um this kind of feels very new in that  uh this technology is kind of blowing up  in these last couple months but uh  Google has had like a AI arm for 15 plus  years that you know employs thousands of  people and uh they have this technology  kind of and a lot of it has been behind  the scenes  um we're starting to see it a little bit  like if you use Gmail there's like smart  composed where it'll like automatically  suggest like the next here's what you  really want to say to your mother right  that kind of thing well well let me you  know one of the things that I think um  in terms of the Zeitgeist there is the  Euphoria fear Nexus and it feels like at  this point the economy is down so  there's job loss and there's concern  about what the job gains going to look  like now that we've got these new tools  there's already concern about deep fakes  and Trust on the internet and now we've  got these tools in general  um what is what is the reaction around  the use cases I mean we're already  seeing AI generated you know Seinfeld  like comedies and as I mentioned  programs that are passing tests that  Wharton it does inspire a certain degree  of fear as to where the human is in the  equation what are you sensing in terms  of what the repercussions are of that  yeah that's a that's a very interesting  existential  existed I think uh I mean to kind of tie  a bow out of your previous question too  like we're seeing and what we're  probably going to see like first before  anything gets you know to Bonkers is uh  just the application of these AI uh  breakthroughs to business tools so I  think we'll see like more and more like  for example Microsoft integrating into  word and Outlook or um  chat Bots chat Bots uh the different  tools that Google has and that you know  meta can apply this AI to Facebook  um and we'll probably see it more and  more in uh business use cases like that  different productivity tools and things  like that but um I think what you're  touching on as the potential existential  threat is uh very much something that uh  people are starting to think about and  be concerned about and uh  you start to be thoughtful about  Universal basic income comes back into  the conversation perhaps as we look at  jobs coming back  um any thoughts from the regulatory  front I mean is this when we talk about  a Tipping Point  um you know it does that that implies  that we are in a sort of new playing  field and a new level of Interest what  what are we tipping into  yeah  um a lot of a lot of unanswered  questions I think I mean even to the  existential Threat all right there's  this uh term called artificial general  intelligence uh AGI which kind of  um stands for uh this sort of  hypothetical future AI that is sentient  and like self-conscious and  um kind of gets to all the Sci-Fi  Promises of like what AI could be right  Comfort your dad or start a war it  depends yeah  um and I think one of the really  interesting takeaways from all the  reporting that Alex and I did uh Alex  was talking to Sam Altman at openai who  one of their company missions or their  primary mission is to kind of build  towards this AGI and what Altman was  telling us was um  it's quite possible that when we get  there to full AGI like we won't even  recognize that we've already gotten  there  um so there are a lot of like kind of  interesting  repercussions or potential like  exciting things that happen out of that  um up and was saying like that's the  type of thing that could potentially you  know break capitalism it could be  something that like you said like  reintroduces this whole Universal basic  income thing to the equation  um  I think before we get that there are a  lot of like just legal questions to be  figured out you know like on a some of  them are kind of more  more on a very like basic regulatory  front like  what is the um  what are IP rules here what are the  copyright rules for this whole new  paradigm shift you know like open Ai and  Microsoft have been sued for purportedly  kind of  by reading um quote unquote uh  like programmers code and similarly like  stability has a lawsuit from getting  images for  supposedly or allegedly kind of stealing  all these images off of Getty servers  and kind of using it we have to teach  the program morals perhaps you know one  of the things that has come up of course  is just the whole nature of algorithmic  bias you know I I and and some people  have experimented with how they describe  say Biden versus Trump or you know write  me a poem and and  um how much is that from just to kind of  you know tie this up from where you said  as somebody who's covering this  um what are the questions that you have  in your mind both  and the concerns and the opportunities  let's start with the questions you have  coming out of this exercise of  essentially doing a deep dive on  something we're just hearing about  you know bits and pieces every week  yeah totally  um I think it would be two things  um one of them is like how do we resolve  these issues of um bias inaccuracy which  are still you know very much still there  I think they were  they've been kind of a hot debate Point  as far as this AI technology goes for  for years but uh just because we've  reached this kind of Tipping Point uh  from a business standpoint doesn't mean  those issues have been resolved yet and  um from talking to some of the folks uh  for for this story you know we found  like  when chat GPT writes a job description  there are still elements of uh  bias in there and uh interesting  takeaway from a conversation with uh  Kieran Snyder who is a CEO of a company  called uh textio I think which kind of  is a recruiting startup  um but she inputted like some of these  uh job descriptions into chat GPT and  some of the most compelling like uh  job recruiting descriptions were the  ones that had the most bias so you know  it's still very much an issue there and  it's still very much an issue also in  terms of like what is accurate right  like if you type something into uh  chat gbt  um it'll very confidently like give you  an answer but the answer might not  necessarily be the correct answer so um  people in the AI space call that kind of  hallucination and there's still a lot of  this like AI hallucinating giving you  these like answers that if you take at  face value they could like kind of screw  up your business or kind of screw up  your uh homework fire everybody right  well we uh We've certainly seen examples  of that without a machine operated tool  I mean  um  yeah sorry to interrupt but uh I think  the second thing is just like the more  uh long-term existential question that  we were kind of touching on earlier  um I think kind of as far as regulations  and as far as like who is making the  decisions go uh we're just barely at the  uh at the start of that  um we could see like kind of a  2010s type of you know all these  Congressional hearings with these social  media companies um we saw how that went  yeah and talking to some of these  researchers in the AI space uh it seems  like that could very much be a similar  thing that will happen with certain AI  companies where they'll need to answer  to different regulations in different  places uh we spoke to a researcher at  Harvard uh Aviv ovadia who said you know  kind of we need policy making at the  speed of you know this technology and  um that's because you know this could  have really big  um impacts on  just the way that you know basic core  tenants of our democracy like free  speech and you know  dissemination of Truth or information  like how that stuff is affected like at  a very onerous hypothetical like these  things could be used to generate like  fake videos of you know a violent Riot  happening or something like that right  which which is which is interesting I  mean one of the things  um you know two other points I think are  worth touching on right now one is that  you know as we're saying this there is a  alleged you know Chinese uh a balloon  that's you know it's buying us we've  seen conversations about Tick Tock and  Congress you know obviously there's a  lot of innovation happening right now in  China you've got the regulatory  environment in Europe let's step outside  the U.S I know this wasn't the focus of  your story but how much is what are we  ahead of the curve or are we really sort  of operating in parallel especially with  China where there's so much Innovation  we haven't been talking about  yeah it's a it's a good question  um  to be determined perhaps because again  it's not the most transparent of places  when it comes to that I do think a lot  of it is to be determined but uh China  is very much a  prolific  um threat or competitor however you want  to perceive that  um as far as this race goes  um I think there have been statistics  out about how  China has now lapped the US in terms of  the uh amount of AI research papers that  are coming out of China versus coming  out of the United States and um  you know there's very much a kind of  wild garden situation uh where China is  developing its own set of AI  Technologies and the US is developing  our own set of AI Technologies and so  it's still kind of TBD like where that's  going to go but uh I think there's very  much a big question there that is like  causing  um  US government for example to kind of  start looking at Silicon Valley deeper  and deeper you know whereas like China  very much  they're kind of figuring out their own  strategies like this AI chips act for  example that Biden uh put forth that  kind of uh  could be a damper for China's efforts  you know not being able to acquire so  many Nvidia chips anymore but uh I think  you know they have their own kind of  plays that are uh  still coming and one other question  Kenrick which is um you know there's a  certain kind of orwellian Fear Factor  tone I know that has been certainly in  the headlines  um but in Silicon Valley I also think  there must be a lot of conversation  around the opportunity the excitement  especially in Realms like Health Care  Etc  what what is the general tone you're  hearing and where do you think are the  particular pockets of excitement that we  should watch in terms of how this plays  out and how it can transform certain  industries  yeah totally I think um  I think it's the the overall sentiment  in Silicon Valley around this technology  is like uh  very excited one  um I mean I feel like all the  conversations that I was having at the  end of uh 2022 with investors was just  like he's you know onerous times as far  as the market goes and then now we're  looking at what's happening in AI  investment and it's as if uh  it's as if this uh this Market were not  the way it was you know it's as if like  everything was still a year a new day  right yeah but I think like that kind of  the reason for that is because  um kind of this AI has gotten to that  Tipping Point where  um people are starting to imagine all  sorts of things that uh  that could completely change you know  the way that we work or the way that we  live you know and I think the most  exciting companies to come out of this  technology probably have not been  founded yet and you know are probably in  use cases that uh  we haven't really seen the AI touch yet  you know like I think the most exciting  places are like healthcare or education  you know and just like thinking about  um  a kind of basic like next step example  right like can chat GPT get to the point  where it can be a  personalized one-on-one therapist or  personalized one-on-one tutor something  like that but um you know we're seeing  like a lot of developments in drug  Discovery and like figuring out how to  cure different uh diseases and  um I think there are a lot of promising  ways that this technology is going to  just really supercharge  um  hopefully benefits for Humanity uh on  the other hand guardrails are necessary  to make sure exciting days to come this  is no doubt the year of generative Ai  and look forward to continuing the  conversation thanks for joining us  Kendrick thanks so much for having me  Diane
