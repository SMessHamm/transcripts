 in the last couple of months a new AI  chatbot called chat GPT has been taking  the Internet by storm because it can do  anything you ask it to do within reason  need to write an email you can use that  ask the chat bot and it'll write it for  you want a cool picture of yourself  riding on a unicorn on the moon you can  have ai do it now need an SEO optimized  blog for a keyword you can have ai write  it but is artificial intelligence truly  the future of marketing or is it simply  a phase we'll dig it into that and more  on this episode  [Music]  welcome back to the honest marketing  podcast where you learn proven  strategies to grow your business without  selling your soul I'm your host Travis  Albritton and today we're talking about  artificial intelligence the new chatbot  chat GPT and what it means for the  future of marketing now if you're not  aware chat GPT is a prototype artificial  intelligence chat bot developed by the  group called open AI which specializes  in dialogue and this is not too  dissimilar from other chat Bots that you  may be familiar with if you message a  Facebook page for instance and it has an  automated chat function built into it  that gives you different responses based  on the answers and the things that you  say that is a chat bot if you use  any kind of support request AI where  they have automated responses you say  okay well how can I help you today and  you say I need help with billing and  then it says okay well here are the  three top results for billing is that  what you want is that what you're  looking for click one of these links  that is a form of AI chat chat EPT just  takes us to a whole other level because  you can type any prompt something like  write a short email on the importance of  connecting with your customers and it  will actually spit out an email for you  an actual email that you can copy and  paste into your CRM and so what makes  chat GPT different or a big step forward  is its versatility and the things you  can ask it so some of the more uh you  know interesting things is people are  saying hey I need to solve this using  python code and then chatgpt will  actually create that code for you you  can copy and paste in it's pretty crazy  uh and this technology has certainly  existed in other places uh jarvis.ai is  a good example for copywriters a lot of  marketers use that for for doing  headlines and blog posts and social  media captions and things like that so  it's not a new thing it's not a new  phenomenon but this version of AI speech  has certainly taken simulated human  interaction to a whole other level  so what does this mean is it a tool  that's useful not useful what are the  pros and cons of using it and what does  this ultimately mean for marketing well  first let's cover three things that chat  GPT in particular does exceptionally  well and the first one is that it gives  you the answer you're looking for in the  format that you ask for it what an  amazing concept right you go to the  internet and say hey I need help with X  and the internet actually gives you x uh  you know my my favorite funny story  regarding this kind of AI interaction is  always Siri because I'll ask Siri  something and unless it's a very  specific formatted question  within a list of things that I know it  can do it will typically just say I just  searched Google and here is the response  here's the results that I found not  actually answering the question  and so you know and that can kind of be  the experience of using a lot of these  AI chats is okay I didn't really  understand what you asked me so here's a  bunch of other stuff that you know  hopefully maybe it's relevant  and it's not typically in the format  you're asking for either  but with chat gbt you can ask it for  very specific things like create uh an  acrostic poem about email marketing and  it'll actually do that it'll actually  create one it'll generate one and give  it to you that you can copy and paste  and you can use if you're into that kind  of thing and so it gives you the answer  you're looking for in the format you're  asking for it in which is really  powerful because then that allows you to  then take that as a starting place and  to iterate on that for whatever project  you have whether that's blogs whether  that's email copywriting social media  captions whatever it is a script for  video for an episode of a Podcast chat  CPT is capable of doing all those things  and doing them relatively well for an AI  chatbot  there are some finicky things you have  to be mindful of and we'll cover that in  a second but it's actually much better  than any other chatbot that I've used  number two is it can create a first  draft of any written project so going  back to giving it in the format you  asked for if you ask for a blog post  it'll give you a blog post if you ask  for an email it'll give you an email if  you ask for a social media caption it'll  give you that and so whenever you're  starting a new project the hardest part  is starting it's getting words on paper  it's staring at that blank screen and  getting something down that you can then  go back cut up rearrange move around and  iterate on and make better so with chat  GPT you can just say hey here's the  prompt here's the thing that I'm looking  to do and then use chat GPT to create  that first draft that you can then edit  make your own and use in whatever kind  of marketing collateral that you want to  and then the number three thing that's  pretty awesome about chat EBT is it's  free it's free to use now the way they  make money open AI is they Source their  technology to businesses that want to  use it  um you know for their own purposes  but the chat feature this chat bot in  particular is free and so if you've  looked at platforms like jarvis.ai which  is probably gonna have to shift your bit  their business model now uh that chat  GPT is here  and you've just not really loved the  idea of paying for a chat bot to do some  of these things for you chat GPT is free  to use so you can experiment it if you  like it great if not you didn't spend  any money on it so those are three  things that chat CPT does exceptionally  well being a dialogue focused chat bot  as in you ask a question you give it a  prompt and it gives you an answer or a  response  so let's talk about some areas where  chat GPT in particular and and really  all chat based AI really struggle the  first one is factual accuracy factual  accuracy so you can ask chat GPT to do  something like write a YouTube script  for a video about the iPhone 14 for  example  and it'll write you a script for a  YouTube video on the iPhone 14. but then  more often than not what you'll find as  you read through them is a lot of the  facts are wrong like it'll say hey it's  got a 12 megapixel main camera when it  actually has a 48 megapixel main camera  uh MKBHD over on YouTube actually did a  breakdown on uh his experience using it  and that was one of the things that he  discovered was  there's a lot of facts that gets wrong  in creating these kind of responses and  that's because chat GPT doesn't know  what's a true fact and what isn't and so  when it's looking out on the internet  for the information it needs to compile  the answer to respond to your prompt it  can't decipher between what is true and  what is not true what is an accurate  fact and what is inaccurate because  everything is is neutral right it's just  information on the internet that it's  consuming in order to deliver a response  and so what you'll find  is that if you write things that have  more Nuance or more subjectivity and how  you're writing it or crafting it or  using it then chat GPT is going to  struggle with that is going to struggle  with knowing how to parse between two  different sets of facts and knowing  which one is right and which one is  wrong and so that's where you have to  know that the information you're getting  back is actually true uh and so you you  definitely want to be mindful of that  because you don't want to post something  as your business and have it be  factually inaccurate that would be not  great  and then the number two thing that it  struggles with is plagiarism  imagine that a chat bot that's combing  the internet for answers struggles with  not plagiarizing uh and that's because  it learns by looking through different  places on the internet where people  interact and have dialogue and uses that  to learn how to interact with people on  its own platform  um you know so famously it was scraping  through Twitter until Elon Musk said you  know what if you're gonna look at  Twitter to gain information to help you  optimize your chatbot you should pay for  that but that's what it does it just  kind of scrapes through the internet it  looks for uh dialogue it looks for  comments it looks for interactions and  conversations and information that I can  then use to answer prompts on its own  platform  but there's no  at least at this point a sense that the  chatbot has any inclination to give  credit where credit is due and how it  comes up with those answers because  at the end of the day most people right  now are just kind of using it for fun  and not to uh write a essay that's fact  checked and  um you know not given to plagiarism  and it just sees information and spits  that information out and so if you're  leaning on it to create something know  that more than likely there's a good  amount of it that's going to be  plagiarized from somewhere else copy and  paste it in reformatted based on the  format that you give in the prompt  and so those are the two ways that chat  GPT and other AI really struggle when it  comes to answering these kinds of things  is getting the facts right and  plagiarizing  and so when I think about the future of  marketing and our AI chatbots like chat  GPT the future  yes in a sense AI chat Bots like chat  gbt will continue to get better they're  going to continue to be more refined  they're going to continue to learn and  become a valuable tool  for companies and marketers but that  word tool is very important in the same  way that a hammer is a valuable tool if  you're trying to build a house but  human curated and created content will  become more valuable as a result and  just think about it in a sea of internet  created content  when you see a graphic or a piece of  artwork that's created by AI you think  man that's really cool  but it has no value because you know  that it was just an algorithm that spits  something out  but when you see something that was  created by a person  it's like wow that's really Incredible  or to make it more real world  you can buy a real authentic Louis  Vuitton purse for I don't know two  thousand five thousand dollars somewhere  in that range  or you can buy a knockoff that costs 40  bucks at your local flea market  which one is more valuable which one is  which one carries more value in your  eyes  the real deal right if you have the  authentic one that is you know 100  authentic from the actual company Louis  Vuitton you hold that in high honor and  and give a lot of value to it and when  other people see it that gives you a  sense of esteem social esteem  if you have a knockoff that looks 95 the  same  but it's not the real deal it is  less valuable that's why you can buy it  for 40 bucks  and so when you think about AI chat Bots  AI generated content on the internet I  think ultimately long term what's going  to happen is that it's going to become a  great tool to launch written word  projects and graphics and things like  that but  for businesses that really want to do  exceptional work it can only be a  starting point it's not going to replace  your marketing team it's not going to  replace your graphics Department it's  not going to replace your social media  managers  because at the end of the day you still  need a person  who is filtering through the content  anything that the AI chat spits out and  making it relevant and making sure that  it's to the Quality that you expect for  your business  and so  as a result of that  you know people are going to really  start to Value human made things  and as AI begins proliferating the  internet because more people take  advantage of these tools that become  more common people will start to expect  it people will know what to look for to  know if something is generated by a chat  bot or not  then authentic human connection will  become more valuable not less and if you  can position your business as being  human or more human then people will see  your brand as being more trustworthy  because they know that they're  interacting with a person or they're  reading words written by a person or  they're looking through graphics and  portfolio images made by people at your  company and that's going to give them  the trust that you know they're they're  really getting a person on the other end  of this transaction whatever that looks  like for your business that has them in  mind that they're not interacting with  some algorithm but an actual person  and that is when you can really elevate  your business to be at the top end of  your industry you know not the wish of  your industry but the apple of your  industry and people put a lot of trust  in that and so the more you can build  that in to what you're doing the more  that you can have a human right your  emails have a human create your social  media posts have a person interact in  support the more valuable that becomes  and just on that note as we kind of wrap  up this episode  think about the times you've interacted  with the company's uh you know customer  support whether you're calling in on a  phone or interacting via email  it's a very different experience  when you're trying to get an answer and  you're having to argue with a phone tree  of chat Bots right where you call in and  they have a pre-recorded response and  you're pressing numbers and you're  trying to get down to like okay this is  actually the thing that I need and  you're hopefully eventually going to  connect me with a person that can help  me solve that problem  versus a company that you call and  within three seconds a person picks up  the phone that can solve your problem  that experience is wildly different one  is cheaper on the front end for the  business to fulfill but on the back end  the experience for the customer  the one that actually talks to a human  in real time  immediately that's a much more highly  valued interaction and so the more human  you can be the more you can lean into  the humanity of the people in your  business as it you connect with and  interact with your customers the more  trust people will have in your business  the more you'll be seen as authentic as  being you know honest and having great  morals and great integrity and  the more that you will build Goodwill  with the people that interact with you  that will give you more of the benefit  of the doubt they will trust you more  and that in itself builds longevity into  your business because you can separate  yourself simply by being human in an  internet full of  knockoffs and AI  as trying to imitate humans all right so  chat GPT pretty cool tool but at the end  of the day it's not going to replace you  it's not going to replace your marketing  team and don't use it as anything more  than a tool  if you really want to continue to be  honest in your marketing up front with  who you are what you do and how you want  to serve people that's my two cents you  can take it or leave it if you uh leave  it and think I'm insane and crazy make  sure you leave a comment in the YouTube  video version of this episode love to  hear your thoughts and interact with you  there uh but thanks for listening to my  musings on chat and AI hope you have a  fantastic week and as always be honest  foreign
