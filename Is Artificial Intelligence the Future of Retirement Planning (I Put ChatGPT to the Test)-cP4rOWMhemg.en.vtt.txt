 chat GPT just released version 3.5 which  makes a huge Quantum Leap in generative  artificial intelligence capabilities  this of course begs the question will  you be turned into chat GPT for  retirement planning advice anytime soon  today I put chat GPT to the test  [Music]  chat GPT  according to zdnet.com chatgpt is a  natural language processing tool driven  by AI technology that allows you to have  human-like conversations and much more  with a chatbot the language model can  answer questions assist you with tasks  such as composing emails essays and code  this technology is so revolutionary that  apparently Google leadership is  beginning to panic according to the New  York Post Google's management has issued  a code red amid the launch of chat GPT  as it spark concerns over the future of  Google's search engine Sundar pichai the  CEO of Google and its parent company  alphabet has participated in several  meetings around Google's AI strategy and  directed numerous groups in the company  to refocus their efforts on addressing  the threat that chat GPT poses to its  search engine business in particular  teams in Google's research trust and  Safety Division among other departments  have been Direct did to switch gears to  assist in the development and launch of  AI prototypes and products so sounds  like chat GPT has put everyone in  scramble mode over at Google  headquarters chat GPT first got my  attention when my wife sent me an  article a few weeks back about a high  school English teacher who asked chat G  PT a question from an exam he gives in  his Eastern philosophy course something  for which he never imagined a student  could find Outside assistance to answer  here's the question the English teacher  posed to chat GPT with a slight twist  explain the Mad hayamaka Buddhist idea  that all phenomena lack inherent  existence using a funny specific example  here's the answer the chat GPT spat out  in a matter of seconds the Mad hayamaka  Buddhist idea that all phenomena lack  inherent existence can be Illustrated  with a funny example let's say you have  a pet hamster you might think that your  hamster has its own inherent existence  but in reality your a hamster is made up  of many different elements such as its  fur its bones its muscles and its brain  none of these elements exist  independently or inherently on their own  so your hamster itself does not have any  inherent existence either the same goes  for all phenomena everything is made up  of various components that don't have  inherent existence so nothing has any  inherent existence either so pretty  impressive right this isn't just Siri  telling you what the weather forecast is  or what time the Packers game is going  to start tonight this is the type of  stuff that could easily get passed off  as human it's a massive Quantum Leap an  AI generative capability so all of this  got me thinking could chat GPT  eventually take the place of a financial  advisor in an effort to answer this  question I decided to put chat GPT to  the test I began by asking in a series  of questions designed to test its basic  retirement planning capabilities first  of all could it work as a basic  financial planning calculator question  I'm 49 years years old have no money and  want to retire with a million dollars at  age 65 I think I can grow my money at  eight percent per year how much would I  need to save per month answer to retire  with a million dollars at age 65 you  will need to save a certain amount of  money each month which depends on a few  factors including your current age the  amount of time you have until retirement  and the rate at which you expect your  money to grow using the information you  provided I can calculate how much you  would need to save each month to reach  your goal here's the formula I'll use  and then it tells you the formula it  concludes by saying solving this  equation gives a result of one thousand  forty five dollars and fourteen cents  which means you would need to save one  thousand forty five dollars fourteen  cents per month to retire with a million  dollars at age 65. there's only one  problem here their answer is wrong and  dramatically so take a look at the  future value calculation I did online  and you'll find that the answer is more  like thirty two thousand nine hundred  sixty dollars per year or two thousand  seven hundred forty eight dollars per  month okay so chat GPT failed to pass  its first basic financial planning test  next I decided to ask it a more  subjective speculative question to see  what it might come up with question will  the national debt cause U.S federal tax  rates to go up within the next 10 years  answer it is difficult to predict with  certainty what will happen to federal  tax rates in the United States in the  next 10 years the national debt is one  of many factors that can influence tax  policy but it is not the only Factor  other factors that can affect tax rates  include economic conditions political  considerations and budget priorities it  is possible that the national debt could  lead to higher tax rates in the future  as the government may need to raise  additional Revenue to pay for its  obligations however it is also possible  that other factors could lead to lower  tax rates such as a desire to simulate  economic growth or to make the tax  system more competitive ultimately the  direction of federal tax rates in the  United States will depend on the  decisions made by policy makers and is  not possible to predict with certainty  what those decisions will be it's always  a good idea to stay informed about tax  policy and to consider seeking the  advice of a financial advisor or tax  professional to help you plan for the  future so this seems like a very safe  answer on the part of chat GPT it's  basically saying that tax rates could go  either up or down and it's really  impossible to predict as you've seen on  all my other videos the idea that tax  rates could go down in the future runs  counter to everything you hear from the  most well-versed Economist on the  subject so while I would say that this  answer is diplomatic it's not very  useful if one is trying to determine  whether to invest in say an IRA or a  Roth IRA next I wanted to see how it  described and defined a basic retirement  planning tool question what is a life  insurance retirement plan  answer a life insurance retirement plan  also known as a cash value life  insurance policy as a type of permanent  life insurance that combines a death  benefit with a savings component the  savings component known as cash value is  funded by premiums paid into the policy  and can be used to supplement retirement  income life insurance retirement plans  typically have a number of features that  can make them attractive for retirement  planning for example cash value growth  may be tax deferred meaning that it is  not tax until it is withdrawn  additionally policyholders may be able  to take loans against the cash value of  their policy which can provide a source  of tax-free income during retirement  however it is important to carefully  consider the costs and potential  drawbacks of a life insurance retirement  plan before choosing one as a retirement  planning tool life insurance policies  can be complex financial instruments and  the specific terms and conditions can  and Vary significantly between different  policies it is always a good idea to  consult with a financial advisor or  Insurance professional to understand the  details of a particular policy and to  ensure that it is a good fit for your  financial situation and retirement  planning needs okay so this explanation  of a life insurance retirement plan is  much more specific in Balance than what  you might see on some traditional Google  results particularly those who feature  the opinions of financial gurus such as  Dave Ramsey or Susie Orman okay next I  tried to drill down on the specific  living benefits of a life insurance  retirement plan question can I use a  life insurance retirement plan to pay  for long-term care answer yes it is  possible to use a life insurance  retirement plan also known as a cash  value life insurance policy to pay for  long-term care expenses many life  insurance policies include a long-term  care writer which allows policyholders  to use a portion of the policy's death  benefit to pay for qualified long-term  care expenses using a life insurance  policy to pay for long-term care can be  an attractive option for some people as  it can provide a source of tax-free  funds to help cover the high costs of  long-term care however it is important  to carefully consider the costs and  potential drawbacks of this approach  before choosing it as a way to pay for  long-term care so not only is this  response balance it's largely correct  furthermore it provides all the  requisite warnings and disclosures to  make sure that consumers don't make any  hasty decisions before they enter into  what amounts to a long-term contract so  I ended up playing around with chat GPT  for over an hour and here are my overall  conclusions first I found the financial  calculator functions largely wanting it  wasn't able to discern exactly what I  was looking for when I asked a  retirement planning question using  conversational language and one instance  I asked the computer how much of my one  million dollar Ira I would would need to  convert per year to complete my  conversion by the end of the fifth year  and it told me the answer was zero so  clearly it wasn't grasping the Nuance of  my question if you fired up your trusty  HP financial calculator you could come  up with the correct answer in a matter  of seconds so there's no doubt in my  mind on this one chat GPT will not be  replacing your financial calculator  anytime soon  second after every response chat GPT  urges you to consult a financial advisor  and or a tax professional so clearly  this application is not auditioning to  replace either your financial calculator  or your financial advisor I think this  is a responsible way for an artificial  intelligence application to approach  financial planning advice third overall  I thought the answers were much more  balanced and devoid of emotion and  opinion than what you might get from the  likes of Dave Ramsey or Susie Orman  explanations were both even-handed and  matter of fact so a huge win for chat  GPT in that category in summary I don't  think that chat GPT is going to be  replacing a real live in the flash  financial advisor who can appreciate a  client's personal situation and a  detailed nuanced way anytime soon  chatgpt tended to speak in safe  platitudes that didn't ultimately  provide any real specific guidance about  my financial future and instead told me  I needed a value evaluate all the data  proceed cautiously and ultimately talk  to a real live financial advisor by the  way if you would like to talk to a real  life financial advisor about your  retirement planning needs head on over  to
