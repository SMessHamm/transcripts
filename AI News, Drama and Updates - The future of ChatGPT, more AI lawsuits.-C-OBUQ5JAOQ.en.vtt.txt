 hey everyone welcome back to another  episode of AI news drama and updates uh  we're going to be talking about the  happenings of the AI world that have  taken place towards the end of January  here uh we're gonna be talking a little  bit about chat GPT a little bit about  open AI Microsoft and a couple of other  things that have taken place in the AI  space  all right so one of the first things I  want to talk about today is open Ai and  chat GPT professional which is something  I hinted at in the last video we're  talking about the future of chat gbt in  which it's not going to be a free  service for everyone to just kind of use  willy-nilly I think we all saw this  coming it's a very expensive thing to  run something so powerful as this data  model for chat GPT Microsoft is getting  involved in trying to find a way to  monetize it for themselves and integrate  this into their stuff however with all  that said this isn't going to be just  under Microsoft's umbrella it looks like  openai chat GPT it's not going to be  exclusive to Microsoft even in the  future or at least that's what's planned  right now and looking at some of what  they're offering here it's basically an  always available faster version of the  service without any slowdown I've never  really had any of the blackout stuff or  any of that other stuff going on that  maybe other people have experienced but  I haven't probably used it nearly as  much as other people as I was looking  through chat GPT stuff another thing  that I came across that I thought was  very interesting is a story about a  woman who used chat GPT to decide  whether or not she should leave her  husband so you could see very important  decisions being made in the world of AI  as it looks the woman was having some  difficulties in her marriage asked chat  GPT to kind of write out a story what  chat GPT thinks she should do and uh I  guess she executed so for anyone  interested chat GPT uh played out the  rest of the story and suggested that she  and the marriage so she did she's now  living happily with her lover having  left her marriage so  that's that's that I'm curious what your  thoughts are on something like that be  sure to leave them in the comments below  now we're talking more and more about  chat GPT so there are now open source  Alternatives that are starting to emerge  the problem is that chat gbt and the  concepts that run it are massively  powerful you need mega systems to run it  I mean we're talking about hundreds and  hundreds of GPU video cards a100 not  even things that you can easily access  as a consumer so it's not going to be  something that people are going to be  easily able to run at home but of course  as this becomes more and more prevalent  we're going to see less and less  requirements needed to run it we're also  going to start to see soon AI chips  right now a lot of these systems are  running on gpus which are not  necessarily ideal they're just very very  fast processors they're meant for  something very different though and  there is actually invented AI chips  chips that are made specifically to do  this type of processing so as we start  to see those types of things become more  and more available become potentially  consumer products we're going to  probably see things like this become  more viable potentially there's also the  aspect though that other companies are  going to want to sell this to you so the  idea of having you be able to do this at  home for free  you're going to have to find companies  that want to allow you to do that rather  than sell it to you and that's going to  be tough in this economic landscape  Switching gears from chat GPT and  talking about stability Ai and going  back into the world of AI art the newest  version upcoming of stable diffusion  stable diffusion 3 that they did  officially announce that they're going  to allow artists to opt out of this  um I've already made my thoughts pretty  clear on this this is not actually  something that's required in my opinion  it's my opinion that in the current  landscape in the current models that  exist current artists are not actually  as required as they feel that they are a  lot of artists of course are feeling  some kind of way about having their art  immediately integrated into models I can  understand that I would personally  prefer that it doesn't get integrated  because most people's art isn't going to  be something that's going to benefit the  model in most cases  regardless moving forward we're looking  towards a future where artists will be  able to pick and choose what art will be  allowed to be part of the model what art  won't there are some concerns in terms  of the way things work currently if  you're an artist trying to remove your  art from the models there's some issues  with how to actually go about doing that  and of course you don't actually need to  prove that you own the art to remove it  from the model which is of course its  own version of uh trouble ours Technica  and a couple of other Publications have  gone through the process of actually  pretending to be an artist and having  something removed from models and the  tools that exist they're not ideal not  yet  um but you know this is one of many AI  things that I think in the future we're  going to see uh we're gonna see this  honed into a new process but what I will  say that this is is an example of  stability doing more than they should or  more than they absolutely need to  um they're absolutely not legally  required to do any of this this is  something that they're doing just simply  to address the concerns of the public  copyright and of course copyright law is  only going to protect actual copies and  since nothing is being copied in the  latent diffusion this is again a very  optional thing for stability to do good  on them for doing it I think it weakens  their position for future arguments  though  but because artists are just so intense  here's a great example of something that  I wanted to share and I already shared  this one on Twitter so for those who do  follow me they probably have already  seen this but this is an artist who was  banned from Reddit in the art subreddit  specifically because their art looked as  if it was AI generated turns out it was  not and the mod that actually banned  them uh did so with some some Choice  words explaining that they need to  change their style in the future or  other people are going to make the same  mistake so clearly it was this artist's  fault for having art that looked too  much like what other art looks like  nowadays and it got them banned and  basically artists are now infighting  amongst each other because they don't  know what is real  now that said that's actually no  different than the world of art before  AI art existed turns out uh because if  you were a tracer or a photographer or a  digital artist versus a painter every  artist was going to have a different  opinion on how art you were anyway and  so this is just a new variation in that  same version of judgment which I guess  exists very heavily in the art world I'm  coming to find out  but artists who were maybe looking to  see companies like stability get their  Just Desserts or something along those  lines are potentially watching the story  of Getty Images which the first AI art  lawsuit from what I'm gathering now this  is separate from the co-pilot lawsuit  that we've talked about that's a class  action with Microsoft and GitHub and  co-pilot so this is separate and this is  Getty Images against stability AI  because simply the Getty Images logo can  be reproduced Within  you know AI art  um the assumption is that Getty Images  were used to train which of course uh  again not illegal doesn't violate any  kind of law but Getty Images is going to  try to get money from stability AI  regardless it'll be interesting to see  how they're going to prove what kind of  Damages and all that other fun stuff so  it'll be something worth watching but I  doubt we're going to see anything useful  come of it or and I don't think we're  going to see new precedent actually set  from this specific instance and to  reiterate and for those who might be new  to the channel the way that latent  diffusion actually works is to  essentially give a model many examples  of what something could potentially be  and the model is never going to kick out  an exact duplicate especially if it's  been given multiple versions of  something and it's going to kind of give  it more of an average or you know the  medium of everything that it's been  shown so it's a really odd lawsuit I  understand the premise of people not  wanting to have their work taken from  them they want to get credit for the  things that they've done but again this  isn't really going anywhere because when  you look at how it actually functions  and how it works nothing is actually  being duplicated and to finish today off  I wanted to end on kind of a fun story  because the uh the world of AI the uh  the New Boston Dynamics video showing a  very limber robot these are always very  exciting to watch and to see how smooth  it almost looks CGI with how smooth  these things move around but this is uh  this is the future so we're going to  take a look at this  it's incredible watching these things  move around and it genuinely looks like  CGI like even the way that the Box moves  and Falls every single one of these  Boston Dynamics video I'm constantly  looking to see like okay is this fake  but  very impressive  all right guys that's all I got for you  today I appreciate you liking  subscribing commenting on the video all  of that good algorithm stuff if you have  any commentary on anything you saw today  or anything you want to add or any  questions about stuff you want to see  next time to make sure to drop me a line  and as always thanks for watching
