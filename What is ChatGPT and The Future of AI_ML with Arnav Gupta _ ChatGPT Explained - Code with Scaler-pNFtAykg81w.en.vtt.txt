 uh hey uh hi everybody uh welcome to  this live stream  uh see okay a lot of people already hate  the live stream I think 30 people okay  uh so so we'll discuss a lot of things  today uh chat GPT sort of title of the  video but but we'll discuss more about  other things in in uh AI advances as  well which can as uh you know a software  engineer was a you know a programmer how  that can possibly help you uh so that's  the idea just  here  um  so how many of you have tried out used  chart GPT and then uh you know  tried to you know generate some text or  anything from that GPT at how many of  you have done that  uh and then also what have you used it  for if you have already used it like  have you used it to uh just have for fun  have you tried to you know uh tried  coding related stuff uh with it before  uh have you tried it to create any uh I  don't know I have tried to create some  LinkedIn posts out of it as well  um  draft templates for email and official  messages have a poetry code photos  awesome  um so so just to give you a quick uh  example for uh what chat GPT can do for  the people who haven't seen and then we  will see uh what are sort of the uh  limitations also of it and after that uh  in today's video I would like to show  you something  stick which is uh GitHub co-pilot how  many of you use GitHub copilot uh these  days so it's a brilliant uh tool so you  can basically suggest you a lot of  things like it can suggest you uh code  it can suggest you SQL queries uh and  then very smartly based on the context  of your code so I'll also take a look at  how I have been used utilizing uh GitHub  co-pilot uh update and you know where  all in my workflow while writing code's  been helping me the other thing very  recently that has uh come out uh by uh  copilot called GitHub co-pilot Labs  which has a very uh nice set of features  which is you can use it to translate  code from one language to another  language uh it can explain code that uh  you know to you then it can also create  things like so actually there are custom  prompts that you can create so for  example uh  uh I do have that open so what you can  also do is uh take some piece of code  and actually there are things like  debug the code fix a bug inside a code  there are a lot of these things as well  and actually you might think that okay  that's that's really uh advanced stuff  like I mean uh can uh  basically Copilot uh do things that  there are a lot of languages where uh  typescript for example kotlin python  where data types from right hand side  are in from left front side of inferred  from the right hand side but you can  have a way to add data types and all so  we'll see how those brushes can work I  have also personally not used all of  them yet I've just been checking them  out uh so we'll see how those prompts  can work uh it's a very new world I can  say where you can mix and match  different AI prompts and create a lot of  new uh you know features and all  [Music]  um  so there's some extension it's suggested  to install yeah ignore that so let's  start with what all can chat GPT do and  then we will see okay  [Music]  um  so I think uh somebody has said uh chat  GPT replaces uh Google uh chat GPT I am  not sure if chat gbt replaces Google uh  that's a very I think uh something that  I've have been seeing on on Twitter and  all people talking about the chat GPT uh  has replaced Google  um but let's say uh you know if I some  of the from coding perspective I'm not  going into other things like okay I will  stick to technical topics let's let's  forget uh you know social political  topics over and just chat GPT from a  technical coding programming software  development perspective as well does it  you know replace uh Google search so so  if I ask uh something like you know uh  best  monitoring tool for mobile apps  something like this  2J GPT to just answer the question  whether chat GPT actually replaces  Google so first of all it takes a lot of  time  um  and then it does come up with uh  some answers I personally don't like  this uh like typing setup because  uh the AI is not really typing it's just  a animation there it makes it very slow  and all so if I search this thing and if  I search the same thing basically on  Google for example  um and then I get a little better things  in terms of uh some of the articles that  I get uh they have a lot of pros and  cons analysis done some of them are very  SEO driven I get it but they have a lot  of pros and cons analysis done why this  particular uh metric monitoring tool is  going to be good or not  um right versus the chat GPT one it  gives me sort of uh  four answers to this uh  you know most of them answers apart from  the name this part is actually just uh  keywords uh spread around right so you  know to take the argument that does chat  GPD solve for uh you know Google does it  make a better Google search  um I have been saying that you know the  kind of things I do search on Google uh  I don't necessarily get that obviously  like I mean uh who was the  13.  we saw something like a certain prime  minister of India might probably find an  answer there  um but then again in the same amount of  time if you go and search on actually  Google you will get the same answer  there as well  so  you'll get an answer here I think  it does give you the answer and it tells  a little bit about uh you know UPA and  one once again all of that as bad so  facts it will give an answer off uh but  if you ask about something that's  happening today uh you know  um I think you know who owns Twitter I'm  not sure if it might actually have the  correct answer because the model was  privately trained before the uh you know  Elon Musk took over Twitter for example  so that's a disadvantage because this  model has been trained on a particular  date and the model can't get updated  very fast on the fly so yeah it's a  public company in New York it does not  know that Elon Musk owns uh Twitter  right uh because the model was trained  before that so I think information  searching uh particularly uh I don't uh  you know  see in fact if it's before even  paragraph always made CEO so xcc or  Twitter is Jack Dorsey uh that's what it  says so uh that's that's sort of how it  uh works out with the you know um Google  thing but something good it can do is uh  if you just start a new chat again  um  from a coding perspective can it teach  you how to code uh  using CSS uh how can I make a text  and scrolling from  left to right okay so if I ask something  like this  now here I think it does actually  improve upon existing things like uh  let's say uh you know  Google also because if you ask that  exact same question I'll have to shift  through a bunch of stack Overflow  answers so if I have this using CSS can  I make text linking and scrolling from  left to right so I might find some CSS  tutorial right now I'm just going to the  first answer okay uh which might show  how to make it blinking so okay I found  out a blink then how to scroll I might  have to find it somewhere else as well  but mostly because Google picked up the  blinking part first most of the first  few answers are about blinking and then  there's some answer on scrolling how to  put them together uh but what does chat  gbt tell you that you know it will to  make a text Blakely you can use  animation property specify blink  um and uh then it also explains to you  to use any this animation you can apply  blinking class to an element to make a  text scroll left to right you can use  animation property scroll left and in  that same you know uh to make it  scrolling you can add the class calling  like this  and whether it actually works or not if  you want to just try it out we can check  it uh quickly  it answers are correct or not  um  so in HTML uh so in CSS I will do two  things that GPT told me I will add the  blinking thing and I will add the  scrolling thing  and I will add in HTML  scrolling and blinking  okay let's see if that works or not  right  uh there's a blinking animation does not  work uh let's see why  okay uh  should have worked actually  rather than using the visibility maybe  you can just check it with a different  color uh  anyway uh I was a scoring thing at least  did work  um so the thing is another Advantage I  feel with chat GPT is that it has  context uh while you are asking  something so for example if I  um write something like uh how to make a  get request in node yes  so this is something I ask if you give  me an answer on how to do it I can then  uh you know add on to it uh something  good somebody has pointed out that in  the last question I had asked that this  text Will scroll from left to right but  what GPT generated is the text that  Scrolls from right to left so these  mistakes do happen with GPD and I will  talk about why these mistakes happen uh  right and then these mistakes might seem  very silly mistakes in a sense but why  silly mistakes happen with GPT uh we  will discuss about that as well uh  internally how GPT Works based on that  we'll be able to understand also why I  said silly mistakes happen  um so so okay so to make a get request  node yes you can use a built-in HTTP  module uh and it says okay and then  replace username with actual username  something something may be using  github's API it shows okay and then it  also says that okay here's an example  during the access you know axios is a  library uh to to do this request okay  [Music]  um  so both requests to access the popular  libraries uh to send HTTP  um  uh can you tell me in your value using  been very interested if I just ask this  the thing is that this question that I  asked can I can you tell me using jQuery  instead I did not specify tell me what  exactly right tell me what nothing what  we'll do is because I have just talked  about a get request uh most likely you  will be able to understand this so let's  try so if I can tell I'm using jQuery  user instead uh I I I'm expecting it  should be able to tell me using  [Music]  I'll do the same thing  so another thing that I like about how  chart GPT answers is it is very human uh  Humane in nature like certainly to make  a get request it does not just start off  with the response it tries to talk to  you that's part of the way the model  behaves the model has been made  conversational in nature so unless  you ask it to do something uh specific  like not be conversation it will try to  be conversational in nature  okay  um it does I mean I feel uh it's uh very  good at teaching basics of uh certain  things  um the downside obviously is that just  in case if there was something wrong in  what it taught me right uh if I say it  here and think that GPT actually knows  everything and then I just take what it  is teaching uh as the truth and go on  problem is there is no no checks and  balances around what text it generates  is correct or not there is no unit test  written around what GPT generates nobody  is monitoring what it generates as well  it's just you sitting and generating and  if like a bunch of people to different  place in the world generating GPT  answers in different places nobody's  really monitoring if the cards is coming  out or correct or not and there is a  fair bit of scope of doing mistakes and  the kind of mistake that GPD does are  also usually very minor small mistakes  but can change the entire meaning for  example the left to right uh issue for  example so it does not make a mistake in  getting the text to scroll so instead of  scrolling uh making it I don't know uh  go big and small in size which is like  absolutely different logic it won't make  that kind of a mistake but will make a  much more severe mistake that when I  asked you to go from left to right it  does right to left that's because uh a  lot of uh how these AI models actually  generate uh text or generate any uh sort  of responses are a lot like pattern  matching where it has been trained on a  lot of data where it has seen CSS code  for scrolling and it has seen 50  examples or 100 examples of it and based  on that when you ask it to write its  calling on CSS it tries to generate text  which is similar to that  um it does have there are two models uh  of uh GPT by the way there is a codex  model and there is a DaVinci model The  DaVinci model generates text and the  Codex model generates code on chat GPT  both the models are available so it can  actually show you code and then explain  it to you uh and then GitHub copilot  uses only the Codex model we will go and  talk about it also  um one of the things that GPT is  definitely good at is that if there is a  particular type of problem that has been  solved a lot of times already right  which GPT actually solves better because  there has been more data for it to train  on so for example if there are lead code  questions that a lot of people have  solved uh before right  um and that if it tries to solve it it  will actually be able to solve it a  little much more easier just to give you  an example I'll go to uh you know GitHub  co-pilot and show that as well  um one more thing that I think is also  good is that it you can actually give it  code and it will explain it to you as  well so if I just for example take this  coded GPT itself uh has in it or maybe  you know uh let's say uh  an alternative to access maybe okay  fetch apis there okay so fetch API  examples JS so maybe so  um okay this is a fetch example so I  will take this I will tell uh  or this code does and I ask  okay I don't know what happened  uh okay I think maybe it's not because  JavaScript is trying to get executed uh  so  I think we'll start a new thread and see  so let's see  Sometimes some server issues like this  happen  um but but we can I think  those are more not AI bugs but basic  software engineering bugs I think they  had just released it a few days back and  it has uh you know immediately gotten uh  I think more than one million users  within the first five days  um  one of the things you can do is like you  took it and it asked me asked I asked it  to explain and it gave me a very  detailed explanations uh you can re-ask  GPT to explain it more concisely rather  than uh you know uh to to sort of expand  on status codes and all of that  so now it's it's much more concise  explanation you can you can do those  kind of things you can optimize that as  well which means it's good to generate  actually documentation uh for source  code as well that's also something that  uh GPT can definitely do  um one of the things I have been uh just  trying out GPT for is also that you know  um  so if I write something like  right uh 2000  character  LinkedIn post  explaining  distributed okay  so a more theoretical topic for example  distributed caching is a high level  design topic if I ask to generate a  LinkedIn post explaining distributed  caching for example  okay  so it does generate the sort of LinkedIn  post uh you know uh that you might uh  find on  LinkedIn sometimes people just you know  trying to Garner engagement by writing  posts like this and I have been trying  that so there have been people who have  engaged with those posts as well so  um if if I just show you uh some of my  LinkedIn posts that I recently wrote  those are generated by uh GPT so for  example I think  [Music]  so this is something I did using GPT  which is generating uh  project ideas uh for people similarly uh  this was a post where I generated like a  post on how uuid works okay  the thing is uh that if I do know what  uuid is and I ask GPU to generate I can  check whether the explanation is correct  or not before posting it  um some people had guessed that whether  it was generated with GPT and I said  that yeah this is generated with GPT but  these are good like I mean if you just  want to write random posts on LinkedIn  and grow a following and all of that  stuff uh this is actually uh makes it  easy to do that it increases the amount  of spam on LinkedIn that uh day by day  is anyway already increasing uh but that  aside if somebody really wants to  generate limit post it can do that I  think I did one for load balancing as  well  um again I think there were people who  actually engaged with that uh like I did  answers strategy PD yes but there were  people who actually answered uh the the  debated stuff and they were actually  basically debating versus chat GPT not  versus B because this text is not even  generated by me  um the thing is uh that if I now go back  to the answer that GPT has generated  here  um a 2000 characters in post explaining  distributed caching  um  this uh  answered  um is not actually about distributed  caching but just about basic caching so  it says the dispocational technique uh  used computer to improve performance and  scalability application by storing  frequently accessed data in a cache this  allows the application to retrieve the  data from the cache and slow out more  resource intelligence so this answer  even if it was not distribute cache if I  just asked explain HTTP caching this  answer would have still been the same  right the distributed part uh you know  it does not particularly  expand on that much so I might not use  this answer a lot but then I know what  distributed caching is but if I just go  and ask you know  [Music]  foreign  between distributed caching and normal  caching I can get some more data points  on that right again that also to be able  to validate whether GPT gave the correct  answer or not I should be someone who  knows the answer already  um but if you are somebody who does not  know this answer and if you're thinking  that I can ask GPT and learn from it uh  you might end up with wrong answers you  might end up with partially correct  answers you might end up with answers  which uh don't go beyond the surface  like there are a lot of people  influencers on Instagram talking about  tech topics and they really don't go  deep but they're just talking on the  surface about okay these are some  keywords uh GPT can generate a lot of  text like that which is at the surface  level but not going deep  so here I think the answer gets a little  bit more uh significant uh because it's  better because it's now actually talking  about uh you know what's the difference  between normal caching and distribute  caching so actually double down on that  so so the thing is that this answer the  first one that I got if I'm somebody who  uh already knows caching then this  answer is not a good answer for me  because I know caching and disaster does  not tell me a lot about what distributed  caching is additionally on top of normal  caching but if I don't know caching uh  at all then this answer is even worse  because I feel that this answer is about  distributed caching uh  while I mean I don't really know the  difference between normal caching and  distribute caching and I think take this  answer I think that this is what  distributed caching is it does not  really go deep on the other hand this  answer actually goes a little more  deeper into uh why distribute caching is  different from just caching on a single  server okay  so anybody else has any suggestions that  that golden credit sessions if you think  that we can ask some GPT about  um one of the things that I do uh find  interesting is uh I teach  um you know people one of the things  that I do uh find interesting is  sorry there's a bit of Eco there so  um when I teach people to build projects  in my classes and all after teaching  people to build one or two projects I  asked them that okay you go ahead and  build a few more projects on your own uh  make uh you know uh 10 15 projects and  two three of them would be good so over  the next one year spend working on  projects and people listen to that and  then they say that how can I come up  with 10 15 project ideas I can't even  come up with two project ideas I'm not I  can't think of what project I can build  right  um that is something where GPT can  actually help you so if I say that  uh you know  uh  suggest some  second API project ideas for someone who  has recently  learned to use uh Java  input  the project should take  one or two weeks to complete and should  it was  Concepts like  databases uh rest apis  Authentication  um so if this is the prompt it's a  fairly complex prompt though so imagine  who can answer these questions somebody  who knows bring boot well has built  projects themselves also uh such a  person can answer this question right  this is the kind of question that I  think a lot of you people sometimes when  I'm doing live streams you do ask me  right you ask that okay here what kind  of projects I can make I have learned  back in development so and so right this  is not somebody who does not know  development somebody who does not know  um API database authentication has not  built their own projects they can't  answer this question which means this is  an expertise question this is not a  question that a Layman can answer if  somebody is experienced an expert they  can answer this question and this is  something where I think GPD shines a lot  where you can ask this question and you  get good answers out of it and you can  actually pick any one of these  um you know project ideas and actually  start working on that so it gives me  task management app recipe database  budget tracking API real estate listing  API weather API and it tells you know  things in details okay  [Music]  a weather API you mentioned uh Point  number five uh  give me detailed  [Music]  project  requirements and specs for building it  uh  what  features  what features it should have uh  which API and points to build  what  is  should we create in the  I'm getting a little deeper now at this  point I'm saying that okay I want to  pick up project number five can you give  me detailed requirements for it which  API it wants to build uh okay and what  entities uh in the schema should I build  uh so I like the answer maybe number  five I want to pick and actually build  it  um so it's giving me some detail uh okay  so now it's saying features the API  should allow for so and so things so  this now starts looking like uh the  questions that people actually get and  take home interviews uh so if you apply  for startups and all right uh those kind  of companies generally give you a  take-home uh project like this so I see  that there are two advantages like if  I'm actually hiring people I can use GPT  to generate assignments and then if I am  you know uh you know learning let's say  a particular Tech stack I can use GPT to  suggest me some ideas and then actually  give me very specific requirements so I  can actually build the Project based on  this  it still means I mean you have to go and  build the application yourself uh right  but  but the idea and the requirements  somebody has given okay so I mean it  also means that you know you have turned  chat GPT into your product manager uh  and they are creating these requirements  that you have to build on but it's good  I think I mean uh this endpoint should  accept query parameters for location and  uh you know units of management if I  take just this part of the text from  here  and you show me some sample code for  this  um this I am not expecting GPU to  actually be able to give a good answer  to it but let's see how far uh GPT can  be pushed  foreign  the questions become more specific you  will also notice that the model takes  more time to respond  um okay and these kind of things can  happen the request timed out uh okay so  it's most likely it will time out  because it's a very specific question  and the model might not be able to  generate something for this uh very  easily  you can maybe make this a little more  specific uh  okay it's giving some answers  so it's making a rest controller in Java  which is fairly good actually I would  say it is calling a Weather Service and  it would actually call that so this is  actually creating your boilerplate code  for this controller as well  right so your boilerplate controller  code is actually made out of this  um it's a good place to start from right  and giving these explanations which I  think are not required I did not ask it  but it's giving these explanations I  mean that's fine  um  but it's a good companion at least a  learning level that I can see that okay  nice learning companion not bad I would  say okay  um  so by the way uh you can actually use  this as an API in your own project as  well so there is the open AI API where  text completion image generation uh you  know and code completion kind of uh apis  are there so these are actually apis so  you can actually link to this API uh  from from somewhere and you can actually  use this there is API docs also  available for the documentation uh how  to use you know  basically uh how to use the API this is  uh open the open API project download  there is a they have I think sdks in  node.js and flask so you can download  that and use that there is the  playground so this is where you can try  these things out in more detail this is  the same back end actually uh what this  uses and what chat GPT uses very similar  packets uh here you can  give more contact complex prompts as  well and you can select which model to  be used  the Codex models are text based the GPT  models are sorry the codus models are  code base the GPT models are text based  the bigger dots means those models are  more complex as in bigger models which  means they have lot more data set  trained but those models are costlier to  be used as well you can select certain  things like what's the length of the  prompt you can select like some  frequencies and all all of these things  you can hover over them and tells them  what exactly it means in terms of what  is getting  uh generated there okay  if you have text  s have evolved very recently like Tech  Stacks or programming languages which  had changed uh since 2020 a lot you  won't get very good answers because this  models uh has a cut off in 2021 for  example which means that uh things which  have recently happened uh let's say  react latest version released a few  months back if you want some example out  of that you might not get that okay uh  now coming to actually GitHub co-pilot  which is uh something that actually does  change the game when you're working with  code and this is something that I have  been using a lot  um so on on GitHub co-pilot uh you know  uh and I'll show you some of the few  things that it can do  and then there is GitHub copilot prompts  what it can do so there are two things I  think uh you know uh and I'll show you  in two examples one is like if I do lead  code right  um so if I just  open uh  okay  another belief called uh answered and  I'm not very good at lead code I will  pick up something very easy uh I'm not a  good competitive programmer by the way  just just uh you know I don't want to  embarrass myself on the live stream so  I'll pick up some easy question  um so let's pick up some some random  easy question uh what is the plus one  question  um  let's say Roman 20j right so this is a  question we have to uh I think input uh  is this take an input and convert right  now this is something that a lot of  people would have done already right  um  everyone to uh integer conversion so I'm  using GitHub copilot here I have get a  copilot installed as a plugin here and  I'm using GitHub copilot so if I uh  start doing this uh project  in what language I can pick up let's say  typescript  foreign  so it says okay if  this is uh split and accumulator and  current so it splits it into this create  that is something like this okay uh if I  just I mean do this uh okay  but it will be zero  um  foreign  this is not actually correct though I  don't think it handles the case where  there has been a number before it like  IX IB those kind of cases are not  handled by this uh but it gets me to  like a fairly close by uh what I feel is  that with questions like Roman twin  teaser which is fairly common a lot of  people have solved it uh what will  happen uh you know is uh  that  if you actually know the answer if you  have thought of the answer you can  generate a lot of the boilerplate by  copilot it might not give you the  exactly correct answer here okay  um  [Music]  so if I I mean just submit this uh  answer here okay so what will happen in  lead code is uh  just a second  so if I test it on uh  default test cases  there's some problem in my lead code  extension apparently  um  so that's something that happens with I  mean I'm just trying to show that what  happens with questions which are very  commonly solved uh right  um particularly this now if I uh try to  take a look at uh something that I was  doing recently which is advent of code  which is uh every year this thing  happened which is advent of code is a  foreign  questions that happen every December  there is this guy Eric wastel who does  this right  um so  for this kind of question what happens  is every question is fairly unique here  now I think the first question there was  um  something around there are some Santa's  reindeers are delivering something and  you have these numbers what I have seen  with these questions is that a GitHub  copilot does not actually work very well  because the format of the question is  fairly uh you know uh the question it  has not been trained on this particular  model because this question actually was  released in uh you know like December of  2022 and the model has never been  trained on any Solution on this  particular question but within that  question uh if I take a look at uh some  part of the code for example I was just  writing this code and uh the part that  got generated to me very easily was I  think  yeah so if I'm writing something uh like  split a line into two parts at midpoint  uh it generated these two lines for me  automatically if I say that you know  group lines into uh groups of three it  generated this for Loop for me uh very  easily uh I can I can do this uh  you know just one more time as well so  if I do four and then  I wait for the answers  these uh you know uh things that are  generated they are fairly fast now let's  say the next thing I need to do here is  that find elements that are present in  all three parts you can actually write a  comment  uh find elements that are  present in all three lines  so it actually does this so what I have  to do is I have to split uh  the first string into like characters  and then for every character I need to  find out characters that are included in  the second and the third or not okay  and it gives me priority and then stuff  like that and varieties and plus variety  okay so this is generates well because  I'm not talking about like particularly  if I look at my question number three  what it was about was some people  packing bags and all of these things I  did not talk to get a co-pilot about  these things I read the question I  understood it and I understood that what  I have to do is I have to split the  string into two halves and I have to  find characters which are in those two  parts and for the second part I have to  do is I had to take three strings at a  time and I have to find out characters  which are common in all three so now if  I understand what I have to do like  translate the you know complex story in  the question down to actual logic I do  myself then I can you know rely on  copilot to actually generate the code  for me which I feel is is good like uh  you know for example if I was actually  taking interview of somebody and if they  use GPT for actually generating these  lines of code while they have already  figured out how to solve the answer I  think that's good because there's this  famous saying which says right uh a  mathematician knows how to solve the  problem not uh he does not sit down and  actually solve it so this is fine like  if you have figured out the logic in  your head and then you basically prompt  uh GitHub copilot into generating the  lines for you  this I think is a good superpower to  have as a software engineer it makes you  more productive it makes you very fast  like since I've been using GitHub pilot  what I've been seeing is that I have  been getting faster and faster in in uh  code that I write so this is something  good I believe  um  and it was generated this way right  so that's there the next thing which I  was more interested in was uh for  example if this piece of the code and  that's where I was talking about the  brushes so here if I talk about uh  GitHub brushes language translation and  explain so if I take this piece of line  code  here and I asked it to explain  [Music]  it actually gives you a good explanation  I would say uh we iterate over lines in  steps of three so that uses the same  logic the first line is same as before  the second line is same F4 this is is  wrong these three these Point number two  and three are not so useful this and  this these are not so useful uh I'll so  I'll just generate that again sorry  uh  um we are using Speedmaster convert  second RF characters using the filter  node to find the elements that are in  all three lines uh we are using index of  method to find the priority it's a good  explanation I would say uh so if  somebody looks at this code for the  first time and does not understand what  it is they can ask that and code does  the following as copies is another way  to solve it as well so this is more line  by line  um it gives an explanation  um even more beautifully than that is  what I feel is the brush part which is  uh  the  brushes where I mean if I take this set  of lines right and I say Okay add types  it adds that this is of type string this  is our type string it added these data  types which was not there like just  before that these data types were not  present if I'm using a language like  typescript or python where I can add  types if I want to optionally it can  generate types for me those are I think  very supremely useful features and I  think these will become part of the  standard uh toolkit and if GitHub Co  pilot is a paid service I think most uh  professional software Engineers who are  writing code for a living they would  start to pay for GitHub for pilot and  they'll be using this because it's a  very important feature I feel  um I think you can do a bunch of other  things as well like you know uh if I ask  it to  um sort of uh document this code  um  it will turn it into a function and then  document it basically  so all of that is something that it can  do  um if I want to make it more readable so  it tried something uh what it did is I  think I don't know  hi  made it first line Second Line third  line stuff like that so if the variables  were something like x y z here right  um  foreign  programming kind of code where people  just write XYZ variables let's see if it  can make that more readable or not if I  click on readable  uh uh it did not it will need more  context actually so if I give the entire  code LLC I think  foreign  [Music]  so it does work sometimes it does not  really work that well sometimes but I  think it's improving uh slowly slowly  um  and then finally another thing that I  was doing recently is that these  questions from Advent of code that I was  solving I was trying to solve them in  multiple languages to learn uh rust and  go myself so I am very good at  typescript and kotlin but I don't know  uh rust and go so what is doing is  solving the question first in typescript  or in kotlin which is on my first  language in that sense and then I am uh  you know trying to write it in go and  press to learn that language so here  there is another thing which I found out  is that if I sort of  do is create a new  um  kotlin file for example and if I ask  it to take this typescript code and  convert it into a different language so  if I take all of this code ask it to  convert it into kotlin  okay  how close would that be so I'll just  copy this code  here I had to make a few changes  so to run the kotlin code  I need to include the comments  and usually like I don't need these  arguments actually here and I'll read  lines  yeah  I do this the rest of the code uh you  know  um is it actually usable code or not um  so if I take the typescript code I just  run it  um this is the answer seven seven six  six two four one five I have not even  looking at the rest of the code I'm just  trying to see if it can run it or not  uh I think it did not print because it  has not called the main function I'll  just  call that  foreign  [Music]  if you don't know that language then you  will actually have to go and debug that  um so the problem that would have  [Music]  uh have had is I think here  index out of bound would have happened  somewhere but if I just compare it for a  second  um  it's it's actually a fairly good uh  capability I feel because there aren't a  lot of online services for example where  you can paste typescript code get kotlin  code in return  um so you know it does some lines dot  for each and for every line it's doing  line dot slice is doing the second line  which is taking from uh here till there  um right I think this until uh setup is  not exactly correct uh line dot slice  does not take this as an argument it  will have to take a comma there so there  are silly mistakes again like I said  this until here is correct for in zero  until lines dot side this is correct so  until is used in kotlin to do for Loops  it's not used in slice so that has to be  fixed  um right  um  I think the rest of the code is is  looking pretty good I would say I mean  uh it does uh things like take the first  second third is correctly it does the  intersection is uh takes all the items  and then sees if it contains uh in the  second and third  um so in that sense I think if it's  uh not bad to actually translate bunch  of code from one language another  language which is something that people  might need if uh you are converting a  project let's say which was originally a  node.js project to a kotlin or a Java  project in Future these kind of things  can be fairly useful uh in my opinion  so  um I think that's one of the state of  how things are getting used today I've  been using uh GitHub copilot as well as  chat GPT a lot  [Music]  um  the the question does uh you know uh beg  to be asked that how much of tools like  gpt3 chat GPT githubilant replace uh the  jobs of human beings  um I think it's a tricky question uh I  would say somebody can look at what  these things are doing and think that oh  uh whatever I am doing these tools are  able to do that exactly same thing  if you are feeling like that I think uh  you need to learn and grow a lot because  uh these tools are not able to do very  complex things and they do make a lot of  mistakes as at least as of today so if  what they do today if you feel like this  is something that threatens your job  already then you do need to do some  upskilling because probably you are  doing very machine like work you are  probably not doing stuff that actually  requires original thought  um because if I tell somebody to build a  software make an app it's not like  copilot can generate the entire app for  them but obviously there will be places  where they have let's say thought out  and I'm thinking it out loud like let's  say I'm making an Android app and inside  that I have to create a  you know video player inside it if I  write a comment uh you know uh generate  a video player and uh fetch the video  from uh URL and play it and if GPT can  generate I mean a GitHub Pro pilot in  this sense can generate at least a basic  skeleton of that code and then I will  make the fixes like maybe change the url  correctly maybe buffer it or stuff like  that that's actually a superpower uh but  that does not mean that if a manager who  does not know how to code comes and  tells GitHub copilot that create a video  player app for me it won't be able to  automatically make it but then me who as  a software developer is making the video  player app myself for me it's useful  because it can come in and do those  things which are boilerplate work or you  know more tedious work and all of that  so what do you think uh any any thoughts  any questions people have I uh we'll  just uh you know stop speaking here just  stop the demo of the things that I was  showing and I'd love to pick up some  questions any questions that you have  about these AI tools uh what things that  you might want to use these for in the  future uh who would open the floor to  the questions for everybody  if you have questions which are not  particularly GPT related but some other  questions as well happy to uh answer  them as well  uh Sameer uh you asked like how did you  get a collection of lead code question  set so actually there's a lead code  extension  um on on vs code uh  I'm using this extension there's this  early code problem extension it's a very  popular one uh with that you can do  um lead code actually from your browser  itself you just open see the list of  questions and start solving them right  from here  well this would I think  [Music]  foreign  was actually correct I believe  I think priorities sums uh  foreign  's not disclosing the source of their  data can lead to policy violations and  copyright issues so I think that's one  of the questions which are more about uh  law catching up to technology so the  technology was there and it got built  and I think the data that it trained on  uh the data was publicly available so it  got trained now after training that  people are making these AI models and if  as long as they're free that's fine but  as long as you start charging money for  this  right which is where  people have to see that how do we  interpret the law of  copyrights and all right now the current  law has fairly gray areas because it's  not like I'm copying the art directly  right  um but but nevertheless uh let me show  you something  um  in  um  okay open air itself like if I go to the  image generation one right  uh sorry it'll have to be  so if I open Dali and here if I do  something like  uh upload an image to start with right  so let's say I upload my image  it can straight up generate a bunch of  variations for my image I can do things  like uh let's say uh  it generates a bunch of variations of  this image right uh some of them  obviously don't look like real human  faces but for example this one is can  definitely be a real human face for  example  um the other thing is uh for example if  I take and try to edit it right  and this is sort of my  uh I think oh sorry  so if I give it a prompt uh  that if I say this is my generation  frame  and let me say I give a prompt  oh sorry I think I have to  um  we draw this image in  Mango's  uh self  portrait Style  so  now the thing is that if I take one of  these images and if I actually see  uh back till Vanguard self portrait  right  um so is this copyright this is not  copyright becomes a little bit gray area  because obviously it has learned from  that and it's generating things which  are very similar to that uh right so  if I take this image again  I say that okay  let me draw this in monolitha style  uh do we have things like charged I  think uh uh so but to the answer the  question both are uh free actually uh  so you can do a bunch of funny stuff of  course uh the thing is like when it  generates things like this and then if I  frame it and I probably sell this image  and if I make money then whether it's  copyright or not I think laws of  different countries will catch up to  this they will  create a mechanism which has already  existed always like on YouTube if you  use background audio from some singer  then you can't make money from that  video if I do something like this maybe  it will say that this if I make money  out of this some loyalty loyalty might  need to go to monalisa trust in Paris in  luday or something like that right those  things can happen but it's very cloudy  uh so far about the free version uh I  think crazy Studios you've asked so  right now all the tools I showed chat  gbd gpt3 daily GitHub copilot they're  all free to be used actually  they're not going to be free permanently  they are they are very at Alpha Beta  stages so that's why they're free but  they won't be free forever  um  to answer your question about being an  Android developer with eight plus years  of experience and whether DSA is  important to join or not it depends  company to company for example you want  to apply to Google DStv for sure if you  apply to Facebook or I mean Twitter has  changed a lot but I knew for sure that  you know before this year on Mustang  when Twitter used to hire Android  Engineers they would not ask DSA  Facebook also does hire mobile  developers without DSA questions uh  there are many companies who do  um  so my target where I used to work at uh  they they asked system design mv's MVB  mmvei kind of things clean code  architecture ask you to build an Android  app take home project but they won't ask  you DSA questions for a senior Android  engineer roles so it depends when  comparative company that's the situation  uh so it depends  [Music]  uh cool I think uh if there are no other  questions uh from anybody uh uh we will  wrap up the live stream then  um thanks everybody for tuning in to  this  um and and you know feel free to uh you  know  connect with me on on Twitter  Etc and share your thoughts on what all  you are using uh AI based tools for what  do you think that direction is going  towards uh if you find out some very new  use case I think people have done AI  based uh uh I think image generation  there's a lens app those kind of things  I think there's also a lot of scope for  people today to build uh products which  use these AI tools and become the first  player in the market and gain a lot of  uh you know attraction so there's been I  think uh this uh Avatar AI uh  kind of thing where uh I think  you upload a photo and it generates a  lot of AI uh images and all and you have  to uh it will take 30 minutes or so to  generate all of these and you can you  have to pay money to do that so they are  making a lot of money right now tomorrow  some large company like Google will  start doing this and you won't have an  advantage but uh today probably you can  do that so that's something that you can  probably look at and build  um  foreign  thanks everybody uh have a good day uh  and uh bye bye we'll see you soon in
