 prescription without diagnosis is  malpractice  we all this is so infuriating and also  really funny to watch here's my advice  since you asked wait  wait  I'm not telling you first what's  happened is amazing it's also old by the  way  I'm so excited to announce this I am now  officially a certified AI expert and to  prove that you can see my certification  here written in Old ink y'all this is so  infuriating and also really funny to  watch every donkey with the internet  connection is a freaking AI thought  leader and the number of courses that  I'm being offered and you know it's like  you've had this thing for three weeks  now and you're the expert you're the  authority that's great good for you well  done here's my advice since you asked  what's happened is amazing it's also old  by the way gpt3 is two years old the  only reason we're all happy about it now  is because they made an interface that  actually lets dummies like me play with  it and if you haven't played with chat  GPT by the way you have to go do that  right now today it's unbelievable and  I'm not saying that it's not that's not  what this video is about I think  honestly the the AI driven  graphic creation is even more impressive  like I get lost in mid-journey it blows  my mind what mid journey is capable of  but  all that said this this Gold Rush  towards AI prescription without  diagnosis is malpractice and so you  don't even necessarily know where it  lands yet and if you do you don't need  to watch this video you might say no  like no dude I'm actually using chat gbt  in order to do these 15 things the other  day my CTO used chat GPT to identify  YouTube channels that we could use for a  specific type of targeting great you  have a use case awesome run with it if  you don't know where it fits yet  don't worry wait wait it out Pioneers  get killed settlers prosper  so you know Google wasn't the first  search engine Facebook wasn't the first  social media profile Apple didn't create  the first anything the first smartphone  the first tablet the first you know  Smart Watch like they just wait in the  wings you let somebody else pay all the  r d costs make all the mistakes take all  the arrows socially deal with all the  legislation build the market build the  awareness and by that time they're so  heavily bloated they die and then you  can step in for a fraction of the cost  and and you know a fraction the amount  of time and then take over and this is  true for big markets and small markets  you don't need to be first period full  stop now pay attention you can pay  attention to what your competitors are  doing what people in other Industries  are doing that you can carry over to  your industry that's all perfectly fine  so I'm not telling you not to learn  about AI I'm not saying that at all I  think that it's a very worthy Endeavor  it might be one of the most important  things that we can learn at this point  this is not a glitch I'm interrupting  the video you're

Below in the comments and now back to  your regularly scheduled program  but this this frantic like oh God like  we have to you know get out ahead of it  you don't have to skate to where the  puck is going because nobody knows where  the puck is going including maybe most  of all these idiots selling this  horseshit content that I don't know and  I mean some of some of what I'm seeing  is actually pretty cool I tweeted  something the other day uh this gal  posted like a collection of very  practical actionable things that AI can  do for you right now today but some of  it is such garbage it's just digital  Naval gazing they're just pontificating  on their philosophical undertake like  you don't know you don't know you have  no idea I don't know nobody knows so  stop that and don't buy anybody's AI  course the the caveat I'll provide is if  you're in Industry if you're in an  industry where you can see AI now doing  what you do  I'm in that industry that's what  performance Max is you know if you're if  you're a content creator if you're a  graphic designer I'm I don't I don't  think that your job is like on the  chalking chopping block right now today  but I think that the the shift to the  way you do what you do is going to be  pretty substantial it's worth paying  attention but I still don't think you  need to run around buying a bunch of AI  courses because none of these fools know  they don't know just go play with play  with the products they're all free or  really cheap and they've been around  like I don't understand why all of a  sudden everybody's you know toenails got  lit on fire we've had this we've had it  accessible it's going to start getting  really cool gbt3 is 170 billion  parameters  gbt4 is 175 trillion parameters like if  you think if you think Chad gbt is cool  now yeah gpt4 is significantly larger  and more powerful than gp3 170 trillion  parameters compared to gpt3s 175 billion  parameters so it's 100 times more  powerful so this thing is going to get  really cool I think it's worth paying  attention to I I do think it's going to  have significant impacts in ways we  don't even understand that's not the  first time that's ever happened nobody  could see where the internet was going  to go when we had the internet I  remember you know in the very beginning  it was all just chat rooms and we're  like okay so we can mail faster and now  you know look at it that's why I think  it's okay to wait you don't have to get  out ahead of the curb or be the smartest  person in the room when it comes to all  this stuff as a matter of fact that  actually may hurt you and uh yeah that's  all I got that's my soapbox I hope this  is helpful I'll see y'all tomorrow  really amazing article came out from  search engine Journal an hour ago  um shout out to Muhammad Abbas on our  team for finding this and shout out to  Brian Frederick over at scj published uh  one hour ago clickbots and fake traffic  cost online advertisers
