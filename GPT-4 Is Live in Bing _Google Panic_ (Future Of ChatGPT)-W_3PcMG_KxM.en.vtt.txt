 Google is losing AI War right now and it  can possibly get replaced by Bing and in  this video I want to explain you guys  what is happening and also how this can  affect us as users so there is a big  thing happening right now for 13 years  Google was number one search engine but  right now it can possibly get wiped out  because of chat GPT and I also want to  explain why why it can possibly get  replaced by Bing because Microsoft has  invested huge amounts of money into  check GPT and they also integrated chat  GPT or gpt4 into Bing and I want to  explain you guys also how you can use  Bing and this chatbot Google is really  in panic they have invested huge amounts  of money around 300 million dollars into  Bard AI but it is nowhere close to chat  BT and I can possibly call it trash  because it is not very good right now we  are going to see what is going to happen  we are in the middle of AI Wars with  Google and Microsoft so this is going to  be really interesting to see what is  going to happen we are going to get  introduced to new technology really fast  and this is going to be fun for us all I  just want to show you guys how big chat  GPT is because not a lot of people can't  compare this so you can see in five days  chat GPT reached 1 million users from  launch you can also see that Instagram  needed around 75 days to reach 1 million  users and Spotify needed  150 days to reach 1 million users on  their platform so you can see how crazy  and explosively chat the GPT grew to 1  million users just in five days from  launch and I also want to show you guys  why Google can get replaced to Bing  because of chat GPT so 60 of Revenue  that Google earns comes from search  engines so basically when someone search  on Google Google is making money from  them and I want to show you guys how  Google is making money from search  engine and how this is going to affect  Google badly so for example when someone  searched how to lose weight you're going  to see these ads are going to pop up so  how Google is earning money they show  these ads and when you click on this ad  you're going to get sent to the website  that Advertiser pay for example 10 cents  per click and advertisers pay money to  get customers or new viewers on their  website and that is how Google is  basically making 60 percent of Revenue  and and I want to show you guys why is  this really important because for  example if you need information how to  lose weight you need to go on tons of  different websites you need to do your  own research and also sometimes it is  not going to get correct information  you're not going to get correct  information from these websites so what  can you do with this you can go on chat  GPT and basically say how to lose weight  fast  give me  free meal plan  and you can see that chat GPT is going  to provide you with all information that  you need so you don't need to go on  Google do your own research go on  different websites read different blog  posts and tons of different stuff you  can just go on chat GPT get strange  instructions straight answered questions  and you can basically add whatever you  want you can see I have said that I need  a free free meal plan so their chat upt  gave me free meal plan so why is this  really big for us as users we don't need  to waste our time and this is really  great way to get right information you  can also see that Microsoft unveils new  Bing with chat GPT Powers so I want to  show you guys why Microsoft is very very  smart because they invested around 10  billion dollars into chat GPT and they  have now GP D4 on their on their  research engine so for example I want to  show you guys how this looks like so you  can see I have opened a bing and before  you start using this uh search engine I  want to show you guys what you need to  do because first of all you need to see  a new browser that looks like this if  you don't see the browser that looks  like this what you need to do is you  need to click right here I'm showing you  guys because I didn't see browser that  look like this for at first so you want  to click on right here on these three  dots click on settings and what I did I  changed changed the country so you want  to go and change the country right here  and also what I did is I have clicked  again on these three dots right here  clicked on labs and changed from Auto or  default to more frequently so you want  to click on more frequent and now you're  ready to use Bing search engine so what  I did first I have a search for  something random like how to play chess  let's say  and you can see that gpt4 is not showing  up so I want to show you guys what I did  next I have seen this button right here  that says chat and that is basically  gpt4 so when you click on this button  right here right now it is not available  and you can go and test gbt4 on Bing but  I want to show you guys just an example  because they give you guys some prompts  that you can use and see how Bing is  going to look like and for example just  to test it out let's click on this first  one so I'm going to click on try it on  Bing and what is going to happen is a  Bing is going to show us just an example  of gpt4 on their search engine so  basically this is chat GPT typing your  answer and you can click on search more  and say thank you for this sounds  delicious or you can chat with chat GPT  but you can also see this is integrated  in search engine because this is  something very futuristic this is going  to look crazy when they release the  final version and it is going to be very  interesting to see where this is going  to take us because you you can see I  need to throw dinner party for six  people who are vegetarians and tons of  different stuff and you can see a chat  GPT is providing us with right  information right websites everything  that is ready for us we don't need to do  any research we don't need to do any uh  let's call it different website search  you can see what our chat GPT has done  for us  you can also go and search for different  stuff right now you can search for write  a writing poem let's click on try that  so  why chat GPT is not showing up right  here this is probably some bug right now  but uh chatgpt should show up on right  right here as you can see right here I  don't know why it doesn't show up for a  rhyming I'm going to click it again just  to see if this is some problem with  being so this is probably an error for  this prompt and you can basically search  different stuff on Bing and what are you  going to get is help from chat GPT on  the right corner that is using gpt4 and  this is really crazy because as I said  you can get help while you're searching  on Bing but Google right now doesn't  have that so I'm highly interested in  where this is going to take us because  Google is not going to sit around  they're probably going to invent invent  some crazy different stuff and different  AIS you can see right now they have  Google have announced that they're going  to create Bard AI I think they invested  around the 300 million dollars into this  project that is created by open AI to  rival a chat GPT but uh right now  nothing can compare with chat GPT and it  is going to as I said it is going to be  very interesting to see where this is  going to take us so if you're interested  in more
