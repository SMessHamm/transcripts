 this video is brought to you by bharti  cement  [Music]  welcome to another episode of ramuism  is  the latest rage sensation is  foreign  [Music]  foreign  also  okay data management  foreign  as a beginning  in the next two three years will be  flooded with the options options yeah  as a person you know exactly uniqueness  foreign  [Music]  second look  foreign  objectives  foreign  foreign  foreign  so from a place of feeling assuming yeah  guessing charge GPT is normalizing  everything to data logic yes yes  absolutely  mistakes  of course yesterday the mistakes  continuously becomes smarter as more new  data comes to it you know money should  expose it supposedly they become  foreign  foreign  foreign  foreign  foreign  [Music]  you will still believe the machine  foreign  of the world will become automated right  apparently make malls running  defense lawyers prepared they say  drafted childhood right  Netflix  analysis is based on data data and it is  sifting through multiple things  it is  analyzing the entire thing and giving  you a solution right  you know people for example  you know  even worse  [Music]  soldiers  he put latest Warfare law future law  s structure  foreign  foreign  shoot things milliseconds to these  contradictions then Dracula pattern  right  induced weapons  you know  Consciousness  future Generations  foreign  already some scientists are claiming it  has become sentient  artificial model Sanctuary it is  sensitive to emotions basically um  come on foreign  it is thinking faster than you right it  is analyzing much more than you  create this is  that is that is the point  foreign  I feel I've lost my identity  I almost retreated myself from trying to  learn anything  articles  Superior species  we are here to evolvement Generations  now under the circumstances  if you feel redundant yeah or your  thinking is Western  I mean what will happen what is the  consequence or of of something that is  see consequence is very simple if say  first to hit  the biggest impact to education system  um  foreign  [Music]  if jobs jobs and area of specialization  okay okay  generated machines  below if you self generated  energy generated  so basically they can do Independence  at much cheaper costs  [Music]  um  you know Sovereign  every professional course will get  affected they become redundant  is  so in other words  foreign  foreign  who will give a completely new  possibility foreign  it is making a perfect world basic basic  point of  correctly  without AI choose with AI manishing next  step is  necessity creates a scope and space for  Revolution and everything correct so I  feel we have lived without AI hence you  are like that I'm like this correct  suppose we start living with AI how do  you know what facet of you which is  undiscovered unexplored untapped on  foreign  phone is also here correct in the  context message  you know  so foreign  phone is not replacing us  it is giving us opportunities on  speeding up our work and this and that  everything right you know  phone  but a is coming to that stage whatever  you do it will do better than you people  for example Netflix  foreign  you're not understanding is you're right  absolutely your question is very good  and right  because  Android English in the it studied the  general thing what's happening in Russia  in America at that time capitalism  communism difference  freedom of individual versus state only  in the injured elantecon studies  studies you see than application point  of feeling  theories  which is what everybody does  foreign  foreign  thank you but now we are living in fear  of being taken over correct by AI  similarly  about apes in Chi human beings  amphibians 60 000 years back oh Homo  sapiens yeah  but the basic Point remains is human  beings cannot you know human beings  foreign  foreign  system  s  it is done only by operational  machine but if the bank starts thinking  Bank starts thinking yeah  that is when it's called sentient got it  got it I'm I'm just throwing two  possibilities  emergence of new possibilities  from something that is away from or  Beyond a yeah okay which is completely  not in history at all ah  I feel ultimately as long as the  decision making is with best with human  beings  [Music]  if I'm offering something where man is  not able to cope up and catch up with it  it'll again still become redundant happy  um  because they are not able to catch up  with the pace because they don't trust  it or there are 10 other options  I'm saying eventually two things will  decide the future of aimo one is  emergence of other new possibilities  which AI will also have to catch up two  demand and supply how much of demand is  there for AI for whatever reason yeah  is  just because of this thing  every human being is always looking for  getting the best of Life at the cheapest  cost these two actually run the economy  of any any country or any society right  okay  that it is making those two a  possibility right you can do it for Less  cheaper and faster  and it is better than depending upon a  human being right ok so in that context  the human beings become irrelevant  mean  in the context of that you will  disappear because you won't know what to  do you are not wanted yeah  all these are we you are being wanted  for the purpose of the economy that you  are useful to them to make money  to advance to whatever the your reasons  are but I any good age is  left out of the system of the dominant  system of society  alone  completely underdeveloped yeah fair  enough what happens to those using it  who  hey  that's the whole point  he  what what nobody is able to imagine  actually space  I don't even know how it is going to be  eventually  yes  thank you  but it doesn't move anywhere it is there  virus doesn't even know that it has a it  has it has a life the the context but  digital  connection which is  you can give one single order  technically it can do something like  that for example you know  so the point is  [Music]  intelligence so analysis for example  Cinema review sometime right Ram gopalma  Cinema reviews  foreign  even now the people who created a are  not able to understand that oh  correcting  I'm continuing the same yeah  um  everybody will depend on the AI tools  tell them what they want to do  150 film will be a magnificent never  heard of film that even you don't know  about today correct points  foreign  Because he believes that is the world's  expert on what is what is not  our idea fix safe  charge GPT inevitably it will give you  hope a superior answer  is  because your education or anything won't  go in that direction because it's  solving all problems  foreign  [Music]  if there are other roadways Pathways to  Evolution opening which we don't know of  now where human beings start opening  other facets of their brain and we get  into thirteen percent fifteen percent  which is thinking with much more bigger  brain than what we are thinking  using is not the point  operative centers so they will realize  this is the pleasure Center this is  cognition this is X this is why honey if  for example  okay  great poison okay one one milliliter  whatever size size  a per unit poison concentration will be  very different in different things  right you know so likewise  either 20 percent use Jason Adolf you  know finally together  that is a completely biological thing  that has got nothing to do with its  creative aspect of creating things out  of nowhere you know  brain obviously monkey brain  Hindu development because of the data  retention memory retention  you know right  right  it is like you're creating a monster  monster I'm just using the word you know  so after future  foreign  because it is it is not being challenged  anymore it is not being provoked  anywhere to become better and better  Ambitions  to become better than that right I'm  motivational  foreign  foreign  doesn't it  is  [Music]  foreign  foreign  okay  references  it  keeps on giving unlimited options  foreign  and it it does not give the same to  anybody else right  foreign  foreign  foreign  foreign  inferior human beings inferior living  beings come beings or whatever you want  compared to air so so  muscles only teeth on it  but sir technology is always man-made  yes or no but the point is that is a  truth for all time but the AI people are  having doubts because it is thinking  it is giving you Solutions much better  than you  apparently man-made and hey it is  man-made on an evolution level that is  true  um  whatever  [Applause]  millions of years  we are not The Originators of the  universe or the correct species Origin  of Species  we are just plot in the time time close  enough  foreign  just to see what happens  is  you might have an agenda for some reason  or the other yeah  human being conflicts  um  you know according to a is the systems  to take over this is right  you cannot you can argue with the human  being no but whether you will take it at  face value or not  whether you will trust it enough  industry trustee is not the point it's  about on what basis are you taking that  that is because logic is important to  you can see it's a simple thing  he prove  30 years  hmm  foreign  foreign  foreign  foreign  welcome Ella and China either  designated  ground proximity lower Terrain  obstruction 200 miles 100 miles  obstruction  which means it is in control  it is no longer anybody can control it  indeed  land the plane safely in New York that  is the only order it will play it will  it will follow right yeah  no I mean the extreme possibilities are  very fascinating  scary possibility  that is the thing which is nobody would  understand budget so 500 crore budgets  to cinema TC foreign  it would even the latest High budget  films  generation of income is justifying the  remuneration of the Europe  okay  it is just the experience of watching  that special effects whatever it is okay  so remunerations are always depending  and in relationship to the perceived  generation of Revenue you know so  Revenue meaningful right  so are you telling me political  strategies Coulda yeah be dictated yes  hundred percent it will give you the  best option yeah Market yourself yeah  history elections  the chances of you winning or losing  so okay technology  solution giving models  what happens to search engines which are  actually two steps  is just a generation behind yeah  foreign  foreign  civilization and evolution is now  getting to a point where we are  dependent redundant and parama waste  yeah  see the great the Great Pyramid of cubs  for example  that is one of the biggest wonders see  12th and rocks 12th and chiseled things  means  see 400 500 meters this year our time  low cranes live  600 years  [Music]  foreign  technology  so they are not in the same Zone you  know  sometimes  that is  everything comes from imagination in the  corners  a woman  political thoughts  or social society's Farm out and go  China  Central Point in the frustration  everybody should be happy  end users communism  she imagined  a world  where a biocomputer is programming  everyone the moment it is born first  time  suppose  India  foreign  foreign  a professional  mentally diseased people matter so true  foreign  so this book she wrote in 1975  amazing and that is what the AI will do  now it will program Us in America the  program is  a strong opinions yeah  [Music]  foreign  I stopped reading books I stopped  checking anything of Internet aspects  any everything is looking redundant to  me so now okay the question is  because everybody is sounding  unintelligent maximum  advances  particular discussions  I lost interest in everything else  and more than anybody in me  yeah  because suddenly all your special  thoughts are normal  normalized yeah correct so you put the  okay General Hills calls in Android as  fast as possible  education system  that is  GPD time slow  ly school college  because you have to immediately get them  together  because all Colleges and Schools are  very worried about charging Beauty they  don't know how to handle it correct  technology  next question is  foreign  all right it is it is a crime of the  highest order school system immediately  okay it is not important what not to do  sir I want to ask you what should they  do until school  for example you know  problems  [Music]  um  yeah  foreign  special theory of relativity of Einstein  are they either  customized tell it like you are telling  to a five-year-old boy and a chapter  foreign  I don't know if it is an eventuality but  my guess is they don't let it comment on  current events  so we can pretend to be there  yes sir yes finally I'm glad I won yes  but you won because I am not charging  Beauty yes  but a very very interesting  foreign  thank you very much for your time okay  thanks and thank you all for watching  [Music]
