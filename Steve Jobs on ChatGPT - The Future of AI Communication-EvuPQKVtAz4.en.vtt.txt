 you know I had to re-upload this video  I foolishly left a copyrighted image of  Steve  Apple's lawyers then struck me with a  copyright strike notice like  the irony well it's in there right I  made sure to use my own images for  future reference  anyway enjoy good afternoon everyone  as many of you know we at Apple have  always been at the Forefront of  Innovation and Technology  today I want to talk to you about one of  the most exciting developments in the  field chat GPT chat GPT is a powerful  artificial intelligence tool that can  understand and respond to human language  with unprecedented accuracy  it's a game changer for so many  industries from customer service to  content creation but what excites me  most about chat GPT is the potential it  has to revolutionize the way we  communicate with each other imagine  being able to have a conversation with  your computer just like you would with a  friend  it's not just about convenience it's  about breaking down barriers and  creating new opportunities for  connection at Apple we're always looking  for ways to make technology more human  and I believe that chat GPT is a huge  step in that direction but as with any  powerful technology it's important that  we use it responsibly we must ensure  that chat GPT is accessible to all and  that it's used in ways that benefit  society as a whole  I'm excited to see the impact that chat  GPT will have on our world and I can't  wait to see what new possibilities it  will open up for all of us thank you
