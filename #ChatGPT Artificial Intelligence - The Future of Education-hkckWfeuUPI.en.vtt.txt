 [Music]  [Music]  thank you  foreign  [Music]  foreign  [Music]  hello everybody first video of 2023  Happy New Year I want to share with you  something that has emerged across the  education sector  over the last month that's going to blow  your mind and something I've been  playing with for over a year actually  that I discovered through my doctoral  research and it poses many questions  about ethics in in society as a whole  but if we focus in on education the  ethics of assessment coursework exams  submitting assignments students  developing knowledge and so on and so  forth and we're into some unknown  territory that I don't think some of us  are well I don't think we're ready for  so I'm just going to show you  um this portal here called chat GPT and  it's an open source piece of software  one of the founders is Elon Musk I'm  sure you've heard of  um so openai.com now I've been playing  with the kind of Big Brother version of  this software for a long time  and this is the kind of new version  that's free and many teachers have been  playing around with and ultimately what  it is is a an artificial platform that  generates text-based content enabling an  individual like you me student whoever  to pose a question statement write an  exam write a lesson plan and then it  responds and at times uh it responds at  Great length and if you learn how to use  it more sophisticated more to a more  sophisticated level and so entering a  mark scheme for example it starts to  respond uh over time and and as we know  with artificial intelligence it becomes  more sophisticated the more times it's  used by the majority not just the  individual and so when I first played  with this kind of uh simpler version of  the software I was asking questions to  begin with you know is teaching an art  of recite or a science is Progressive or  traditional teaching methods work better  than the other do offset inspections  improve outcomes and so on and so forth  but I've um also been playing around  with things at a more deeper level so  I'm going to just show you and for about  10 or 15 minutes a variety of scenarios  where you might use chat GPT  and then I'm going to show you the big  brother version to finish and I'm going  to show you how it might change the way  that you work now I have a confession  I've been using artificial intelligence  for 15 years a lot of people in the  early days used to always critique me as  teacher toolkit how does Ross hold down  a full-time School leadership job and  manage to write so much material and  it's because I was using this little  fella a microphone and a piece of  software called Dragon dictate and this  was inspired by a head teacher I used to  work with was who was paralyzed from the  neck down and they used to  um or he used to and he still does today  um use that software that learns from  your voice your grammatical language and  becomes more sophisticated over time so  I stole the technology I was inspired  based ideas I got a microphone and I  started to speak into my device uh 15  years ago and that's now software that's  available to us on all our mobile phone  devices and here we are 15 years later  many many AI bits of software have been  evolving and been immersed through the  things that we all use so automated  emails a chat box that I've got on my  website and we'll all see on kind of  large organizations that we pay for for  services for example our gas or  electricity bills and we don't have the  capacity as an individual to reply to  these chat boxes uh I guess as an  organization it's good for efficiency to  engage customers but we get frustrated  that we don't talk to a human and  they're saying maybe in the future we'll  have individual chat boxes and features  that we can use to reply to these robots  but anyway that I digress there'll be  lots of questions that will come from  this and so let me just um fiddle with  this software you can leave comments in  the chat box if you watch it on Twitter  Youtube or my personal LinkedIn page  um you can watch this back recorded  obviously at any time on this link uh  but you can leave a comment to say hello  and I'll put your comment or question on  the screen if you've got anything that  you want to ask me so I'm going to play  with the the kind of baby version of the  software that most people are familiar  with and I'm gonna go work through 10  scenarios I'm going to show you what it  can do so let's just pretend I work  because I'm going to name a school that  I used to work at I want the software to  write a letter of application  um  let me just  go write a letter of application  to Alexandra Park School a great school  once topped the Pisa League tables  I do say a great School in North London  um  you have to forgive me trying to do two  things at once in my work in memory  limited write a letter applications  Alexandra's part of school  to become a full-time classroom teacher  now obviously I can add much more detail  the more detail the better the answer  that you get back so if I just show you  how this works that's taken me 10  seconds or so or a little bit longer  um and this is what I get back so  obviously the dear hire manager I would  um obviously research the skill put the  headteacher's name the specifics about  the job role  um some keywords that are used in the  schools marketing materials  and uh there you go and I you know I'll  have someone's putting a comment here  from Victoria uh use this here to fake a  cover lesson did a good job so I you  know if I was on the front line teaching  I'd be doing this too and you can see my  software's still going  but you think about workload so my five  minute lesson plan it's redundant now I  can do one in 30 seconds the 30 second  uh lesson plan uh schemes and work  um that's another scenario so I've got  10 scenarios for you here  um and Victoria's left a comment here  about faking a lesson plan for a cover  lesson so that's a great example so  we'll do that one next so I'm gonna  start a new chat so you can see on the  left hand side here on the screen it's  allow it's automatically saved I've got  my own login here so I can revisit these  and at some point I suspect this will be  free so start playing with it and  creating resources while you can  so here we go  so I'm going to want a right for detail  lesson plan I'm going to try and be a  bit more sophisticated here conscious of  my spellings as a type  like the detailed lesson plan for a year  seven design and Technology lesson  the objective in 60 minutes  is to  learn more  about hard woods  and softwoods  and I would like the software  to tabulate it so I want it to be put in  a table so I can copy paste it over and  maybe divide the lesson into chunks  divide the the lesson  I'll do the spelling mistakes after  into  [Music]  um  time periods and tabulate the in  formation  Okay so  thinking time press the button and here  we go so let me hear your thoughts on  this one so it took me  a minute or so to think software kicks  It Off  duration 60 Minutes year seven students  with the objective it then lists the  materials I might need  it then outlines the lesson so you might  be working with a five minutes entry  part to the classroom a 10 minute  starter activity two 20 minute chunks  and a 10 minute plenary then pack away  and you can add all this into the start  of your  um  kind of AI kind of generation and let it  respond now the problem with this  software  and I'm sure one or two teachers are  starting to see this is that you you get  what you're giving back and then you can  ask for another response or you refine  your response when I show you the big  brother version of this software you'll  see that it's a much more sophisticated  piece of software and I've been playing  with this one for about a year so  another question here from Lauren let me  just put this one up on the screen uh  how do you download the software it's  free to use currently you don't need to  download anything you just need to go to  chat.openai.com and when you log into  the kind of playground software and you  just need to press chat GPT so when I  come to the brother version of the  website I see it through here but I'm  sure if you can do a an openai.com  search you can find that quite quickly  so let's just revisit this generation so  I'm just going to pop over here so I can  see so 60 minutes we've got a 10 minute  introduction to Hardwood softwoods so  let's assume it's their first lesson uh  this material we've got a video  animation of a tree grown but we have to  obviously go and find that so there's  still a workload commitment on our part  to do that in terms of rewriting the  text right in the plan gone is the five  minute lesson plan it's finally gone  we've now got a 30 second  um lesson plan and we've also got a  comment here over on LinkedIn from  palette  um because it's new open source software  the amount of people using it the server  capacity gets limited so people get  locked out quite easily so I logged in  quickly just before  um I started this little session but  there is a lesson plan for 30 seconds a  minute or so of thinking time uh I add  more detail I can ask for another  response here regenerates response let's  press that see if we get a different  version  and I'll offer it will go and again it  saves at the top right hand corner for a  top left hand corner and I can build up  a little database of ideas download it  re reuse them  um I guess if the software then starts  to charge or it limits what you can do  probably build up a collection of ideas  quickly before things change so you can  see there's a different layout here I  have  um added the tabulate part specifically  in Brackets so you can see here it's on  a listing them and I always prefer  numerical bullet points rather than uh  you know the the kind of black dot  bullet points I'm sure it's got a  technical name  um  so it's easier to find but um it's not  really tabulated at how I would like  so um I would have to  um I can think I can go in here  and I can edit so divide lesson period  time periods  and  divide let's try a different response  the information into  a table format let's try that so save  and submit  I wanted it as a table there's another  one I tried another time and actually  created a little grid so it was easier  to follow but obviously I'm doing  something wrong here and it's not the  end of the world but I'm just showing  you it's  potential and maybe also its limitations  so I'm going to stop that one  and move on to  another demonstration  so the next one I'm going to do I'm  going to open a new chat  and I want to design a  multiple choice quiz  for year seven pupils and I'll edit  their spellings in a second because I  know multiple choice quiz for year seven  peoples on their  developing knowledge  of softwoods  and hardwood it's got my Titans awful  during a live stream performance  but it used to be some quick uh hacks  with some spelling this is what we can  all do today isn't it we used to have to  write these things  uh with a pen remember those days  okay design a multiple choice quiz for  properties that you can see this is the  reality this is how long it's going to  take you to do it we use some people's  on their developing knowledge of stuff  words  and Hardwoods  now I'm going to be more specific here  design a  five question multiple choice quiz but I  don't want to go on forever so let me  just do a simple quiz let's see what we  get back  foreign  so there you go so what I need to do and  this is a good question ethically as a  teacher  you know I I would I think many many  years ago before I started to get into  knowledge and curriculum and schema and  memory My First Response will say well  this isn't acquiring student knowledge  and I guess when we get a student who  copies and plagiarizes content and  submits it and we can kind of gauge as a  teacher when we know them really well  this isn't Ross's piece of work we can  start to expose what knowledge isn't is  learned or what knowledge is not  looking at this my life as a design  technology teacher I should be able to  skim this and know if the AI software  gives him back accurate information so  that knowledge you need to I guess have  a degree of knowledge to be able to use  this software to be able to understand  what's being written otherwise dare I  say you've got students just  regurgitating software submitting it  back to the teacher and there and  therefore  um and then what we have already  emerging is lots of plagiarism software  we're now having to develop this to look  at how AI software can check this kind  of content so lots of Ethics but I want  to not get involved down in that I just  want to do some demonstrations let me  respond to some of your questions so  I've got Catherine here saying um so I  think on the Big Brother version I think  I pay for some credits and I'll check  that as we go into that so I'm going to  do that in about five minutes  um so it might be the foam one you might  want to try the desktop one version that  I'm also using  um Stuart says  um you know the market AI generated  software it also does that  um and I do believe that it can start to  pick it up but again it's a new  territory for us all so something to be  considered but I've seen a lot of  teachers experimenting with the marking  software  for adding in the mark scheme to this  so I might want to add a mark scheme now  to this example on the screen  and I'll enter students assignments and  ask it to mark  um  Caleb nice to hear from you and thanks  for watching let's watch this Microsoft  have purchased 49 of the company so yeah  that's interesting so yeah over time  it'll be a lot more acceptable and then  Paulette's given me a quill but I've not  heard of quill bot let me write that  down  um I'm sure there's others I've never  really explored plagiarism software  um  but thanks for that  um right let's go um so  I'm going to I'm just going to sign up  I'm going to bring something over on my  other screen so I hope you can see this  let me just check my video yes you can  so about a week or so ago I did these 10  things so I've done the first three here  write a job application write a lesson  plan designer quiz I also did these  write a letter to an angry parent  complaining about the school's lack of  homework and underneath the thread here  on Twitter  um you've got all the different  responses so I've just screenshotted  them rather than video them write a  school report end of your report about  Ross's ability in class I describe what  Ross's characteristics are and then it  responds really good for reducing my  workload answer this question so is the  life on mars or whatever it might be and  write a detailed teaching and learning  policy I spent two years doing that in  my last school  um email my immediate team a  motivational Ender term email it gives  me an idea I use it as a framework I  then tweak it and send it out this  almost contentious with people on  Twitter right in the University  application as a student getting into  Cambridge University so that's right at  the bottom  here we go here the quality wasn't no so  good but obviously it's the detail you  put into the chat box first and then my  life as an author  I've spoken my content online and it's  annotated it in text format as I've  spoken so that's allowed me to work much  smarter than most and I have on the 3000  blog posts and teacher talk it one blog  is probably 50 AI content software  because I was experimenting with this  about a year ago and so it raises lots  of questions whether it's positive or  negative again I'm not going to get  bogged down in the details  um here but there's an example I suppose  um let me do one more and I'm going to  show you the Big Brother software that  some of you may not yet have tried so  I'll go to a new chat on chat GTP I am  going to so I'm looking at two screens  here I'm going at the wrong screen right  a detailed end of year not um end of  year report for Ross who is a  year seven people  working really hard in all his subjects  in skills right so let's keep this one  simple let's see what we get back so the  amount of time it takes teachers to  write reports  let's see what we can get back here so  think about all those copy and paste  paragraphs those bits of software and I  suspect a lot of companies out there  that do school reports  this is New Territory for them too and  it'd be interesting to see what software  they can integrate into their current  platforms but also help  teachers manage workload ultimately what  we're wanting is accuracy  efficiency a reduction in our workload  and ultimately the receiver is the  student and parent we want them to get  accurate information at least in this  contextual school reports that  celebrates all the amazing achievements  they've done in the year but also  Identify some targets and ultimately  want to see an impact from that report  so there you go I've got  six or seven paragraphs it came from  it's turned it all back to me in a  minute I can go back to the top Pierce  if you've not seen it before just a  reminder I can press this button edit  and I actually want  uh please  um add I need to ask for please ask a  ad a particular  reference  to let's say something's very specific  coffee so the sport hockey achievements  but let's just see  if we get a reference to hockey  so we're getting the math and science  now I've done this a few times now and  we always get a reference to math and  science I suppose it's a safe bet but  there you go Ross has excelled in hockey  making significant contributions to the  school teams throughout the season and I  can't play hockey but uh it's neither  here or there I'm showing you the  software so any questions about this  before so chat dot openai.com forward  slash chat let me just open a new chat  box for you  um chat GPD I always get the T and the P  the wrong way around There's the link  there  so language models linguistic a bit of  Technology here we've got a reference  here the pro version the most advanced  AI chat box I've not even looked at  um any YouTubes there's an enormous  amount of um press stories and there's a  huge Army of people on Twitter  particularly teachers look at this to  change the way they work and think  so I'm going to show you what I have and  I'm going to also let me dig it out I'm  going to show you a Blog which is partly  AI generated for the first one here if I  just put this on the screen  what is everybody well the first one was  when I wrote for the new year the future  of Education  so it's this blog here yes if you've not  read it yet that's it loading up the  future of Education I've put in the  demonstrations the videos the  experiments all the links you've not had  to look at that all the  ethics the risks and actually an  academic paper from Ethan Malik uh  looking at the the AI chat box from an  academic perspective so that's worth to  read if you're working in the field of  teaching  um and so that's that's that one and I  have there's a paragraph in here let me  just identify it for you  uh there it's me again now so this  content above  was AI generated in my blog it's the  only time there's one other blog and it  was a Blog on coaching that I'm gonna  dig it out it's a 3 000 blog posts  you'll be pleased to know that 200 2988  of them  2998 of them were all me  but there is I think is this one a  coaching strategy so it was half me half  an AI chat box and I was actually using  the more sophisticated version of the  software and I was bringing all my  coaching work together what the AI chat  box did was generate lots of these  questions very quickly for me  and I published it and I remember  receiving lots of positive responses  from people to in the field of coaching  so again interesting this is the  software I'm using I don't know what  it's called or all I know is the word  playground which is there  and I don't yet understand all the  technicalities and maybe someone  watching will but on the right hand side  you can see here and I think I pay for  something  um  obviously I know what I'm paying in  terms of money money but I don't know  what it's called whether I'm paying for  nuggets or responses or word count those  types of things but we've got over here  in terms of the chat software for  something called text DaVinci Curie  Babbage and adder and they all have  different capabilities so I think I'm on  the one with the highest but there's  different ones I suppose for different  purposes I suppose  without my expertise you know academic  or kind of informal writing and you've  got all these different frequencies and  again I've not really played with these  and you can look at the code but what I  love about this  is the following so I'm going to try and  be conscious that you're watching live  I'm just going to kind of zone out for a  minute and just type something  so um let me think about something uh  you know someone can do easily what  makes a great future  well let's think about the software now  the interesting thing I've learned I'm  just going to move my video quickly my  face to the side in the bottom left hand  corner I've got the word submit and I  can regenerate things or switch it back  but I think what I've learned is it's  important I can't leave a gap or a new  paragraph because it stops the software  reading  the text you have to immediately stop  straight after that that's just  something that's just worth pointing out  I then press submit and I get an AI  response  so the highlighted text allows me to see  what has uh what has been inputted by  the artificial intelligence here either  can then edit delete change and this is  what makes  I think this a bit more sophisticated  than the version that everyone else is  playing with and whether you want to and  I think Ethan Malik and his academic  research and what I first discovered  about a year or two ago was that  the amount of work after or the amount  of text I have to write for my books  from the blogs from a doctor research  using technology  to reduce workloads  um  whether we call that working more  efficiently or cheating I guess that's  the ethical stuff  um but if we're reading and using our  knowledge editing responding refining  adding references check your accuracy  surely I suppose it's um our points it's  an open bitter software and it learns so  let's just say for example a great  teacher is someone who is patient and  caring I'm gonna delete the word patient  just leave it someone who is caring  now I'd like to think of my teacher was  a little patient but at times I know I  wasn't I've just taken that away just an  example that you can edit the software  and then you've got C the green and the  rest became unhighlighted I don't yet  know what that means I've not played  with this a lot I'd probably say  well what is a lot so maybe 50 times or  something over the last year  so I'm then gonna just start to look  what I might be writing as a paragraph  we've got what makes a great teacher  an example of a teacher I used to work  with  at  a secondary school so I'm not writing  anything academic I'm just doing a  simple demo  I don't know the next bit I might want  to say Ross is the great example an  example teacher I used to work with at  Secondary School let's just see if it  replies  so we've got Mrs Smith she was an  enthusiastic passionate about our  subject  so you can see here how I'm now  developing an AI response to the chat  box feature that you I guess you get a  limited output whereas I'm getting more  of a fluid kind of q a response  um  so so there you go so there's an example  I can go on and on write a blog write a  book talk about a doctoral research so  let's just put in what is teacher  autonomy or in fact what does the  research say  plus the research  pay on  future autonomy  across  English education because let's face it  it is slowly being eroded  what does the research say  about teacher autonomy across English  education and remember the cursor  straight after the last  letter let's see what we get  and there's my Alexa key off here right  now at the moment  sometimes it gives you a academic  reference and this is where you need  your knowledge and your  yeah let's just see  a research reference  includes and I'm going to stop there and  I'm going to bring things to them  see what I'm trying to show you here  open it's not  it's Crash typical  a research reference includes I'm going  to put Fiesta because I know that's true  problems  so that the the girl is this uh first  name 2010 so that is accurate now I need  to dig into the details here in terms of  the reference at the end 22 bracket 1  33-46 so you can see  so that's playground I'm going to just  turn to some comments  um and  show you some links so on the screen  you've got a coaching strategy which I  would admit probably a quarter of this  was AI generated and I published this  back in May 2022  then the other blog that I wrote  suggests  that we've got something to consider as  Educators is this blog artificial  intelligence I published it on New  Year's Day you can find it on my blog  you need to log in it's a free login to  read it but you can see  the thing the experiments my video  demonstrations it's got the link here to  the Twitter with all the 10 different  experience in Greater detail it poses  some ethical things we have to consider  and I'm sure I've not covered everything  plagiarism  Etc and there's a nice little academic  paper here from Ethan Mullick talking  about the the kind of risks and a little  bit more  so that's there and what else what else  you've got the chat box the chat GPT  [Music]  and then the playground software which  I've been showing you  so I'm just going to look at your  comments  just to finish  um so let's just work through I can see  my good friend Ian  uh is here so Ian's got an Instagram  link here so I'll just put it on the  screen obviously you can't click on this  you might have to type this in there's a  good example of the danger and the tools  to help check thank you Ian two more  examples here clicks away watch you know  one on a couple on Instagram  so thanks for that  [Music]  Jeanette thanks for watching um I hope  I've just gone through a little couple  of things just let you see how you can  access all the resources thanks for  tuning in James any public information  that user copies and bases like the  source of course so it's something that  we need to start teaching our kids and I  think I showed the software to a group  of 200 teachers in Wales on Monday and  it blew their mind and there was lots of  ethical thoughts to be imposed in the  room  [Music]  um  so something to consider for us all uh  sheer thank you for your watching and  commenting I use this to a couple of  days ago and it's unbelievable we need  to learn AI in order to keep ourselves  digital literature absolutely at the  playground I think you go to the  software create your login  um I'm sure you get a personal or a  professional profile and I need to  revisit what I'm doing actually because  I've only played with it a few times and  I've been using it for about a year  um so  thank you everybody uh right so uh I'm  just gonna do that thanks absolutely  positive great thank you James uh I can  now see it okay that's good to see  Jeanette  um a question from Mary  Joe anyone use this with students as yet  there's a good question  and then uh  that's pretty much it I was just working  through all your comments obviously it's  the plagiarism that and the ethics I've  got another one here from palette are  you a plagiarism uh where's here because  you give me two sources to check so I'm  gonna write so I've got quilbot written  down  and now I've got outright  I suppose it's I don't need to really  check plagiarism because I'm not  marketing students work however when I  submit my doctorate in the future I  should consider if I'm going to use AI  to help generate some content uh the  ethics the  you know not legality is the wrong word  but you know what I mean this can be my  work and I need to make sure that it's  not copied uh from elsewhere  so uh that's it it's nine o'clock have a  lovely evening uh first video of the  Academic Year I'll try and do these  regularly I always say this every year I  don't do this on a Monday evening but if  I'm traveling to schools it's impossible  and other than that  um  thank you very much  um that's the future of Education that's  something we've all got to consider and  you can watch this back on Youtube it'll  be on the LinkedIn personal page uh and  it's on my Twitter stream I'm going to  pin this it's already on my YouTube so  share this with people I'm going to  embed this video in that blog blah blah  blah blah anyway look after yourself  thanks for watching and I'll see you  again soon bye for now
