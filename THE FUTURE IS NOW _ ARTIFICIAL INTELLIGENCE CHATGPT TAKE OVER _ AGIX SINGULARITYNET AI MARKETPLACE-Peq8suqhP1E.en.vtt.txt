intelligence is the future in  the future is now yeah yeah guys check  it out I am on singularitynet dot IO  this is one of my all-time favorite  cryptocurrency projects that I think is  going to really revolutionize the  economy and how we look at our everydays  lives I mean we're going to be talking  about you know you you actually go on  the internet now you're already seeing  AI starting to trend on social media  there's been a lot of hype about this  chat openai.com that's basically a chat  gbt that essentially can pretty much do  anything you need to do whether it's the  right code uh whether it's to make  characters for a book I mean make  artwork you name it it's able to do it  in fact I even asked it as you can see  here I wrote I said I need an  introduction about singularitynet and  artificial intelligence for my YouTube  channel and this is what it wrote Guys  it wrote out for me it spelled it out  singularitynet is a decentralized  platform for AI Services it allows  individual AI algorithms to be bought  and sold in a decentralized market using  the platform's native agix token this  allows anyone to access and use the AI  Technologies helping to democratize  access to the technology artificial  intelligence or AI refers to the ability  of a computer or machine to mimic human  cognitive abilities such as learning and  problem solving AI has the potential to  revolutionize many fields from medicine  to Transportation by automating tasks  and making them more efficient however  it also raises important ethical  concerns and questions about the future  of work and human machine interactions  yeah guys this is what it spelled out to  me I could ask all kinds of questions  tell us more about AI  look at this  oh God air  uh so yeah it is free to use guys it is  free so sometimes I notice like when  there's a high demand  um it can sometimes be laggy but overall  it generally works really really well uh  like say here here I'll show you guys  approve it again I need an introduction  for my channel on singularitynet  watch it work  check it out  it's thinking it's thing it doesn't take  that long guys look at that boom  hi welcome to my channel on singularinet  my name is blah blah blah I am a  passionate about potential of  decentralized AI and blockchain  Technology to revolutionize the way we  live and work on this channel I'll be  sharing my thoughts insights and updates  on the latest developments in  singularinet ecosystem for those who are  not familiar with singularinet is a  decentralized Marketplace for AI  services that allow anyone to buy and  sell AI Services algorithms and models  in a transparent open way guys you just  witnessed AI just basically literally  helped me create an introduction for  this video like this is proof in the  pudding and guys artificial intelligence  is the future as you guys could see here  dude it basically this made my life a  whole lot easier and it did it within  seconds  and talk about singular net why is this  important for single internet well  Singularity net is basically a  Marketplace for people to buy Services  just like chat gbt and they will only be  able to buy those services using their  native token the agix token  that is why I am a huge believer of this  project and of singulairnet and the agix  token I think the value of this token is  obviously extremely undervalued  considering that people are going to  need to buy this token in order to use  the services on the platform  that's what I'm really Blown Away on now  guys like I said full disclosure here  I'm holding about 35  000 singular net tokens I do plan on  accumulating more if the price does go  down my goal is to eventually have 50  maybe a hundred thousand singular net  tokens before the next Bull Run which  you know I expect it to happen sometime  next year and I plan on holding it until  at least one dollar guys I'm not not  gonna be dumping on it guys I'm not you  know there's already been those lawsuits  that you know I don't want the SEC after  me  or it's full disclosure here  I'm not getting paid by singular net  they don't even pay for shills not that  I'm aware of  um and uh yeah just a big believer lover  of the project I'm a holder and I plan  on hold it until at least one dollar  guys one dollar maybe ten dollars we'll  see but I was trying to start I will  will start probably selling after one  dollar that's  yeah buddy so more to talk about here I  got some videos here as well to show you  guys  this is more about the chat uh chat gbt  listen  forever here we go  can you write a list of 10 viral YouTube  titles to help invest investors this is  Andy halfell on Tech talk giving them  the credit  s and here they're writing the titles  and then can you write a YouTube video  on Warren Buffett's seven secrets to  successful investing  sure here's a potential outline so it  actually doesn't write the script for us  excuse me Mr chatbot can you make each  paragraph long something crazy add an  introduction and outro in Total 1 400  words it doesn't I'll do that for you  wow  unbelievable  yes you can see right we are all gonna  be jobless guys  AI model I ever seen  and I'm getting hyper obsessed on how to  turn this into a high quality video and  actually get success I love it we love  it here's another guy listen to this guy  this app is mind-blowing and it's going  to change the world guys this has been  trending all week bro all week  it was also co-founded by hey Elon Musk  co-founder  I've got an essay on the ethics of  having Pokemon fight each other  wow crazy now I want to make sure guys  not to get confused here there is no  Singularity net and chat gbt are not  together like there is no correlation of  the two other than that chat gbt is a  artificial intelligence platform that a  tool that people can use in Singularity  net has features and tools similar to  chat gbt on their platform already that  you can utilize and use and you just  have to purchase them using agix tokens  and you have access it's like a  subscription you're able to utilize  those  um  AI services using the agix token and  talking a little bit more about  singularinet I mean dude I'd like to say  I love this project welcome the next  generation of decentralized AI what they  really talk about and I think is a  really important is the vision you know  seeing Larry net is the world's leading  decentralized AI Marketplace running on  a blockchain their core mission is  development of the artificial general  intelligence AGI for the beneficial  technological singularity  now decentralized ai through emerging  blockchain technology creating a fair  distribution of power value and  technology in Global Commons so  decentralization is what's really  important about AI because what Ben  gertzel the founder of AI what he really  talks about what he's adequate of and  what he's worried about is if AI becomes  too powerful if it or if it got into the  hands of the wrong people that the the  the advancements of this technology will  be so powering that anyone be able to  easily monopolize the entire world if  they completely controlled or had access  to this technology so he really advocate  and his solution is decentralization  like this technology in order for it to  work it needs to be decentralized and  the way they're using the way it's being  decentralized is using blockchain  technology  obviously we all know understand we know  what the beneficial AI Network AI  systems focused on making the world a  more compassionate more just and more  sustainable place right now and into the  future so yeah lots is going on here on  the website you guys could all find the  links down in the description uh they  even offer agix staking and bridging of  the tokens so more utilization there as  well and if you guys are curious the  agix token is built on the ethereum  blockchain and the cardano blockchain so  as a cross chain of cardano and ethereum  so yeah look at this Ben gertzel uh talk  about the collaborations with cardano  that's very exciting in fact I got this  very interesting video I want to show a  few minutes of of his interview Ben  gerstal had an interview with London  real and he talked about how you know  talked about artificial intelligence and  how it can impact the world and  eventually how harmful it could be as  well so let's take a quick listen here  business guys once you get ai's that are  massively smarter than we are we're in a  domain where we're not going to be able  to predict what happened that is scary  but that probably won't stop the  singularity  2029 you've got ai's as smart as people  by 2045 we have ai's boundlessly more  intelligent whatever happens with a  super intelligence its mind state will  be conditioned by the earlier AIS what  is AI mostly being used for on the  planet Earth right now runs tanks and  automated gun machines could allow War  to be fought on a scale greater and  faster than ever before selling spying  killing and gambling are the primary  goals and values in the mind of the  first Super intelligence I mean we're  not setting the best example in terms of  the way Human Society is being regulated  right now nor the way we treat non-human  life forms on the planet  what if AI treats us the way we treat  less intelligent animals  you guys just hear that man what if A.I  becomes so far Advanced that they will  actually treat humans the same way that  humans treat sub you know intelligent  animals or less intelligent animals like  you know cows and chickens and things  like that  crazy I wanted to be more compassionate  to us than we are to each other  the attitude of wanting to Foster  connectivity of all sentient beings is  quite important if we can get that  attitude into our super AIS we're going  to be a lot better off guys remember  this Ben gerstle he is the founder of  singularinet of this project  I want people to start deeply thinking  and to start learning and studying and  to be figuring out how they can best  contribute this because I've done in my  own body  an interesting time and I'll be even  more interesting  wow guys definitely a very inspiring  video you guys definitely should check  it out londonreal Dr Ben gertzel uh like  say I can send you guys the link here as  well  uh link speed down in the description  so yeah guys let's get in on this  project guys do your due diligence do  your research get involved uh you know  what I'm doing is you know I'm paying  attention following them on their  Twitter account you can follow them on  singularitynet underscore.net  uh you join their their uh platforms on  Telegram and Discord  I think

is 28 million and it's  tradable on binance and picked cake swap  wow  don't know anything about this project  though other than it's a fan token it's  on the binance smart chain  and maybe this has something to do with  the World Cup maybe that's why it's  trending  Santos  oh what did I say what what what yeah  it's trending right now  that's why we're seeing some excitement  on this project here it's up ten percent  today we did see this hit 18 dollars  wow this thing went up from 18 to six  I don't know maybe this is a bot dude  this might be a bottom here folks we  might have found a gem here  I don't know we'll see  [Music]  what I wish I would have bought this at  five bucks  yeah the time that bought this was two  days ago  when it dropped down to five  good good uh good catch there guys good  good find uh how much does it cost well  yeah six dollars 24 cents now  singularinet yeah we'll talk more about  singular net bar token  [Music]  uh what is Bart see you guys are on  these fan tokens I mean they are  trending right now you got the World Cup  going on uh this was built on the chill  is blockchain that's pretty  um price is way down maybe it's time to  buy this one too Mark cap is 19 million  it's listed also on binance  Check City token dap thanks  what city token  City sinverse City Coin  uh you're probably talking about this  one the Manchester City fan token you  guys are all into these fan tokens right  now I see  AI of the future yup any pte  recommendations uh the one I was was  playing uh previously in my streams was  monstera I was playing monstera that was  a fun one yeah it's got the mstr tokens  it's trying to 18 cents right now  actually when I made that videos like a  week ago it's been fluctuating guys it's  been fluctuating between 18 19 sets made  20 cents there  it kind of seems like it's steadily  going down slowly but chart doesn't look  too bad doesn't look too bad it hasn't  rugged yet that's for sure  scary future what humans gonna do in 40  to 50 years lifetime yeah absolutely  what up Doge  yeah I got some Doge  check  ilv token  [Music]  I'm not holding any City  first time chatter bet Fury enthusiasts  welcome  thank you for joining  love bat Fury  it's one of my favorite casinos  we're your top three tokens right now  besides agix  I would like Dome I like uh everdome has  been going up  here's everdome  this is this hasn't been this was been  going kind of slurred to go up  and there's been a lot of uh  good news about everdumb and being  released you can see the last three  months have been looking pretty good  so everdome's won I've been buying uh  agix obviously  that would be the other one you know  look at the last three months  that actually doesn't like we hit 11  cents yeah I would think we would be  getting more a little  excitement here  not a low market cap though low Mark cap  means you know just  I mean last month though looks pretty  good  uh let's look at another one fetch AI  this is another AI artificial  intelligence platform this Market Cap's  only 76 million  look at this this one's also  I think is going to be a good long-term  hold guys  another low Marquette this one's a  similar this is that another one  similar to our Singularity net the I am  also holding as well so those are those  of you may be my top three picks right  now guys  and maybe Doge  how do you say a token is on a rug pool  I didn't say any token was  you can't that's why it's called a rug  pull guys a rug pull means yeah it's  completely like  boom out of nowhere I'll show you  example of rug pull FTX  this is what a rug pull looks like guys  boom that's what a rug pull looks like  when the price just completely goes from  whatever XXX to basically zero  within like overnight that's a rug pull  Luna classic  another kind of example of a rug pool  the most the perfect example of a rug  pull is the squid game  that's a rug pull there guys okay  completely rugged wow that was huge  crazy  mange rug pull I think so yeah in fact I  have a project  that looks similar to Mongoose coin and  I did buy some I bought some  um I'm gonna make a little video It's  called creepy dough currency  um it probably is a rug pull to be  honest it's probably they probably will  end up rugging I don't know for sure  like I said I don't know guys I don't  know I literally just found them on  Twitter uh after I saw them trending  about Creepy Dell likes that more on  this later guys I'm gonna make a video  about this  but um  yeah I I think Mongoose rubbed yeah  [Music]  can you check game loot it's like a scam  [Music]  loot  um  it's not a coin market cap  aim loot  I don't know what this is guys  oh SEC registration Securities and  Exchange Commission fine for game loot  insider trading Corp so is it like a  stock what  pre-owned Council  [Music]  oh game Lou offers the most convenient  way to buy and sell games online in  India  [Music]  AIX s token  what is that  no it's agix  Singularity net  remember guys no Financial advice here  do your own research  foreign  not advising any of you to make any  financial decisions  check GTO  gift o down eight percent today  it's not a beacon chain BNB who uses bet  who uses bet 2 really seriously besides  CZ  I don't know guys this one looks like  trash  it's been out for a while  um started off pretty high and it's kind  of just been shitty ever since I don't  know guys  I mean it did go from one penny to  10 pennies you get 10x maybe on this  maybe I miss playing poker dude I uh I  took a break from poker  I could check my uh referral bounce I'm  waiting for my referral balance to go  back up  and then we can play again  never remember my password on this I got  so many passwords for everything so yeah  here's my coin uh poker  let me check my referrals here  all right so yeah guys using my referral  link definitely helps support the  channel and I got all these my referrals  that are the all the people that signed  up under me  I got 31 guys I made 4 500 so far so  thank you guys all for the love and  support appreciate that  that's really that really helped me a  lot guys really helped me a lot  I was able to pay the bills  so yeah I got 31 34 not quite I want to  get once I get over a hundred dollar  balance guys I'll probably start playing  again  holding BTC or eth those are your best  too guys  you know only only uh Financial advice I  give you is buy Bitcoin foreign  erc20 bet20 yep  what else somebody mentioned I heard  gift what was the other one  GTO TRX Ray what's Ray  oh radium I've heard this  uh this was a decentralized exchange  like a swap Exchange  I believe was on Solana I believe this  was the Solana  swap  well the price of this is way down guys  way down that is  crazy  Solano it's so yeah  if you think Solana is gonna rebound and  retrace recover whatever this might be  one you might want to consider also  looking into as well  thought listed on finance Kraken pancake  swap God there's a lot of opportunities  out there folks  a lot of good buying opportunities  check PSG  Paris Saint James these fan tokens this  one's up 28 oh yeah it's got the three  sixes well now it's 665.  um  wow  we see this this thing went up above 50  dollars guys  crazy  [ __ ] fan token  there you go this is also on the Chili's  Network  so we're seeing a lot of these little uh  fan pages and  uh dowels and Colts and all this stuff  being built on all these blockchains  it's pretty cool what's coinbase is it  similar to binance it is it is it's  coinbase is one of the most popular  exchanges in the world it's heavily used  in the United States because it's it's  from the United States it's based United  States it's well regulated because it's  in the United States uh they can't do  any funky business or they'll go to  prison  um  so trustworthiness I keep my some money  on there but like I said you it is a  centralized Exchange  so  you're ultimately trusting them to hold  your keys so just bear that in mind  you know FTX was comparably or was uh  had a reputation a good reputation and  being considered trustworthy website and  we saw what happened with FTX so just  bear that in mind guys bear that in mind  like I said I use coinbase personally I  don't keep a whole lot of money on there  all at once though I'm you know only  what I can afford to lose if something  bad happens  best thing to do is keep your crypto  offline keep your crypto in a wallet in  which you hold the keys of  if you don't hold the keys you don't own  the crypto that's the bottom line guys  bomb line invest in gold yeah dude uh  gold has been going up  let's go let's look at the gold price  when I bought gold guys  I'm gonna be embarrassed here I bought  gold at the top here  I bought gold when it was at two  thousand dollars  over time  gold has been steadily going up and you  know there's talks about bricks Russia  China India  South Africa uh Brazil all these  countries are talking about making gold  their like reserve currency like they're  gonna build a currency essentialize  currency that's gonna be backed by gold  so they are accumulating gold gold is I  think gold is not a bad investment  opportunity me personally I'm invested  in gold as well so full disclosure there  I got like five thousand dollars worth  of gold at least that's how much I spent  it's probably worth like four thousand  now  uh based off of these prices here  like I said I I bought the top guys I  bought I literally bought at the top  which was you know it was right after  the the Ukraine uh Invasion happened I I  was it price was going up really quick  and I went ahead and bought some gold at  probably the worst time  but  I think still long term it's not bad not  a bad thing to get into speaking of gold  uh or speaking I saw Trump here this is  a trump gold token uh Trump believe  they're not Trump has their own freaking  nft collection guys collect  trumpcards.com I'm gonna make a video on  this as well be posting it here on  YouTube here later on  yeah  it's crazy  Rocky wait Rock what up  still holding Matic yes I still got  Matic  Solana yeah I think slot has been uh  still trained down at the low lows 13  yeah yeah it's almost hit 14 now  so it looks like it might be hitting the  bottom here soon guys  again I think we're getting close to the  bomb on Solana  I hope so at least I am holding some  Solana I'm not gonna lie  check lever token  leverify  ramp D5 has been reband into leverify  with lever as the new token ticker so  they got a new token here it's got 57  million Mark Cash train less than a  penny  it's on binance uni swap gate.io  it's been pumping though  this might not be a bad one to look at  there's a good one founded by my team  our team I don't know get my viewers you  guys are presenting to me I'll call you  guys my team  a permissionless on-chain leveraged  trading ooh  another GMX type remember we saw GMX GMX  is a leverage it's a decentralized  leverage trading platform this is what  GMX is  and we look at the price of GMX this  thing has been steadily going went from  15 to 50 that's a 5x guys  this thing has 5X  then the last five uh within the last uh  year or so  so  lever being the same thing follow the  same path Maybe  looks like it's already dumb actually  we'll see  we will see check check apt token oh  aptus yeah I got some aptus  definitely bought snap this train at 472  now wow  it's getting prices getting low it's  getting cheap  somebody mentioned scam don't invest  I'll expose y'all scam alert there are  no aptus coin apt issued on BNB smart  chain or pancake swap yet there's no apt  airdrop on the BNB smart chain do not  interact with any fake apt okay guys  that doesn't mean the project is a scam  that just means there's copycats  like some people just don't know what  they're talking about there is aptus on  pancakes it's using the abscess Network  fun better shut up if you know nothing  then showing yourself like a clown shove  clown guys there's people that just  don't know what the [ __ ] they're talking  about  they he is correct there there is no BNB  smart chain or block there is none you  don't buy this on pancake swap guys  that's why you use coin market cap  oh look there actually is never mind I  lied you can buy this on pancake swap  it's listed here guys just make sure you  use the correct uh smart contract which  I don't know what the smart contract  address is because it looks like they  have their own contract that's confusing  that's actually is confusing  what is the Smart correct smart contract  for aptus I what I would advise guys is  don't buy this on pancake swap  because that's I bought mine on binance  us  I wouldn't buy this on pancakes so I buy  this on coinbase buy this on binance  um and then figure and then figure out  how to withdrawal using their own wall  because this is their own blockchain  guys  [Music]  that would be my advice  I'd be were I'd be I would be cautious  buying the pancake swaps token because  it's the contract the contract address  for the bnb's chain is not listed here  until it's listed here I wouldn't trust  it  my hot photo here oh yeah watch out  beware the spam guys  got some spammers hitting our uh  hitting our live chats here  yep appreciate you guys thank you guys  all for being here thank you all for the  love and support we're up to 70 likes  now thank you guys appreciate those  likes hitting those likes somebody  mentioned zilcoin  not looking too bad guys not looking too  bad I I do got some Zill I also got some  uh  somebody mentioned uh Litecoin  definitely got Litecoin I like Litecoin  like coins Litecoin actually been  rally in here a little bit in the last  month or so look at that  I'm from 58 to 80.  it's up  it's getting up there guys  all right guys I'm gonna get started  here I got a few more reviews to do here  so I'm going to go ahead and record this  now  all right all right guys DJ life you're  here I got a video here for you so what  really caught my eye there's this new  crypto project that came out but I want  to First explain to you how this crypto  project got started so here is Wendy O E  uh she posted this is what happened with  the the Congress when they were giving a  uh Congress meeting a congressional  meeting about the FTX claps and this is  what one of the congressmen said about  crypto listen what he had to say  I wonder if you would support it a  resolution that I've been thinking about  introducing  um  changing the name of cryptocurrency to  creepy dough  currency creepy dough currency  okay uh I'll I'll leave that skill set  to  the committee to the commit so guys this  all right Emmanuel Cleaver is a  congressman he said maybe we should  change cryptocurrency to creepy dough  currency well guess what these guys  thought of you know they came up with oh  let's just go ahead and make our own  crypto called creepy dough currency now  so this is a meme coin guys this is a  meme obviously people have been trending  uh This creepy dope currency because of  what Emanuel uh Cleaver said about it uh  this is a similar situation that  happened with a project also known as  Mongoose coin  uh when the uh Elena was Sherman  Congressman Sherman said something about  ma what can Mongoose coin do to crypto  so these guys came up with a mongoose  coin a literal Mongoose coin and  believer or not guys believe it or not  you guys can see the market cap is 713  thousand dollars this went up guys went  up with over a hundred million dollar  market cap before it pretty much rug  pulled to zero so please bear that in  mind guys you guys to see this obviously  the chart here looks like crap ended up  the project ended up dying it was a meme  that faded away so keeping that bear in  mind I am not given any Financial advice  here to you guys  uh but uh  I am kind of interested in this project  now because I saw what it did with what  Mongoose coin did and I saw and could  see this potentially becoming something  similar to what Mongoose coin did so  there is their Twitter account I found  it here and I started doing some more  research uh turns out they do have a  telegram group guys uh you could join  their telegram here  uh  and they got over 500 members in their  Telegram  oh you guys see that guy got 74  followers here on their Twitter account  you can follow them at CDC underscore  ERC and then here is a chart of the CDC  coin that you can actually purchase  according uh to I think it's also on  it's on uni swap here on the erc20 but I  think there's also a pancake swap  version I don't know if the if the  pancake swap or the be at the BSC uh or  the bet 20 version is the same is is the  same uh team as the erc20 I would have  to do more research on that but I did  find the website guys this is the  website  creepydocoin.com  and check them out yeah it is listed  shown here on uni swap uh we are about  to change the name of cryptocurrency to  creepy dough currency  uh what's the project about forget  cryptocurrency the new wave is creepy  dough currency Emanuel clever was uh  Cleaver was born on October 26 1944 in  Waxahachie Texas  uh he grew up in the public housing in  Wichita Falls Texas uh Cleaver  represented a district that includes the  southern three-fourths of Kansas City  including all the cities south of the  Missouri River as well as the more rural  counties of Lafayette Ray and Celine  east of Jackson he is the member of the  democratic party and chair of Congress  Congressional Black Caucus from 2011 to  2013 and all he did before was simply to  prelude for the announcement of the  creepiest doe ever CDC so you guys see  this is the contract address here  they do have zero total sale tax uh zero  percent buy tax as well I do love that I  hate taxes guys I think sales tax and  buy tax is so stupid uh so glad to see  that  uh it's very easy to buy like say you  just create metamask uh you purchase  with eth uh you could do the swap on uni  Swap and you can actually show it here  where you could go on uni swap to do the  transaction as well  yes I understand yep CDC trade with your  eth voila so yeah I actually had like  two I bought .1  eat worth a CDC my goal guys is I'm  looking to potentially turn it into like  a 5x or 10x uh based off of the charts  that I'm looking at here this is the  chart uh this is a deck screener this is  the BSC version like I said I don't know  if this is the same project or not but  this is the uni swap version this is the  actual project the CDC according to this  website on UD swap  the market cap they're only listing the  market cap here as like seventeen  thousand or something like that if you  go on their uh telegram group I think  the last time I saw was at 50 000 Guys  these are really really low market caps  guys it this thing could go nowhere or  to somewhere very very very fast  so like I said to me this this is a this  is a lottery ticket to me it's either  gonna go 100x 10x 5x which I'll plan on  selling at least 5x uh if it starts if  it hits 5x like around this range here I  will start selling uh but yeah it could  also go to zero so bear that in mind  please be safe out there do your due  diligence and stay tuned for more I'll  see you guys on the next one peace  yeah do your due diligence on this one  guys play safe like I said I I bought  some right here  I'm just hoping maybe for a little  bounce we could see a bounce into this  range and then I'm gonna sell it I mean  that's ideally what I plan on doing  you gonna play today no probably not  today  uh so yeah I got a video there I got one  more video I want to talk to you guys  about remember I talked to you guys  earlier about the Trump nft collection  yeah this is it guys uh definitely gonna  need to make a video about this  so here we go  oh boy here we go got another one
