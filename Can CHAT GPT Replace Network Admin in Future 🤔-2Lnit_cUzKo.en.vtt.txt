 hi there this is Abhishek here and  welcome back to my channel nowadays I am  listening about one very popular  application that is called a chat GPT  and does chat GPT have abilities to  replace the network admin in the future  or does chat GPT can help a network  admin in the future to configure our  routers and all everything we're going  to discuss in this video so make sure to  watch it till the end by the way this is  a chat GPT I have already installed on  my Apple laptop and here I am going to  run the few commands that we basically  use to configure a router in a network  and let's see whether it is able to give  the correct answer or not so let's start  with the basic commands and all so first  question I am going to ask this chat GPT  about a subnetting that is my personal  favorite Topic in Cisco CCNA and the  question is going to be very very simple  so let's click on new chat  and the question is what is the subnet  mask of  172.168.10.0 18. I know it is very very  easy to answer but let's see whether  this application is able to answer it or  not or how this application is answering  this particular one question and cool as  here you can see it is able to keep the  correct answer the submit mask of one  simulator 168 or 10.0 18 is  255.255.192.0 it is not only telling you  the answer but it is also explaining you  how this answer came here so this is a  very good application if you are a  student if you want to learn Cisco CCNA  and if this application can save you  lots of time to search for the correct  answer by the way let's ask some  different questions  the next question I am going to ask  about some networking commands that is  for example how to configure telnet in  router via command let's see  OMG can you believe this guys see it is  giving you the exact step by step  tutorial on how to configure telnet in a  router even all the commands and voice  command is used for what everything is  explained here so this sound really cool  now let me ask few more questions now  this time I am going to ask again about  some commands in a networking that is  how to configure DHCP in a router via  command let's see whether it is able to  give the correct answer or not  okay configure terminal cool  DHCP pool okay nice  full name correct  default router cool  brilliant  nice it does a really great job now this  is only three questions I have asked as  of now I have made a list of 10  questions and we're going to ask each  and every question but as of now if you  are enjoying this video it is hit the  like button and if you are new to this  channel do subscribe it right now the  next question what I'm going to ask it  let's give it some little difficult task  the question is to create 590 subnets  with 60 host per subnet from the network  172.29.0.0 you will need to determine  the appropriate submit mask to use let's  see whether it is able to give the right  answer or not our first priority is we  need 590 subnets with at least 60  available host  before going forward I would like to  tell you there is a year and sale going  on on our complete Cisco CCNA course  that is especially designed for  beginners the courses available in two  languages English and Hindi so if you're  interested in Cisco CCNA and if you want  to learn from me this is the best  opportunity for you so click on the link  given in the description section below  and end all the course right now before  the offer gets expired  and finally we have got the answer and  the answer is absolutely wrong yes it is  does the quite good job for explaining  the things and all but this is not the  correct answer because to get the 590  subnets at least we have to borrow 10  Beats from the horse and if you borrow  the 10 bits the seven mass is going to  be  255.255.255.192 but here we're getting  not that particular once a bet mask so  this is not the correct answer so what  does it mean jgpt is doing a great job  but it is not showing you the accurate  answer let's try some another question  uh let's ask him to configure reap that  is a very easiest and old routing  information protocol right so configure  reprotocol on a router with network  10.0.0.020.0.0.0 so in this network we  have four router and I am asking the  chat GPT to configure rip protocol okay  so let's hit enter  go to Global configuration mode and  after that enable router rip okay next  okay at the network all the network we  have to add here  okay edit event 40.000. is also added  save the configuration  and that's it nice so it is able to  configure the routing information  protocol right and it has given you all  the commands that is required to  configure rip in a router so guys as you  have seen how cool is chat GPT and if  you want to practice Cisco ccnn then  definitely this one application is going  to be very very useful for you there is  a good news for you there is a year and  sale going on on our complete Cisco CCNA  course it is especially designed for  beginners the course is available in two  languages English and Hindi so before  the year get ends go and enroll the  course right now check the link in  description section below and I will see  you inside the course thanks for  watching
