 oh wow it's doing a whole song haha  okay  I did not expect this I'm kind of  shocked  this is chat GPT is groundbreaking new  technology I'm just going to dive  straight into it and show some examples  of how I've been completely astounded by  how powerful it is without going to too  much detail on each individual uh prompt  and usage and response let's just smash  some out and there'll be different ones  that every person will relate to which I  think is actually something to consider  if you're going to show this to someone  consider what they would want to get  value out of it and uh or how they would  get value out of it and for example if  you've got a friend with a small  business ask for a business  advertisement uh describing their  business we'll do an example of that and  then they'll go oh wow that's a good one  now I want to use it but if you go to  someone that doesn't do programming and  show them something about algorithms  they might they'll just go huh like  it'll be over the head so  um  yeah take that into consideration if you  want to get people excited about this  but I'm just going to go through and  smash a whole bunch of things and  hopefully there'll be something there  for everyone  um all right let's get started so I've  got something copied in the  clip uh clipboard here let's go control  V  IA  okay so I've done this twice already  actually and it's given me a different  answer each time both have been good one  I liked more than the other but uh we'll  do it a third time here and I'm just  gonna let it go as you can see it's got  this interesting  use interface here and I don't know if  this is a gimmick or not but it seems  like  it really does  sort of procedurally output the text  which is pretty cool  still going thinking okay it's done  there so if you want to pause the video  here and have a quick little try to just  get that there so you can read it okay  if you're really interested in the  answer for this pause it there and have  a look otherwise I'll just move on a lot  of skim through here and have a quick  look  okay yeah so this uh output is even  different than the other two and it's  got other other things that it's  suggesting uh to consider  um now what's interesting about this is  I can continue on the conversation and  it's not just a do an answer and then  forget what I've said like I can ask it  uh what about a 3D spiral method  which I haven't tried this but this is  what it was this is the first uh idea  that I got for this was to use a 3D  spiral  um  yeah so it understands the context and  it's now  looks like it's going to give me a  similar answer to the first time I ask  this question a few hours ago today  um yeah so you can see and the  significance of this is I mean I  consider myself to be pretty good at  algorithms and I've been doing this for  um like since I was young and over time  I've gotten to deal with more and more  complicated things  um but I I doubt whether I would have  come up with this uh 3D spiral method  um and that I think is kind of what the  value of this chat GPT really offers and  I actually searched for uh on Google  examples of using this 3D spiral method  that was really nothing you know there  was something in there where someone  kind of talked about how to do it in um  stack Overflow but  nothing like this I mean yeah the detail  and yeah um  now I'll take it a step further I'm not  sure if this is going to work but I'll  try and ask it to generate Arduino code  based on this algorithm we'll see what  happens  okay so when it does code I've I've made  it do some G-Code as well which it sort  of works or missing you know was a bit  uh it was a super super basic version of  a uh boring a whole G-Code but it was  correct  um  wow look at it go this is really going  deep  I did not expect this I'm kind of  shocked  still yeah it's doing the whole thing  I can't believe this  I didn't think it was going to do this  well  oh man  well this is uh  this is shocking okay so is it giving up  I think it's yeah it's just kind of like  yeah it's just kind of run out of steam  there I guess I don't know hang on  there's the loop so the loop starts  there  is the end of that function  and then it's created like this other  function here there's no end bracket for  that all right so I wasn't quite  finished it but  definitely a good starting point  um  syntax looks okay  Define the directions of the depth first  search  wow  this is uh  yeah that's mind-blowing I mean yeah  all right let's leave the coding thing  for now  um  but yeah just before I move on from that  I will say  uh I it does really well with robotics  stuff as well so I had a robotics  algorithm that I created and I've done  the code on the robotic camera system  that I've made  um  it took me a little while took me a  couple of days to work out how to do the  algorithm for making all the joints  accelerate and decelerate and finish at  the same time which anyone that's done  robotics you'll know that is fairly  complicated it's fairly hard to do in an  Arduino and actually I've had a couple  of people  um that do projects with robotics tell  me that  it's either difficult or it's not  possible  um with the existing libraries and I've  managed to do it myself so go me but uh  in any case  yeah so that's why I consider it to be  my intellectual property I probably  should  release that to the community you know  am I being selfish I don't know it took  me a while to work it out and anyway  chat GPT smashed it in 10 seconds and  I'm just thinking  it's dirt like I don't know what to make  of that because  yeah what  what does that mean like everyone can  just work stuff out that is really  tricky to work out  um if you've got some idea about writing  programming or  um in any esoteric field of knowledge  basically if you've got some  some base level of understanding and you  just want to get over the line with a  complicated idea you can just ask chat  GPT and it'll take you  to the next little bait yeah what I'm  trying to say  it'll help you get over the line with  whatever it is that you can't quite  figure out  um  so yeah the chat gbt worked out  what I consider to be intellectual  property of make Tech  uh took me two days to work it out  it took me two days to work out the part  that I couldn't work out straight away  uh yeah and check GPT worked it out in  10 seconds and really like  clearly states and then based on this  what I've just done here you can say to  it create the algorithm now create the  code and it'll do it  so yeah we'll move on from there  um I want to make this video kind of  entertaining for everyone not just  people that are interested in  programming  um let's do a business plan for for make  Tech  um start with a simple kind of  open-ended one right so  all right but I'll make it a bit more  complicated right because there's a  ameth Revisited by Michael Gerber  now I'm going to demonstrate something  here that's really interesting is not  only will this be able to make a  business plan that's really on point  it can do it taking  uh ideas from a specific book so I'm  guessing this model has been trained on  any book that's you know relatively  famous  it's amazing  um yeah I'll still demonstrate here uh  we've actually on on emiss um amyth  Revisited it's good but uh yeah Michael  Gerber's more recent work is actually uh  more useful in my opinion  um  so I'll try and make it work with that  so we'll say create a business plan for  a small manufacturing and product  development business called make Tech  it seems to be that his name is always  listed as Michael E Gerber so I'm  guessing that's what the model has been  trained on his name being and uh we'll  see what that comes up with  [Music]  um  yeah  okay so it knows the book he met  Revisited I didn't tell it that it got  that from just having the author's name  in there  [Music]  um  vision  yeah driven by System processes that's  right  that's in the book  look at it go it's pretty big one all  right so I won't read all of that but  that gives an example  um  what's this last bit overall our goal is  to build a successful business that is  able to deliver Innovative high quality  technology products to our customers by  following the principles outlined by  Michael E Gerber  we believe that we can create a business  that is able to adapt and grow over time  and provide our customers with products  they will love  well yeah that's pretty amazing  um  I'll just scroll through this slowly in  case anyone wants to pause and read that  yeah that's quite amazing all right  let's uh test it a little bit more uh I  just had to get the right names for  these books most of these are famous  enough I believe for the model to know  them I'm not sure how much detail the  model has of this but  it knows them well enough to use them  appropriately or suggest how they can be  used except for yeah I'm not sure  product design and development by Carl T  Ulrich  let's make that an and  Stephen D eppinger it's a famous book  but it's not as famous as the other ones  but yeah by putting their names in there  it helps it know which one I'm talking  about write an outline for a business  plan based on these books there's six  books there I've done this once before  came back with a really really good  uh yeah outline of business plan of how  those books can be implemented in a  business plan basically  um  yeah okay it looks like it's  it's uh yeah it's a very different at  least a different structured answer here  well this is quite uh  okay so it's not actually referring to  the books this time  the one I had before was mentioning the  books in the different sections here  so this must be the like a general way  that a business plan would be structured  these different uh chapters I guess you  could call them  but anyway that's probably a bit boring  for most people so I won't go into too  much detail there but it shows you the  power of this uh chat gbt  tool  now I'm going to try something a bit  more different and weird that you  wouldn't think that a uh a chat bot  could do which is create a role-playing  game it's a dragon trying to teach me  magic  and the dragon's 300 years old  very emotionally intelligent and has an  outstanding vocabulary I'm sitting alone  in a coffee shop  what do you do okay yes it worked cool  look how much text it put in there it  doesn't hasn't done this much text  before on uh  okay uh yeah I'm not gonna read that all  out we'll just quickly zip through here  and do a few  um a few answers and see how it goes uh  yeah let's accept the offer and go for  it a  take a deep breath do yourself  steal yourself the magic journey ahead  a gracefully began training  huh ask about the dangers  you're not eagerly feeling a sense of  determination and excitement  I'm ready to begin my training Zircon  you say family I love the name they've  given the Dragon  zero Khan  yeah it kind of looks like it's going  around in a circle here but it is giving  me a lot of  huh this is funny  um I'll just do a couple more and then  we'll move on is this going around in  circles I'm ready to begin my training  so firmly hmm  very well  let's try B  so it's not quite going around the  circles but it's not progressing very  fast  anyway  I mean yeah I don't know if this uh if  this chatbot was necessarily designed to  to be able to do this if it has some  sort of a mode where it does this but  it's doing it to some extent fairly well  you know I wasn't expecting it to be  able to do this and  there you go it does it that's pretty  weird  okay continuing on uh we're gonna go  into doing some lyrics now I've had  pretty good results in my limited  testing with this one  um if you're a fan of Busta Rhymes you  know what he sounds like how talk at the  start of a track and then  um yeah you know his style so see how we  go here uh create rap lyrics and install  the busted Rhymes eight bars so I'm not  saying do eight bars I'm saying eight  bars hopefully it works that out  subject Alpha fold 2 crispr cas9 and the  AI Singularity if you're not really  interested in technology you probably  don't know these subjects  um  but yeah basically there to do with  Alpha fold 2 is uh protein  folding 3D modeling crispr cast 9 is  Gene editing and the AI Singularity is a  proposed phenomenon that will happen  when AI gets so good that every  invention that can be invented will just  be invented so fast that a technology  advancing an incredible speed so let's  see what it comes up with that's rhyming  yeah cool  oh wow it's doing a whole song ha ha ha  okay  it's got the bridge in the chorus well  that's wicked  that's funny  okay  um I'm not gonna try and read it like  I'm rapping because that's not what this  uh yeah it's not what this video is  about but  um yeah I'm just trying to scroll  through that so you can see it if you  want to read that  yeah so that's pretty cool  that's pretty well rhyming uh sharp and  dark can imagine  a bit of uh creative  usage of the words you can make it sound  like they're rhyming  crispr cast nine Gene editing like a  boss  yep cool  I'm just gonna pause for a second and  think of another tricky question for  this oh I got a sort of a tricky one not  too tricky but yeah it's got a few ideas  in here that the AI might be able to  elaborate on and present in a more  polished idea so  see what it comes up with okay so yeah  it starts off by rewording my question  as the first part of the answer which is  a good method to do for anyone that's  uh having to come up with a complicated  answer to something and yeah it's not a  very long result but does it seem  reasonable  yeah past traffic patterns and events  yep  yeah that's good what about social media  did it put that in there I don't think  yeah social media discussing lots of  events will provide the algorithm with  the with information about potential  traffic and road closures allowing it to  plan routes that avoid these areas  so it understands  and understands that concept yeah it's  pretty impressive  it's yeah it's really it's kind of weird  trying to get your head around it uh  understand  yeah where the limits are of this I have  seen it make things up and it it will  confidently  just fabricate stuff I can't remember  what it was but I had something that was  four or five dot points first two were  correct third one just started to fall  apart it was just saying rubbish and  that the maths weren't adding up I think  it was for a robotics algorithm uh not  the one that I was saying at the start  that it nailed but different one was  trying to get a bit more complicated  regarding the timing of the pulses for  acceleration on the joints  um the first part it was saying was  correct but then when it broke it down  into the points of exactly how the  algorithm would work a bit of the uh the  equations were wrong  so you have to watch out for that  but yeah this is pretty incredible  um there's yeah I mean this can just go  on and on I guess I have to call it the  end of the video at some point so I'll  just do that now I guess I just had to  cover this now because I'm showing it to  people  uh and they don't  no yeah they they think I'll just look  at a lady Asher or whatever can you know  you're always going on about some new  technology but this is truly  astonishing groundbreaking  um  yeah I mean you can tell by how the news  articles are coming out it's it's in  mainstream media  so uh yeah I thought I'd better cover it  and give my uh impression of how it  affects you know the way I  use technology and how this will be uh  significant for me check it out and  hopefully this stays on available for a  while it's awesome as well that open AI  is just making this available publicly  like this like what a nice simple user  interface totally free like you can  basically jump on there and just start  writing a book or whatever like you  could make enough posts on social media  for your business for the next like 12  months or something and it's just free  yeah that's awesome so obviously they're  going to get heaps of data back  and moving forwards  with what technology is coming so  everyone's kind of been hanging out and  waiting for uh gpt4  which should be I've been expecting that  to come out this year it should have  come out but we've got this chat GPT  instead was  pretty cool  um and I think what's going to happen  here is the the data they gather from  people using chat GPT will be used  to help guide how gpt4 is made and  finished and  what's really interesting is the  feedback loop which I haven't quite  mentioned this yet in this video but the  feedback loop that will happen by this  existing into other technology  will help other technology improve  faster  but it will also help AI technology  improve faster and obviously open AIS  Engineers can you know brainstorm and  just see you know try out ideas on chat  GPT and it might just help them get over  the line with a difficult thing you know  it'll just uh it's just another resource  to to supercharge their development of  their technology when when we see gpt4  come out  that's gonna be next level to summarize  I've been wanting to do a video about AI  for a while and I guess this is it but  I've considered  um what normally happens with technology  sort of have that the rate of change  harvest the amount of time each each  like major cycle of tech if you consider  what we were at with 2010  the progress of made from 2010 was at  the end of 2019  we're a pretty good spot in 2019 we had  um alphago which that was uh the  beginning  when when AI started to beat people  doing things where experts were saying  it'll never beat someone or at least not  in their lifetime and then we start  seeing it happening that's where we're  at at the end of 2019  . so we had those 10 years so imagine  How Far We've gone in those 10 years and  that was you know 2010 was we'd had  smartphones for a few years you know  decent smartphones iPhone  um  and now we'll probably see that same  amount of progress again but in five  years so I'm assuming and we're now  rough we're halfway through those five  years and now we're seeing some  incredible technology like this chat GPT  so where will we be  uh by the end of 2025  well I don't want to make too big of a  claim or anything but um hypothetic  hypothesizing potentially we'll see what  people call the singularity  happen in 2025 and exactly what the  singularity is or what it looks like or  how you define it  um that's a bit of a gray area but  basically  a lot of technology is going to be  developed very quickly and I think we're  going to see that already we can look  the easiest way to to  decide whether that is true or not  for example with using chat gbt is to  look at how many patents were registered  in 2020 2021 2022 and then we'll look at  2023 and I can almost guarantee  the increase in patents next year  I'd assume it's going to be at least 50  percent more maybe double or even more  than that than the last year or at least  the rate of change will be more because  maybe it's already been going up but  yeah the rate of change of  um of patents will go up  a lot so anyway I'll leave it there that  uh sorry about that last bit dragging on  a bit but I had to get those ideas out  there for anyone that's interested in uh  what I think there's just so many use  cases for this like I've seen people  make fusion 360 plugins not sure if  they've worked but at least it's given  them an idea and some code and the  instructions of how to use the code as a  plugin in Fusion 360. it's just uh yeah  it's just mind-blowing check it out and  let me know in the comments what the  most significant use case you've seen or  tried is cheers bye
