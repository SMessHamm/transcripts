 is artificial intelligence going to  replace yoga teachers welcome to my  channel yoga and fit with Nadine and  today we're going to explore the  intersection of yoga and technology so I  want to chat GPT to find out how  replaceable I am as a yoga teacher and I  let artificial intelligence write a yoga  sequence which I'm going to try out now  to see how replaceable I am in the  future alright let's get started and ask  chat chipity for a yoga sequence write  me a sequence for a 30-minute Vinyasa  yoga class  sure here's a 30 minute even yasa yoga  class sequence start in Mountain pose  tadasana and take a few deep breaths so  far so good move into downward facing  dog  and take five deep breaths  right away down into downward facing dog  okay  step or jump to the front of your mat  and come into plank pose wait a second  I'm already in downward facing dog I  would not need to jump or move forward  to the top of my mat  to come into plan post  um we'll continue lower down to  chaturanga dandasana low Plank and then  upward facing dog  okay that's what he's correct move back  to downward facing dog and take five  breaths  step or jump to the front of your mat  and come into lunge pose  on one side then on the other  jumping from downward facing dog into  lunge pose  I would not recommend that come back to  Mountain pose  from lunch okay then move into Warrior  one for a bhadrasana one on one side  then the other okay come back to  Mountain pose then move into triangle  pose trikonasana on one side and the  other once again I would not do that  straight away from Mountain pose but use  a Warrior Two For example to transition  into that oh wow  um move into half pigeon pose  on one side then on the other okay again  no transitions no guidance and one pose  to the next come back to Mountain pose  wait a second we were just all the way  on the floor in half pigeon and we come  back up all the way to standing then  move into child's pose balasana for a  few deep breaths from a standing close  sit in Easy pose sukhasana or  cross-legged for a few deep breaths well  this is actually the same sukhasana is  cross-legged and then come into corpse  pose shavasana for a final relaxation  which you will need after the sequence  and jumping into your lunges it's  important to remember that this is just  a sample sequence and you should always  listen to your body and modify as needed  also always remind your students to take  rest whenever they need it okay at this  point I have to admit that this was not  the first time I tried out if trap gbt  can write a sequence and some sequences  actually came out pretty good but it's  important to understand what chant GPT  is Chad GPT is essentially a language  model that uses deep neural network to  generate human-like text so what does  that mean it's a database that is  trained on books articles websites uses  the training to learn the patterns and  structures of natural language to then  put it together as new with what it's  known and what would make most sense to  use next that also means that anything  that is generated can hardly ever be  completely new so essentially everything  that's coming from chat GPT has already  existed in whatever form even though the  technology is great and is definitely  gonna make our lives faster in certain  ways it's not going to be able to  replace the Personal Touch or the human  touch so it can't or maybe not yet  replace a yoga teacher with the  qualification and the knowledge we're  having really knowing what comes after  what in a sequence and also spicing it  up and making it more creative and to be  honest that's what I like about taking  new yoga classes is that it's not always  the same thing or very repetitive but  that there is a new creative way of  flowing through the sequence if you want  to now go ahead and practice a real  sequence done by me I'm linking you my  latest video right here stay tuned or  maybe subscribe to find out how chat DPT  is actually doing with meditations  because that's what I'm going to try  next see you then
