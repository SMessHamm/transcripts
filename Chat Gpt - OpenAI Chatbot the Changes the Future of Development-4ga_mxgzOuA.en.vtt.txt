 for a long time developers were  discussing artificial intelligence where  we're going and if our developers jobs  are needed in the future and actually  everybody thought that it will happen  like in 10 20 or maybe 50 years and  actually it all changed when ched GPT  was released last week because this is  completely mind-blowing and from my  opinion developers jobs in the nearest  Future will be either obsolete or  completely changed  [Music]  so just to make it clear from the start  if you want to try it yourself you  certainly can you can just go to  openai.com and register there and then  access the chat as you can see here this  is free research preview which actually  means they released it to collect data  and requests from different people and  actually what we see here is completely  mind blowing in comparison what we had  previously and in less than a week more  than 1 million of users started to use  this tool so let's look what it can do  first first of all it can replace stack  Overflow because essentially you can  simply type something here and get a  direct response for example how to send  an element with flexbox as you can see  we're getting the direct response with  documentation to send an element with  the flexbox we can use justify content  to send it properly and here we have not  only the good example but also the shear  set that we need to write which actually  means it is super similar to stack  Overflow but there you get somehow some  answer here you get the perfect  documentation and perfect example  obviously it is not working in all cases  but from what I tested it really worked  out of the box in ninety percent of the  cases for some libraries I got some old  API but this is totally normal and  actually this is the first point that I  hear a lot people are saying it is not  perfect and it is not ready the main  point is that with every single request  that person is doing here this tool is  working better and better and this  improved constantly let's write  something different for example what is  use callback and we directly get an  answer that use callback is a react hook  and here is the example how we can use  it which actually means you can ask  anything on any topic and get a response  another important way how you can use  this chat is analyzing code and  answering your questions for example  let's say your digging in the new  project or you simply learn a new  language as you can see here I have an  angular component and maybe somebody  does not know what is key of interface  and what this line is doing I simply  copy this line inside this chat and  after this I just paste this code and  here we're getting a lot of information  so in this line we have a variable which  is called columns and by using something  which is referred to user interface and  the array of key of user interface which  means that we have an array of values  that are keys inside our user interface  so actually you can simply take any code  that you don't know from any language  throw it here and understand what this  code is doing and now let's look on the  more scary thing that I see inside this  tool and it is replacing of developers  as you can see here I wrote previously a  component user stable JS inside react  and actually this is just a react  component to render a table inside react  with sorting and filtering and fetching  data from the API and what I want to do  now I want to write inside check GPT  what component inside drag I want to  implement and see how it goes so first  of all here let's try it create a react  component  and let's name it users table which  fetches an array of users with ID name  age properties from this API and it will  be localhost 3004 slash users and stores  the result in user State and this is  what we are getting here here is the  example of user stable component which  fetches the array of users from 55 URL  and store the result inside user State  and as you can see here we've got the  full normal component so here we could  write const and not function but here is  our user State here is our fetch we have  fetch of the URL inside and here we are  setting data inside our state and  additionally to that we're getting the  full render table with the H the head  the body and mapping of the users which  actually means it didn't Implement just  what we asked because we're asked just  to create a component but it really  implement ended out of the box the  component of table because it understood  okay probably we need to render our  table now let's try to improve it a  little bit for example we want to create  columns that we need to render so create  columns array with ID name age strings  also I want to move to body markup maybe  we can write here block to make it more  understandable to separate component as  you can see we don't need to write  anything at once we can just continue  our dialog and this is what we are  getting here first of all here it  defines for us our columns and this is  array of our strings also as you can see  here we are getting user rows component  and actually here I didn't write what  name I want for the component but  actually this name is totally fine and  inside here it's rows users and columns  and rendered all these users and all  these columns and actually it just got  correctly the idea of rendering every  single property of the user inside the  map in this case we are writing less  code which actually means this is not  some bad code this is really nicely  optimized code let's try something else  for example move to head to a separate  component with columns as prompt as you  can see here we just rendered table  header where inside we provided columns  and here inside our table header it  correctly renders our the head and use  columns to render all our cells now  let's try to add sorting and this is  really magical for example create sort  in state with default value as object  with column which equals ID string and  Order equals ascending as you can see  here what it created for us first of all  here we're getting your state with our  sorting just like we asked for but  actually this is not all as you can see  here we are getting sorting as a prop in  side table head and table body and as  you can see inside table head it applied  after every single comb the Sorting  which actually means it rendered the  icon just for the Sorting of this column  with the correct order so if it is  ascendant then we are shown here  ascending symbol if it is descending  then it is arrow down and additionally  here inside the body it did something  that we didn't need because actually  here it passed sorting directly inside  table body and dress sorted all our  users on the Fly this is client sorting  and we don't want that but actually we  can tell this shared GPT that we want to  change that for example we don't need  clients sorting and sorting prop in  table body what we really want we want  to add a certain parameter inside our  URL this is where here I will write  underscore sword parameter which equals  sorting dot column and under underscore  order parameter which equals sorting dot  order to the URL that we fetch as you  can see here we got what we wanted first  of all inside our URL we're getting  underscore sort parameter and underscore  order from our state certain this is  totally fine also here it removed  certain property from our table body  this is exactly what we wanted because  we don't need custom sorting inside our  table body this is now completely out  and we simply render our users from the  back end now let's try to add filtering  and for this I want to write add search  value as a state with default empty  string and as you can see here we  already got more than we wanted first of  all here is our use state for such value  this is totally fine but actually we  directly got here an additional input  before our table which is binded to our  search value and search value because  actually check deputies thought okay we  need here an input for our search but  what we really want is change the search  value only when we are submitting the  form this is where here let's type this  for example red input in form so we set  search value only after form submitting  and also move form to the additional  component with internal state for input  value change search value on submit so  let's look what it does first of all  here is our search value and we're  getting here search form which actually  means it creates fast additional  component with such value and set such  value this is exactly what we need here  is our internal input value just for the  search form and on submit where setting  outside our input value and everything  is binded here correctly now let's just  compare the code that I wrote previously  all this code inside this file I wrote  like maybe 30 to 60 Minutes the code  that was written here is maximum 5 or 10  minutes the that I spent right in  commands this is why actually for me our  future looks really scary maybe all our  jobs won't be obsolete but I'm 100 sure  that we can't stay just like previously  developers until the end of our lives  without any changes we need to adapt to  this new future and actually if you are  interested to know how to build a react  custom table with filtering and sorting  without cheat GPT on your own make sure  to check this video also
