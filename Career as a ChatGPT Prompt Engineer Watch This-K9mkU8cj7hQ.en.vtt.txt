 maybe you have heard it the next big  programming language and skill is gonna  be the English language so why is this I  think it's gonna be a big search of new  jobs that will require people to  interact with AI models say like chat  GPT and to write good prompts so today I  will look at what some smart people say  about this some prompt engineering job  postings and what kind of skills I think  you will need going forward and finally  some examples of work I have done for  some clients so let's just dive in let's  just hear what David sacks the Silicon  Valley Legend the former CEO of PayPal  and a member of the all-in podcast is  saying about a basic prompt engineering  example and how this can improve  productivity going forward so I I had an  interesting you know AI experience this  week and I I think we're all going to  start having these stories to make a  script of how to talk to your kids every  week there'll be some new like use case  that you see that you're kind of Blown  Away by the use case I saw this past  week in a product demo was they were  showing me like an Excel spreadsheet  like a very complicated they could sell  spreadsheet modeling a financial asset  and they had a plug-in to a chat GPT  type Ai and so they just asked it they  typed in what does this spreadsheet do  and it spit out like a one paragraph  explanation of what the spreadsheet did  and it was really good I mean because me  just eyeballing the spreadsheet I could  not have figured out like instantly what  that thing did it would have taken me  like a while to figure it out it told me  here are the key inputs here the key  outputs so that was number one then they  they did something  I think even more interesting which is  they said  give me the formula  that tells me when the yield is above  two percent and this and that and that  and the chat GPT spat out a formula that  was like perfect Excel logic that was  something that you know URI could never  figure out right you need like a super  pro user of excel to basically know how  to do this stuff so it spit it out and  like boom it worked instantly they copy  and pasted into the spreadsheet and you  could basically like the spreadsheet was  much more advanced now so what it got me  thinking about is that we're going to  have these little assistants everywhere  you combine that power with Say speech  to text right because we could have just  talked to it it would the speech to text  would transcribe the instruction spit it  back out and you're gonna have these  like little personal digital assistants  in applications I think you know it's  pretty obvious to see how AI could  replace call centers with you know  having the front line call center  operator b instead of being a human it  could be like an AI but this is actually  even before that like you could actually  I think in every single application that  we use there's going to be an AI  interface and like a it is probably  gonna be voice based where you can just  say to it hey I'm trying to accomplish  this  like how do I do it can you just make it  happen totally and it's going to be  really powerful actually now let's say  about polyhapatia the founder and CEO of  social capital and an early senior  executive at Facebook is saying about  creating a startup with AI you can now  actually get one or two really smart  people like him  to lead an effort  where you would say here's a couple  hundred million dollars to compete with  stripe but here are the boundary  conditions number one is you can only  hire five or ten engineers  and so what you would do is you would  actually use tools like this to write  the code for you and the ability to  write code is going to be the first  thing that these guys that these things  do incredibly well with absolute  Precision you can already do unit  testing incredibly well but it's going  to go from you to testing to basically  end-to-end testing and you'll be able to  build a version of stripe extremely  quickly and in a very lean way finally  let's look at an example with prompt to  ux and GitHub co-pilot from Jason  calacanes an angel investor at Uber and  Robinhood and also the host of the  all-in podcast  it was just a tweet you describe the  design here they say an onboarding  screen of a dog walking app incredible  and you type that in and it gives you a  welcome screen that's like a seven out  of ten then it says oh a way for people  to change their name phone number and  password you know that classic screen on  any app I need to change my thing boom  it gives you that well then at the same  time that people are making text to ux  user interface  beautiful here this stuff will get  dumped into figma but then  there's a GitHub co-pilot which if you  haven't seen we all know it here this is  allowing you GitHub and GitHub co-pilot  GitHub is bought by Microsoft another  one of Satya and nadala's incredible  Acquisitions this guy's like the new  Zuckerberg I mean what a what an  incredible  person to come after a bomber who's just  so effective at what he's doing  as you're writing your code it fills in  your code it knows what you're writing  just like in an email and it's a smaller  subset of information than email email  you could write anything you could be  you know talking to a lover or a  business person whatever here and when  you're doing programming it's a much  finer data set  these two things are going to come  together where you're going to be able  to build your MVP for your startup by  typing in text and then publish it  you're not going to need a developer for  your startup that is transformative in  the world I created this list of skills  that I think is going to be very helpful  if you want to start a career as a  prompt engineer so the first one I have  is strong writing and communication  skills let's say prompt Engineers are  responsible for Designing and writing  prompt scripts so strong writing and  communication skills will be essential  so I think that's pretty obvious right  you need to be a good writer to write  good prompts but you can also find help  anyways only you can improve your  writing of course the next one I have is  attention to details so prompt Engineers  need to be meticulous and pay close  attention in detail in order to create  prompts that are clear and concise so we  have talked about this before like a  machine needs very clear instructions  therefore details can be or will be very  important so I think that is a valid  point I also took down some ability to  work independently because I think  mostly when you are designing prompts  you are working on your own you could of  course be working in a team but I think  you kind of need to be remote maybe you  need to be able to work independently  but I think most people are adjusting to  that now and I tell them some technical  skills so like a basic understanding of  natural language processing and how a  large language model works I think it's  kind of important for a prompt engineer  because you need to know the boundaries  of a model right so you can't really ask  it for let's say emotions write this  script to make people cry it's not gonna  work right so you need some kind of  understanding of both the model and some  natural language and of course  creativity creativity creativity is very  important so prompt Engineers need to be  creative in order to design prompts that  encourage them all to generate  interesting and viroid outputs that is  Kanye what you if you just go right a  500 word article about something that's  not very creative you kind of need to be  creative but you also can learn this by  experimenting a lot right so I think  that is a valid point so I just put down  some how can you learn these skills you  can see here experiment with models like  chat GPT and of course the new Bing and  when Bard comes out or other language  models you can use two gpt3 and stuff  you can read books to expand your  language skills I think that's a very  good point and of course study English  language and there's a lot of other  things you can do I also suggest if you  want to do this create a portfolio of  this effective prompts you have created  that generates say good value or very  good outputs that are very precise so  this can be used when applying for a job  right that you can prove that you have  done something that is very effective so  now let's take a look at some job  listings I found on a prompt engineer  where they are hiring this so the first  one I have his front engineer and  librarian at anthropic so anthropic is  that new AI company that Google just in  Western 300 million I think in so let's  have a quick look here so the salary is  61k to 77k I think that's pretty good I  think this can increase of course over  time so I said like like here they say  given that the field of prompt  engineering is arguably less than two  years old this position is a bit hard to  hire for if you have existing projects  to demonstrate prompt engineering on  large language models or image  generation models we would love to see  them so this is what I mentioned like in  the portfolio so I think that could be  very good you can see a representative  project discover test and document best  practices build up a library of high  quality prompts or prompt chains to  accomplish a variety of tasks with an  easy guide to help users search and for  the one that meets their needs and of  course build a set of tutorials and  interactive tools to teach them the art  of prompt engineering so here's  something they think if this can be a  good fit for you so you have a creative  hacker spirit and love solving puzzles  excellent communicator and love  technical teaching Concepts and required  documentation have at least a high level  familiarity with architecture and  operations of large language model basic  programming and QA skills small python  programs have an organizational mindset  yeah I think that's important you make  ambitious problems clear and identify  core principles that translate across  scenarios okay so have a passion for  making powerful Technologies safe think  creatively about the risks and benefits  of new technologies yeah this is kind of  not so specific so let's say what other  things they have yeah this is just some  benefits I was thinking no that's pretty  much it so there are no like hard  requirements here so there's not like  you need a bachelor you need an MBA  there's nothing really a hard set  requirement here so that is very  interesting that means that if you start  now you build up a portfolio and yeah  you can show that you can do this I  think you have a good shot chance of  jobs like this coming up in the future  and I expect the pay to kind of increase  as this gets more in demand right so I  also wanted to check out this one this  is our AI prompt engineer at the  Boston's children's hospital so this was  a bit different you can see the high the  salary is a bit higher here up to 92 000  dollars a year you can see the  description is design and develop AI  prompts using large language models  gpt3hbt and two and other Solutions as  they emerge for healthcare research  studies and clinical practice I think  that's very interesting so I think this  could be like helping doctors nurses and  write good prompts that can help them do  the paperwork so it says like  collaborate with researchers and Clinic  clinicians to understand their needs and  they sign prompts that will effectively  gather data yeah until then some machine  learning models to analyze data that's a  bit different so if you have to do that  because then you kind of need some other  skills if you're going to do some ml but  you can learn that of course but we are  looking for prompts now in this so you  can hear here you see there is some  other qualities showing their bachelor  degree in CS AI or related fields and  you need some experience with the  libraries you need some coding  experience so here it's a bit different  here they kind of set some higher  requirements for this job yeah that's  interesting but the first one we look at  there was no these kind of requirements  right so that's very interesting but I  expect there's going to be a lot of this  showing up in 2023 that you can apply  for if you are set on doing this so yeah  we're gonna monitor this so very  interesting so I just wanted to show you  some of my portfolio examples of fronts  I have created for some clients let's  just have a look at this one first so  this is uh I had the client create some  basic movie scripts synopsis and  summarizations so these are not the most  creative prompts but they worked quite  good so this is just a simple URL  scriptwriter your task is to write  conversational short synopsis from a  given text so write a short but detail  conversational synapses from the  following text so here I just have my  placeholder for my script and just  feeding like the script in here right  and write a short potato conversational  synapses from the text above so here are  some results I ran this script from the  ex machina movie so here you can see ex  machina follows the story of Caleb a  young programming for Long Island it  wins a competition so you can say  Discord Nathan has built an AI Ava and  Caleb is tasked to conducting a Turing  test so basically this is a synopsis of  the whole ex machina script so this was  nothing from the movie I just took the  Bare Bones script where the lines and  everything and summarized it into our  synopsis of that movie so we can also  have a look at some another example here  I did so this is just a CV template  example I did for someone so you are a  professional CV writer your task is to  create General CV template with user  inputs create a detailed CV template  that includes the following parameters  for name personal information education  experience goals and Ambitions three  best personal characteristics create a  detailed CV template for the inform up  both so let's copy that and run this  over at the chat GPT okay so let's run  that  and here you can see we have a CV that  is pretty simple like it's just your  name your personal information LinkedIn  profile address degree institution  graduation date coursework key  responsibilities yeah job title  short-term goal long-term goals skills  to develop one two three characteristics  yeah so a pretty basic CV template but  the prompt works and it gave me what I  wanted the client was happy and so was I  so so hopefully this video gave you some  inspiration maybe you want to start a  career in prompt engineering or you just  want to explore some more and start to  learn and maybe sometimes in the next  few years become one if you want to know  more about this sign up for my  newsletter in the link
