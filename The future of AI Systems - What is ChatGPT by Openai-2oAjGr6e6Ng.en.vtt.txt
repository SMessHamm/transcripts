 welcome guys welcome back to grow coding  school the school of coding and the art  program so thank you guys for coming  back to this channel if you are new to  this Channel please I request you hit on  the subscription button  subscribe  so thank you once again and uh this is a  brand new video  a video about the newly released  the AI system that is the chat GPT  so in brief chat GPT  let me take you to the browser as I talk  chat GPT is uh  it's an artificial intelligence  chat boot which was developed or trained  by  open AI so I guess you know that  and uh it's released on 30th November  2022 this year we are in and  it's the lines and Center proprietary  get it from openai.com is drop block  structure GPT that's where you get but  I'm going to put the link in the  description  yeah please remember to comment if in  your views what do you think AI could do  so here this is what you get once you  have once you get to the link uh  chat.ni.com  you will come to

or you can create  one and get there as well  so  then we have updates and frequent last  questions  this is where you get updates about the  the system this is managed by open AI  I've chat you could do all things about  GT research review we have all this this  you can add in their frequently asked  questions here we have collection  yes so  today there we have examples  of what you can it can give you the  answers we have capabilities what it can  do and then we have limitations  under capabilities we have it can  remember users said and Report user said  earlier in the conversations it can  remember you are  you are such queries or you are input it  can remember then allow your user to  provide follow-up Corrections so that  and trying to decline in appropriate  request a requests which are not good it  can decline it can refuse to give you  the answer  and the limitation we have made  occasionally generating a correct  information yes we can still rely on  this dog it's good but we can fully rely  on it because some of the  information which it it gives back to us  they are not 100 correct  and then we occasionally produce harmful  instruction to a bias content yes the  instructions that they produce all the  information they give out it cannot be  fully okay  all right it can contain other things  which are not good  and then limited knowledge of all and  invented after 2021  sorry if you are looking for  things about World Cup World Cup  is in 2020. if you want to get the  answer  to  20218 but as I think it's still under  training maybe they will add those  things yes then let's start by click on  this example  let's say but any creative ideas for a  training yeah  false birthday yes click hit enter for  click this button  then you can see it replies  here a few ideas for a 10 year old's  birthday yes  yes it gives you the answers what you  can do  yes  five of them you see them five of them  you can click on try again to give you  another answer  it gives you back other suggestions what  you can do for a 10 year old but you  can't even get like uh let's say for  instance if you are 30 40 yeah in  fifties you can also cook you can also  come here and  it will give you the answers or  suggestion the best way to  to do  to have your birthday  yeah we can clear out the trade country  clear the report here they are turned  now  once you clear that dirt it comes back  to this as I said earlier  for people who are doing computer  science or any other course or any other  yes or any other course  any other question you have I have  question here this is a question about C  programming for student doing students  doing  computer science so let's copy this  question  Ctrl c i of another to come back to our  browser  Ctrl V here  we need to specify the language  otherwise it will give us our outside  python this question is said for C  hit enter  write SC program prompting you you have  to enter three numbers integers then  display LCM of those numbers enter  it's now giving for us there a reply  so after you getting all these answers  you want  a request  that you please go through the answer  step by step and you also try to run the  codes using either a visual studio using  Code block using Sublime Text and  any other compiler of your choice  and you will be able to to to to know  whether the answers are correct or wrong  other the quotes they give or it gives  you it gets the correct answer but it  might not be uh as required so you have  to look through and do changes here and  there  so this is it and you can still click  try again it will give you a different  version of this  maybe with some modification here and  there  we also have another question here and  write a program with two user defined  function one to change from binary  decimal and one from this multiply and  from a user to select  an option from the menu this is a CSC  program  Ctrl C  program question  and just click reset red  and press here  yes specify the language we need to see  hit enter  by default any question about  programming you give it gives you the  you you insert here to get the answer it  gives you the answer back in Python  language  so  now you see that  in the program before  we don't have the math function and now  here it has included the mat function  the header file  math.h  [Music]  boom  yeah he's just given for us our program  and you can just  can't come here scroll up click copy  code once you click copy code it will be  the code will be copied so you go and  paste in your compiler  you choose any other compiler you want  as a Dev C plus plus you choose any  compiler you paste there and you try to  run  then we set the other  as a the other questions which it  doesn't give answers to  say because it doesn't browse the  internet it is not trying to draft the  internet  so what is the  owner of Rock  Recording School  that's what to say  yes one moment  yes you see the reply I am sorry but I  don't have information on the honor of  Brooklyn school I am a language  modeled  trained by openers so I don't have  access to the internet and  don't have information and specific  businesses or individuals  you see that you click try again it will  still fail  that mean it doesn't know my name oh  yes that is why you say it has  limitation it cannot  it cannot cross the Internet it's not  connected  to such  the internet from the  from the back  such that it gives you answers  for people who are there  so thank you guys thank you so much for  watching the video If You Are  in the
