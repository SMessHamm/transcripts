 Paula so we are talking about a turning point of a revolution in progress a wave of cats yes artificial intelligence is there in our daily lives for better and for worse yes a wind of panic is blowing over the whole world which does not  has only one word in his mouth cat [ __ ] a new online chat robot how do you get people talking about him on the Internet he is both precise and very honest in his answers I can tell you that this robot is super useful he m  helps to study by giving tailor-made answers to my questions it's the best way to cheat a good test so chat jpti it's a robot capable of holding a conversation and progressing so I tried this morning and it's  is dizzying you can ask him anything I even asked him to try to write my column and it was much better [Laughs] of a movie on the Apocalypse to solve a math problem in a snap of his fingers he runs  hold for example Chad jibity write to me  a lullaby on the price of gasoline invent me a lullaby on the price of gasoline golden little child the price of gasoline is going up high but don't worry tomorrow maybe it will drop good so that's it yes  it's a revolution we compare it to the invention of the computer a revolution that democratizes decades of scientific work an intelligence within everyone's reach it's rather positive all the same an intelligence that could dethrone Google and yet we think  already inside in the United States the schools of New York have decided to banish this tool as soon as possible because half of the students cheated in France also the little clever ones have delegated their duty to listen to this anonymous testimony obviously because collected the DLCI teams heard  talk about GPT chat on social networks I was immediately a little amazed by the examples I saw on social networks and therefore I want to test the writing it is very very effective because  very structured so in particular it can be for for cover letters for language tests it's very very effective good so you see it makes you a little dizzy it stirs up our fears will our children be less intelligent at school  future because they won't need to learn anything more will Chad jipiti put me and our whole team out of work so let's try to keep a cool head because it's true that the first reaction we have is that  is to want to break the machine a little anyway in 1811 one remember the playful revolt of the English workers it was set to destroy weaving machines for fear that their trade would disappear the workers were afraid of being downgraded exactly as  most French because according to a study according to statista 40% French employees say they are worried about the impact of artificial intelligence and they are right because it is better to prepare because according to the same study and indeed France would be the  the most affected country in Europe according to researchers the study goes even further it says that there is a one in two chance that machines will surpass humans in all tasks by 2062 they will be better than us at translating languages ​​by 2024 drive a truck by 2027 and perform surgery by 2053 but hey will these robots also replace human warmth care and well no not at all and that's where the  intelligence this is where the pardon study is intelligent because it also says that 85% of the jobs of 2030 do not yet exist we have survived the calculator the Internet the word processor we will also watch we will also survive the  artificial intelligence you just have to learn to collaborate with it no the real danger is that this artificial intelligence becomes a private tool the Californian start-up called open AX was confused by elon must is a non-profit organization  lucrative but Microsoft ess  would like to get our hands on this robot, we even say to ourselves that the service could become chargeable and if it were reserved in the future for an oligopoly, the urgency and therefore to legislate as quickly as possible because there is a legal vacuum and for  the moment well the teachers are helpless when they find themselves in front of a copy that was written by this robot they don't know what to do and so they put in me about the average they are completely helpless by this rich so the  emergency in my opinion it is to legislate as soon as possible we see on the networks I do not know if you have noticed for several months photos or even drawings which are as if generated by artificial intelligence are these the same it is the same Californian structure which proposed a robot which can draw art for example I took you some robot examples Draw me the Sydney Opera House but then Claude my way look what it gives you will see we  can also  ask her the girl with the pearl but with a cat for example go ahead go ahead Vermeer with a cat or on the contrary I can't Napoleon on a Harley Davidson well it works too here he is I wanted to ask Paola what that is  wanted to say every Jupiter luckily you know no I'm going to ask the robot if he can answer me after I said no that's a bad question because it's a contraction of conversation and predictive language transduction models thank you  a lot but then last night in TF1 there was a report on virtual fiancés yes that the Chinese are increasingly using these little robots on their laptops it's fascinating because the extremely lively exchanges we can't talk about  of emotion but really they are companions or companions of companions forgiveness more and more present in the private life of the Chinese even when they already have a fiancé from elsewhere and certain st  artups also say that we will be able to resuscitate our dead that we will be able to I do n't know a hologram our mother or our father he was talking to him but what obviously what concerns us is school because I am maybe  be a little vintage but it's true that if children no longer learn anything, that is to say only to find solutions, then we bring dictation and mental calculation up to date, it's true that this kind of  robot it's a revolution in any case the human brain is not able to measure the scope of this artificial intelligence for the moment
