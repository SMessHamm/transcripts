 welcome let's talk about chat GPT and  how it affects Excel we'll go over  various examples of how tools like chat  GPT may help you become more proficient  with Excel and other apps as well as how  it can enhance your ability to create  functions using your data now let's  start off by defining chat GPT it's part  of a new generation of artificial  intelligence products that engage with  you in many ways today we're going to  show you how it can construct Excel  functions but it can also write stories  edit text as well as instruct you on  other items as far as as Excel it can  create nested and even complicated  functions  this tool definitely feels evolutionary  you won't have to memorize syntax or  begin with a blank function thanks to it  users can specify what they want in  English or other languages and the  syntax is constructed for them instead  of them becoming frustrated with excel's  convoluted syntax additionally more  users will be able to employ a  complicated Excel functions which is  beneficial for our community  I wouldn't be surprised if in the near  future Excel gets directly connected  with products like chat GPT just a few  housekeeping tasks before we continue in  the description of this video I'll  include a link to chat gpt's  registration page I also want to warn  you that your outcomes may not always be  accurate always remember that you are  still in charge of testing and ensuring  that anything that you create satisfies  your requirements just like any function  that you create  in the upcoming examples we'll start out  Simply get a little bit more complicated  and even demonstrate a cool feature  where chatgpt can generate data please  leave comments with your ideas as you  watch as we're all in the early days of  AI tools and we can all learn from each  other let's get going  for our simple example we will ask chat  gpt's prompt to tell us how to add cells  A1 and A2 I expect anyone watching this  video already knows how to add two cells  but this demonstrates the basic  functionality including how it suggests  additional Solutions here with the sum  function in addition the explanation of  all the solutions are provided now you  have the choice to take in the full  explanation to learn more or just copy  and paste the solution now please note  that gp2 doesn't just give me a generic  answer that you would find on most Excel  tutorial websites but actually uses my  requested data fields A1 and A2 in the  answer this is why you can copy and  paste the solution with little to no  editing now let's get a little bit more  complicated and see how chat GPT  performs  now let's try a slightly more advanced  example here so what I'm showing here is  a list of four students and their scores  on a recent exam and I want to put a  letter grade for each exam score now  there are several ways to do this in  Excel but let's say I don't know and I  want to see how chat GPT can solve this  problem for me  I know of several ways to calculate  letter grades but let's not give chat  GPT too many hints we will just say what  we want in the prompt I will describe  how I Define letter grades and tell chat  GPT which field contains the numeric  grade this will make the cut and paste  work much easier at the end as you can  see chat GPT thanks for a moment and  then starts to create a nested if  statement for the five letter grades  whether nested if statements are the  most efficient way for every lookup  function is debatable but for a simple  lookup of five numeric ranges I find it  to be a great solution especially if I  had no idea how to do this in the first  place  so as it's now explaining to me how this  works I can go ahead and copy the  statement at the top and then this will  allow us to go back over to Excel and  then paste it in to see if this is  working  okay now we will paste it into the field  here so I will paste it up here in the  formula so we can see it all right there  it's all the nested if statements and  when I hit enter now it's going to put  the letter grade for each student over  in column C and it's always a good idea  with chat GPT to test it out so I will  change John's score here to let's say a  50 and if it's right it should turn it  letter grade to an F let's put it up to  95 and it should be an A so there we go  that's how you can use chat GPT to start  to craft more complex  Excel formulas that hopefully will help  you in your job now let's move on to the  next topic  okay in this example we're going to go a  little bit more complex with chat GPT so  over here we're going to create a  vlookup so that when we're looking up  this value of one I want to know what  the product is and over here I'm going  to match it to this one and bring over  the product of an apple and then with  three I'm going to bring over here for  milk some key points to make is that we  want to bring over column F so that's  what we're going to do so let's jump  over to chat GPT  now let's start crafting the prompts so  the vlookup statement is built I will  tell the program to create the vlookup  statement I won't go into details about  how vlookup works but I will link to  another video of mine that does do that  so I will add the lookup cell I Define  the table and I want to lock the  reference to this table which is  extremely important if you want to use  this function in other cells on here and  recall that I want the value to be  returned is in column F so I will tell  that to chat GPT  and then  we will then the prompt looks good and  oh yes I want an exact match as well so  let's make sure we add that one and then  we will submit this  now the solution is being returned in  this case chat GPT puts the solution in  a black box with a copy code Link in the  upper right corner I find the Black Box  solution to be a cleaner element but as  the previous examples demonstrated the  black box is not always displayed now  not only is the solution return it  explains the purpose of locking or  referencing the table array with the  dollar signs now if you're still here I  would appreciate a thumbs up and if you  like this type of content I would love  to have you as a subscriber now let's  copy the code and move back over to  excel to see if that worked okay now we  will paste the code into the value here  and let's see if it's properly going to  bring in the apple and the milk values  and there it did so right there chat GPT  was able to create a vlookup formula  based on an English translation of what  I wanted to return now let's say instead  I decided I did not want to use a  vlookup formula but instead I wanted to  use index match which is an alternative  version of vlookup so let's see how we  could do that real quick  a cool feature of chat GPT is that it  has a memory now I could restate my  entire prompt but I don't have to rather  since I'm still in the same chat record  I only have to ask for the previous  solution to be presented as index match  so what I wanted to demonstrate here was  that you can keep refining your Solution  by incremental prompts just by typing in  what you need changed or what you want  added so it's definitely not just like  going back and doing a brand new Google  search  now let's jump back to the beginning  prompts and I want to review one last  interesting element of this application  so stick with me  let's say you have an Excel assignment  where you need all of the states in the  U.S along with their population as part  of a larger analysis being a Savvy Excel  user you probably already know how to  link to web tables for data but let's  see if chat GPT can make it easier for  us  so we prompt for a CSV of all 50 states  let's add in the state abbreviation we  can then watch my poor typing skills and  then we ask for the population as well  now the solution Black Box returns CSV  data with what I requested when the data  completes I can copy it with the link in  the upper right that I can paste it into  Excel to use however I want you know I  get excited when I see AI tools that  will change how we do the job that we're  also passionate about some may think  that AI tools will replace us but I see  them making this more efficient and  effective at our real job which is  analysis and presentation you know  please let us all know your thoughts  about Ai and how it changes your Excel  work
