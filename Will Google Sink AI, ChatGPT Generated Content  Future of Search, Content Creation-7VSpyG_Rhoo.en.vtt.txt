 so Google has a trillion dollar uh  problem right now with chat GPT  um  chat GPT and these AI tools allow anyone  to create huge huge volumes of content  you know tens of thousands of pages of  content uh very quickly and so Google  search results are going to be flooded  with really poor AI spam  um Google is actively working on  de-indexing and d-ranking sites that use  AI so uh  a lot of the people who are listening  today they might have heard hey  I need to publish a lot of content I  can't afford a Content team I'll use AI  don't do that you're going to get  penalized you're going to get slapped  your website traffic will get ruined do  not do it for your clients  um I think it's likely they'll have some  sort of chat gpt3 interface it's not  clear how they're going to put the ads  in you know if they went from three ads  per result to one ad per result their  revenue would get cut in half by 66  percent uh overnight and so they kind of  had this innovators dilemma where openai  can make a billion dollars a year 10  billion dollars a year and they're gonna  they're gonna love it but if Google made  10 billion dollars a year they just lost  90 of their revenue so why is it  penalizing what is the reason why does  it not want AI generated content  generally AI content uh isn't so good  um it's just not as good as as human  written content today and then again it  just allows anyone to flood the search  results with a thousand tens and tens of  thousands of pages of uh of content  Google doesn't want people to abuse it  and if one one guy in you know like  one guy in Nebraska is able to create 10  000 bad pages about fish well he's doing  he's actively harming Google's users  search experience  mixed views on that  mixed feelings on them  because I I think the the way out is  that uh AI is used as a tool and not as  as a core content generator you know  like it does one level of work and then  human beings can build on it or they can  do like hey I can do one part of it uh  maybe a I can be used better by human  beings rather than just delegating it  you would think but I mean that's that's  what you and I think but there's you  know there's a lot of people in  marketing that are drawn to make money  online fast and they don't share the  same Viewpoint me and you do what  they're thinking is how do I exploit  this thing uh  as easy as possible to make as much  money as possible without any regards  for anything else  [Music]
