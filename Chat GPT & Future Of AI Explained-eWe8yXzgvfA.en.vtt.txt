 in November 2022 an American artificial  intelligence research company openai  launched an AI chat bot called chat GPT  in just one month this AI tool gathered  more than one million users worldwide  later the said I application became  famous as a chat GPT chat bot and  millions of users started using it for  text generation research and translation  if you ask chatgpt to write about  something it will quickly give an output  in text format which is more likely to  human written content  further you can generate programming  language syntax translate languages  summarize articles write scripts and  more things  this open AI application became suddenly  popular among users because there was no  other AI application in the market that  can amazingly respond to a user's  command and work on a large language  model  one of the investors of openai projects  Elon Musk told in a tweet that chak PT  is scary good and we are not far from  dangerously strong AI  he may be referring to it companies and  especially Google because Microsoft and  openai are planning to integrate chat  GPT with the Bing search engine to  improve better search results  now companies like Google and other  software companies especially online  course selling companies need to worry  about chat GPT  you are watching Babel bulletin in this  episode we will understand how ai-based  Technologies like chat GPT can influence  the digital market and what is the past  present and future of the chat GPT  intelligence model do you love watching  amazing technology and science videos  then why not subscribe to Babel bulletin  for more Clips like this one and ring  the bell for more mind-bending content  in 2015 a group of the biggest names in  Silicon Valley including Tesla's CEO  Elon Musk and CEO of openai Sam Altman  decided to develop an artificial  intelligence project to publicly  available in ai-based mechanism to bring  new changes in content marketing and  consumption they decided to invest 1  billion dollars to develop such an  artificial intelligence machine that can  benefit Humanity as a whole  however many ups and downs occurred  while developing the projects especially  for programmers to establish a large set  of databases and training AI models  must didn't stay directly connected with  the company for a long time and he left  the board of directors in 2018 but he  continued to donate to the mission  finally on November 30th 2022 they  released chat GPT as a prototype and it  quickly gathered attention across the  globe designers have interactively  trained chat GPT models so that it can  conversationally handle any user  instructions Bots dialog format makes it  easier for the chatbot to respond to  follow-up questions recognize its  mistakes inquire about incorrect  premises and refuse inappropriate  requests  currently chat GPT is running on its  Knight's version this new version is  expected to be more accurate than the  previous one  however there are some significant  drawbacks to factual accuracy and  Reliance on a large data set of texts  for training  anyway artificial intelligence is  shaping the future of humankind across  almost every Enterprise it is already  the leading motorist of arising  Technologies like big data Robotics and  iot  observing the signals from the internet  the future of chat Bots seems quite  promising chat GPT and other language  models will continue to improve with the  ability to understand and respond to  human language became even more natural  and seamless  in the upcoming days chatgpt has the  potential to add new features like voice  command and so on  [Music]
