 hi everyone today I'm going to show you  how to use chat GPT which is a new  chatbot by openai that can really help  you improve your code and learn how to  write code and understand your code or  other pieces of code better get any  examples of sort of code that you need  to write and even generate different  applications  it's pretty cool and it is actually the  only chat bot that I've ever enjoyed so  I'm going to get into a few examples and  explore the power of it and hopefully  this will convince you that it's going  to be a useful tool in the future for  Developers  I'll link the examples in the  description below so you can just click  through to ones that you are interested  in so chat GPT has a very simple  interface it's just a chat bot so just  type in your request I'm going to ask it  to create a method in a class called  calculator that sums the numbers in an  array  I send that request through and I also  specified the language you can specify  many different languages it knows quite  a lot so here I am specifying that I  want C sharp and it's giving me the code  back that will sum the numbers in an  array  is going to also give an example of how  you could use it  often we'll explain little different  pieces of the code if it's doing  something that it thinks is a clever way  to do it and it will explain sort of why  it's doing that so it's quite good to  sort of understand how to improve your  code as well I'm going to ask it to add  some X unit tests for the code most  developers like tests they help them  make sure their code isn't going to  break as easily but often it can be a  bit tedious to add tests so here I am  generating some tests using the chat gbt  chat bot  I'm using the X unit framework which is  quite a popular framework in C sharp  goes ahead and generates an example test  for me  and asserts that it's actually correct  that the value is correct from the code  it also explains that  um what the test does  if you had any further questions about  that code you could actually ask the  chat bot maybe you don't really know  much about what that fact attribute does  or what the square brackets are you  could ask about that but I'm just going  to ask it if it thinks there are any  additional tests that would be useful  and it's going to come back to me and  give me some suggestions on tests that  it would recommend adding so it's  basically going to suggest a few  different edge cases  like an empty array an array with a  single element Ray with negative numbers  a large array  and then also just checking what would  happen if there's a null array if you  want a different thing to happen then  you might want to tell the um  the chat GPT bot that you actually want  that change made and it would make that  change for you I'm just going to get to  add the test as I'm happy with the tests  it's suggested  you could even tell it to add additional  tests if you think it's missed something  so it will go ahead and write all that  code  um I think it'll be really useful in the  future when it's integrated into your  Ides because you're going to be not have  to copy and paste all the code across  and it's actually really quite smart and  does do a lot of things correctly I  don't account to too many issues when  going from my examples and you're going  to see a few but they're all pretty  minor and in general it does help you  there are times when it gets stuck and I  think that's probably as it's just a  free research preview it might get more  server power when it's um  when your access paid versions and I'm  really interested to see what their  pricing model is like  because I'll be interested in using it  it makes  things quite easy it actually does have  some Smart Suggestions with quite good  insights that I thought it wouldn't  really have as a chat bot  I'm also going to just ask me to  ask it to generate me some sequel I want  it to define a many-to-many relationship  for me between students and courses and  I'm going to specify  what columns I want in the table but I'm  not going to tell it a data type I'm  going to sort of Let It infer what it  wants to from my request and hopefully  it will give me data types that I was  interested in if it didn't then I could  go ahead and say for this column could  you please change that to be  a decimal or something like that  so it goes ahead and creates my sequel  It's just going to specify what you're  going to need to have a mini to mini  relationship and give you the actual  sequel for that so it's saying you need  the two tables that other students and  the courses table and then it's going to  give you the sequel for that including  all the data types I'm happy with those  data types that's provided me  um it's also giving you that third table  so that the table is the way that you're  creating the mini to mini relationship  you need basically the foreign key to  Student and courses it explains why you  need that  it'll also give you a bit of example of  how to insert data  and if you needed an example of how to  insert data into the student or courses  table you could also ask it to do that  and it will give you some examples  it does tend to get say that of course  there's multiple ways you can do things  I mean there's development and there are  always many different ways you can sort  of approach a problem so it is quite  good I think in that sense that it's  saying this isn't the only way to do  things but this is how I'm going to do  it and a lot of the time it does seem to  get things quite right  next up I'm going to ask it to write me  a method in C sharp that reverses an  array  so I'm just going to go and create a new  array and copy the values from the first  array into that reversed array that's  actually not the most efficient method  and I am aware of that  so I might go ahead and ask it to create  me a more efficient implementation  it just it does say that this is only an  example and that there are other ways to  do it  so I'm just going to go ahead and ask it  to make this more efficient  it's going to explain a few different  ways that it could make it more  efficient  so there are three different  implementations that suggested including  paralyzing the um  array reversal  that's showing me how to use that  Library function there  I'm going to ask me how ask it how to  show me how to do it in place  which is using the same array basically  which would be swapping the elements  sometimes you do need to be quite  specific so you can see that it's  actually going to show me how to use  that array.reverse method that had  previously shown me I actually wanted to  see how I might code up the In-Place  implementation myself  um this sort of thing could actually be  quite useful for when you're studying  for interviews because you can sort of  see different ways of doing things  and be able to learn from how it's  suggesting it and  what improvements could be made  so it could help you do better in  interviews if you use this as a sort of  study tool  so I'm asking it to do it without using  the array.reverse method as I found that  um I wasn't specific enough with my last  question  so here it's going to give me the  example how how to do it in place but  without the array.reverse method  so you can see that's going through half  the elements and I could ask it why it's  going through  um half of it if I wasn't sure  I can ask any sort of questions and I'll  sort of explain that logic there  I may also want to make this generic  because I might not have a list of  numbers I may have a list of strings for  example so I can ask it to make it  generic and it'll do that conversion for  me  so you can see it's using that um T to  indicate that it's generic and it's got  those little triangle braces  and here it is giving an example of me  reversing the array using strings  you can see the above example actually  had in the method the array was still  called numbers and I wanted it to be  more generic so I may actually want to  choose to rename that array and I can  actually ask  the open AI chat bot to do that for me  so I'm going to ask it to rename the  numbers parameter to elements  they'll give me the example code with  everything fixed up and renamed  I think this will be really useful in  the future for tidying up code  um once it's integrated in Ides and once  it's a little bit faster I found that  sometimes this sort of lagged a bit and  stopped on bigger code I imagine it  would be even more problematic  so now I'm going to provide a piece of  code that I want it to refactor and I'm  going to get them to refactor the  properties in the code to be Pascal case  I'm just going to give it some random  casing and see how it goes with that  so I'm going to add some properties I'm  going to add a first name and last name  for person so first underscore name and  I'm going to want that to be refactored  to Pascal case  I'm also going to provide a last name  um property  I'm going to make that all lowercase and  see if it picks up that name should be  uppercase as well  and then I'm also going to create a  method for it I'm going to make this  method lowercase just to see how it  handles that because that's not the  typical convention for C sharp typically  methods in C sharp would also be Pascal  case  I'm just going to do a console right  line in here  for the first and last name to make sure  that it's picking up  um  that it should be changing the first and  last name inside that get info method  so now I've got my code I've provided it  to it and it's going to go ahead and  provide the reflected version for me so  you can see it's converted first name  and last name to the correct Pascal  casing and it's also converted get info  so it's saying that the properties have  been updated based on my request  and it's also  saying that get info has been updated to  follow the convention so it knows that  this is a convention that is common in C  sharp and applies to that convention  even though I didn't ask it to  I might want to add a backing field for  a property so I'm going to ask it to do  that for me now  and I may want to make the setup private  so I could also request that  the open AI chatbot is going to go ahead  and make those changes for me  so you can see it's added that backing  field that's a private string underscore  last name as is the c-sharp conventions  and it's made that Setter private  explains a little bit of what the code  is doing here  once again if you don't really  understand any of the code it will go  ahead and explain it you can actually  copy and code and it'll explain that for  you  I want to test that it sort of knows  design patterns a little bit so I'm  going to ask it to make the following  classes Singleton so I'm just creating a  class called my Singleton  what I'm going to add to this is just a  simple method and also I'm going to add  a public Constructor which you wouldn't  get in a Singleton so first off I'm just  going to add my method which is just  going to console right line doing  something I'm just adding that because  that's what I'm going to need to call on  my instance  a Singleton if you don't know what a  Singleton is basically is where you can  only create one instance of the class so  it's a class that you can only create  one object of  so you wouldn't have a public  Constructor for a Singleton because you  want to be able to restrict people from  creating them  so I'm going to get the open IA AI chat  bot to go ahead and fix that up and  convert it to a Singleton  inside my  um  Constructor I'm just going to console  right line that I'm creating the  Singleton instance  it's going to go ahead and modify my  code to make it a Singleton you can see  that it creates an  private static  field for instance which is basically my  instance and it'll only instantiate that  it's null otherwise it'll just return  the instance and also it's made my  Constructor private  explains why it's done these changes  so that if you weren't sure of what was  required to make something a Singleton  in the future you'd be able to do it or  you'd be able to understand the code  that they have created  now this isn't actually thread safe if  two fridge tried to access that  Singleton instance at the same time  there would be some issues they could  both create the new instance  I'm going to ask it to convert the get  instance method to a property that's  quite a common way of implementing a  Singleton and c-sharp is that you'd use  a property instead of a get method  that's just because it's a bit more  um standard there  and other languages you can do things  differently but this is just more common  in C sharp  so you can see inside that git for the  property it's  added that code from the get instance  method that it had previously  it explains what it's done to make the  changes  and it also gives you an example of how  to use it and access that Singleton  instance  now as I mentioned this isn't actually  food safe so I'm going to ask it to make  this fridge safe  saying please because it's kind to be  kind to your chat by AI  so it's going to show me how to add a  lock and that lock is basically going to  stop  um different friends from accessing my  single instance if another Fred has it  currently  but you can see that lock is around my  entire git and they actually can mean  that only one thread can access the  instance field at a time I might just  want to prevent  um  threads from creating the instance  multiple times so I can ask it to make  those changes and I'm going to do that  in a moment  so I'm asking it to only lock on  creating the the um my Singleton  instance  so it's going to go ahead and make those  changes for me  and these are changes I'm happy with  pretty impressed with how the um open  eye AI chat GPT  handles things and understands code  quite well I really didn't think it'd be  at this level I thought there'd be quite  a lot of laws you can see there that  sort of cut out part way through  outputting my  um  code of how to access the  Singleton instance but that's all right  sometimes you don't need that final part  and you can actually ask it to continue  or try again if you did need that  I'm going to ask it a question about how  if it can find me an API to get the  current weather  and that would be useful if you're just  looking for ways to get certain things  um it knows a lot about what other code  has done and it can find you examples of  um how to do certain things in different  languages and just make your life quite  easy  it's going to be really useful I think  in the future to help reduce the need  for documentation of code because it's  going to be able to help you sort of  generate examples without that are  relevant to your context without having  to  um  read so much code on like different  documentation websites and adjust it to  your situation it'll adjust it for you  to your situation  so basically what it's done is it's  found an API endpoint that I requested  and it's given me an example of how I'd  go about  calling that API endpoint and what I  would do with the response  tells me a bit about the different  packages that it could be using  um so if I wanted to change anything  there I could and I'm just going to  accept that that's quite good  and yeah it does say that there are  other ways to write this code but I've  found that it's generally gives quite  reasonable code and that's a good  starting point  I'm going to ask if I could get that  example in a different language and it's  go going to go ahead and give me that  example in the other language  so it could be quite good if you find  something that does what you want in one  language and you want to convert it into  another language in the future so that  you can do that so maybe you're  switching your code system from one  language to another just because maybe  you started in  node.js and you are finding that you  would rather have some of the like  um  a more like  object-oriented language like  um maybe you want to use C sharp and  just have a bit more structure  so yeah you can go find code examples in  another language and you can get them to  get it converted into your language and  it'll just speed you up your development  process because you're not going to need  to do that conversion yourself that's  probably a bit safer as people are quite  prone to making mistakes and missing  things I'm not saying it's going to be  perfect all of the time it does warn you  that it doesn't necessarily have  accuracy so it is important that you've  got tests in place to make sure that  things are as you would expect  I'm going to ask if if I need to install  the request module because it said that  I'm going to need to use the request  module to make those HTTP requests in  Python it's going to give me a bit of an  explanation about how I will need to  install the request module and some  examples of how I could go about  installing those and some  um managers that I could use to package  managers that I could use to do those  installs  you can also ask it to give you rejects  expressions for a specific thing so I'm  going to ask it to give me the rejects  to validate an email address so I find  that I'm often not the best with free  gxn so I'll go to one of those Rejects  and pattern matching sites and just sort  of fiddle around with my rejects until I  get it correct but this is going to give  you  what you need and you could probably ask  it to make some modifications if you  wanted to and it will give you what  limitations the rejects has and a little  bit of reason why it's given you that  specific Rejects  if you wanted to you could copy and  paste this into a one of those reject  sites and just test it meets your needs  so I'm going to ask at a more general  question that's sort of more opinion  based I've asked it whether I should use  lateral react native  it does say that depends on your  specific requirements and preferences  it'll explain a bit about each platform  and give some benefits of each platform  um I think this is pretty valid it's  basically saying that it depends a bit  on what your requirements are and your  language preferences because  um  flutter uses Dart which is not that  common for developers to know about  react native uses JavaScript which a lot  of developers know talks about the  performance the communities and the  different features available for both  um and basically says they're both good  platforms it just depends on which one  you would suit your needs better so it's  best to try both and evaluate what would  be better for you  I'd say that's pre-balanced advice and  generally stands true there's not really  there's a reason why both communities  are large  now I'm going to provide a piece of code  that won't compile and ask it to fix it  I'm going to put quite a lot of mistakes  in here so I'm actually testing that  does quite well with um finding issues  it's not just one issue there's quite a  few different issues in this code  so basically I've missed my class  modifier when defining my class I'm  going to miss the return type when  defining my method  I'm going to call My Method right to  console I'm going to pass a parameter in  but I'm not going to specify the type of  the parameter that parameter is going to  be a string but I'm not going to tell  the  um I'm not going to tell the  um open AI bot what that parameter type  is and then going to console.writeline  that parameter  and I'm going to miss off my semicolon  and then I'm going to add an extra curly  brace  so yes it says the C sharp code you  provided won't compile because it  contains several syntax errors and that  goes ahead and fixes my code it also  tells me what changes it's made and  explains the changes so basically you  can learn from your mistakes a bit more  easily as you don't need to figure out  what's going wrong as much on your own  so I feel like this is a really useful  tool to help you learn different  languages as if you've got some mistakes  it's going to help you identify them  so now I'm going to show you how to get  it to convert one piece of code to  another so I'm just copying a very  simple piece of code here which is that  right to console method and I'm going to  ask it to convert fit the code to  JavaScript which is a common programming  language  so it's going to show me how to do this  it's going to give me a function that  console logs the perimeter  and that's basically doing the same  thing as console.writeline I don't need  to define the type as this is Javascript  I'm also going to ask it to give me the  Google Google oauth endpoints  um this is quite useful because you  don't need to go off and search for them  um when you Google them you can find  them but it's not necessarily the first  thing that pops up  um so it's going to give you the  different endpoints and you can actually  ask if if they can give you an example  of how that you go about using these  um and I'm going to do that in a moment  it also talks a bit about how you would  go about using those endpoints so it  says you need to obtain a client ID and  secret and then use these credentials to  send requests the endpoints which you  can then use to authenticate and  authorize users with their Google  account  let's see it does to add the disclaimer  that this is just the main endpoint so  if you want further ones you can  actually request them like if you want  the one to revoke a token  which is what you'd do if the user were  to log out  so now I'm going to give an example  implementation of the pkce flow using  the above endpoints  so it's going to tell me a bit about  um what request you're going to need to  make and what the parameters are going  to be it's going to give me the API  um in point addresses and what sort of  parameters I need to pass to it it'll  also describe each of these parameters  so it's quite clear to you what they  mean and which ones you're going to need  to change  so I've asked for a very specific flow  the pkco or flow if you're interested in  knowing a bit more about oauth you can  look into that  but basically this will allow you to  do things very quickly  um without having to know a whole heap  of stuff it's going to give you some  good guidance and some good easy to  follow explanations of what different  things are  um without having to have a whole heap  of background knowledge and you're going  to be able to implement things a lot  faster that way  once again I think it's a really good  learning tool because if you have any  questions or anything you're unsure  about you can follow that up with the  open AI chat button  my husband's actually recently started  developing and he's really excited about  this because he um  he doesn't have like a large technical  background he only started a few months  ago and he's already in his first job  um he did think that initially the  chatbot didn't have enough  um information on the framework he's  using but you actually just have to  sometimes get more targeted questions  and then it will be able to answer your  questions  so I'm going to ask it to tidy up the  following code for me and remove the  duplicate code  I'm just going to create a very simple  method that's just going to be a C sharp  method here  I don't need to specify the C sharp it's  actually going to pick up the C sharp  based on  um that I'm using  console.writeline which is um  a C sharp way of  um  outputting to the console I'm also  asking it to put it inside a class  because currently it's just a method  outside of a class  my method's basically going to sum  numbers and then console right line them  and I've asked it to remove the  duplicate code  I'm going to do this twice so that it  can find the duplicate code to remove  this is actually quite a simple example  but it's going to be quite good because  it's going to actually explain to you  why it doesn't refactor things in a  certain way  so it goes ahead and rewrites my code  and you can see it's created a method  called add numbers  and then it's just still got their  duplicate console right lines as you may  wonder why it doesn't actually  and the console.writeline to the ad  numbers and it's going to I'm going to  get that to explain that in a second and  I actually completely agree with why it  does that  um but yeah it's extracted that addition  logic into the ad numbers method  you can see it's given a reasonable name  for what it actually is doing too so  it's actually quite smart in that aspect  I didn't tell it what to name that  method it looked at what the code was  doing and gave it a name  so now I'm going to ask it to refactor  the console.writelines to  and so it's going to go ahead and do  that it's actually creating a separate  method there to put the console right  line code in  and you may wonder why it doesn't just  put it inside the ad numbers  it also tells you why it's using the  private access modifier  and that's just because it's used  internally within my class  that tells you why you might um  put it into its own method  um and it's basically saying that so  that you can do it separately without  modifying the the initial method  um it makes things a bit more like  testable  so now I'm asking why it didn't put the  console right line and Edition in the  same method  and it's going to interpret my question  as I intended and tell me why I didn't  do that  so saying that wants to separate the two  concerns because they're not related  adding and console right lines are not  sort of related and you're it's kind of  following the solid principles that you  want sort of a single responsibility  um you don't want to be modifying  you don't want too much going on in one  place that's not related you sort of  want to keep those separate so that you  can test the code separately and more  easily  so you may have noticed that the ad  numbers method was private so I want to  ask it now  how I go about testing the private  method that's kind of like a common  thing that is kind of an issue when  you're wanting to write unit tests  you've got this small modular thing  that's really easy to unit test but it's  actually private because it's only used  within that class so I'm going to go  ahead and ask that  as saying that um you can use this  internals visible attribute to make the  method accessible to your test assembly  I'm not 100 sure this is correct I'm  pretty sure that it's only  private protected ones that or internal  um  methods that would be accessible if you  use that internals visible to attribute  so I'm not 100 sure this is actually  correct  um but that's what it is saying  so I'd you'd want to be actually testing  this  um you might find that this is not  actually correct it does have a  disclaimer that not everything is  correct it'll be pretty hard for it to  get everything right so  you do have to be aware that sometimes  it's going to get things wrong but it  really does guide you  um in a good direction a lot of the time  so yeah I checked whether it's short  that internal visible to allows access  to private methods it does say that but  then it also talks about  and the internal access modifier  so yeah I'm not 100 sure that is not a  little bit confused there  um but yeah test it if you want to  this may have changed since I  um last wrote a unit test for a private  method  I'm pretty sure that private protected  is the better approach there but  you can ask it a bit about  um more General topics like what sort of  architecture templates might be good for  C sharp and it'll come back to you with  some common ones that are used and a bit  of description about them  um so it's going to give me that model  view controller as a design pattern that  would be quite commonly used  um it will give me about model view view  model  and I'll explain a bit about  the benefits of these different  um  architectures and why you might use them  it's also going to talk about  microservices which is a pretty popular  architecture  it does say you should use the one  that's best fit for your project and  obviously it's going to depend a lot so  there's still room for personal input  and I think that's where that Gap is at  the moment for AI like you it's not at  that stage where it's going to take over  our jobs there's still quite a little  Gap but it is a gap that is narrowing  um and it's best to work with it for now  because it can really improve your  efficiency you could see it kind of cut  out  um a bit part way through that question  so I asked it to try again I'm going to  skip over a bit of this trying again  because  it's a bit repetitive and can take a  little while  um yeah so I've found like I said that  because it's a free preview sometimes it  does cut out I'm sure that would be  fixed in a paid version with more  dedicated server resources I think there  are a lot of people trying it out at the  moment because it's quite new and  exciting  um but yeah sometimes it'll give you a  different response the next time so you  can actually ask questions multiple  times if you aren't sure that the answer  fits exactly what you want but you feel  like you're asking the right question  so I might be someone who learns better  from actual examples of code so I might  ask it to provide me an example of what  the microservices  code might look like I can ask it for  different templates if I wanted a  specific template I've asked it for the  clean code architecture for example  before so it's going to go ahead and  provide me a bit of an example here  it usually provides you a pretty simple  example and then you can go ahead and  you can you can go ahead and request  changes and it'll go make those changes  for you  um and from there you can sort of adapt  things to a bit more  um catered to your personal situation if  you aren't the best at writing code and  you can sort of see how it would go  about doing things  so you can see it's calling lots of  different  um  endpoints basically that are going to  get the data and that's because  different microservices have very  granular responsibilities I think these  are probably even more granular than you  would typically have you've just got a  very granular one that's responsible for  user ID one that's responsible for user  info one that's responsible for name and  one that's responsible for address you  can see that it cut out there but I'm  not too worried about that because I am  not actually going to use that code I'm  just showing you guys as an example if I  were really desperate to use that code I  could click try again so it would  regenerate me that code  but I know that sometimes you can risk  microservices architecture getting into  bad States because maybe part of the  system's down and you haven't  handled that sort of situation  appropriately it's kind of really  important to think about in a design and  advanced resiliency into your  microservice architecture so I'm asking  open eye AI chat bot a bit about how I  can handle that  so you can see sometimes it doesn't  count to your ear and if that's the case  it's okay you just click try again  so I'll tell you a few ways that you can  reduce the risk that your microservice  architecture is going to end up in a bad  state it talks about how you can use an  API Gateway to um prove the security  and reduce the risk that you're going to  run out of resources it talks about  monitoring and logging your  microservices so you can shut things  down before they  [Music]  um  hit a bad State and it also talks a bit  about how you can use circuit breakers  and retries and also  how to use rolling deployments and blue  green deployments so that you can easily  roll back to your previous state if  something does go wrong so I'm a bit  interested in circuit breakers and  retries so I'm going to ask me to ask it  to give me an example of how I would  Implement that  it knows the context of what your  conversation has been so it's actually  going to it would even if I didn't  specify those in C sharp it would  provide that previous example  and add the circuit breaking and retries  for that  um so yeah it's going to go ahead and  pick up a common c-sharp nuget package  for that sort of thing and use that  so that common nougat package I  mentioned is poly basically it's allows  you to easily retry and specify when you  want to stop retrying  when there's an issue with your requests  on microservices  as quite  um powerful and there are lots of  different ways you can configure it  um just if you were interested you could  just check the documentation you could  try and specify using a open AI  different situation like different  times you want to retry and different  times you want to break out of trying  but yeah let's edit it in here and  showing how you would use that with  actually calling the different  microservices that you have  you can see that they are microservices  and they're all running on different  endpoints  um so they've all got sorry different  servers so they've like got different  ports that you can access them on  um so showing that they're basically  different applications  you can see it cut out there once again  so it is quite common that it cuts out  and yeah sometimes you're just going to  need to tell it to retry so that you can  get past that  I'm going to get it to create me a  c-sharp API now that allows me to  download a PDF with Hello World text in  it  um so that's  like not a  specific like not a super complex task  but it's going to require it to sort of  know about  um different libraries that would help  with creating a PDF and it's going to  need to know a bit about how C sharp  apis work so it's going to give me an  example  I'm actually going to show you this  actually running because it's a little  bit more complex  um so yeah it gives me the namespace of  my app if I wanted to change that to  match whatever my actual namespace was I  could do that and it gives me a class I  could change that ask it to change it if  I wanted to as well  and it writes me the code that will  generate a PDF that I can then go ahead  and download  tells you a bit about how the code works  and what's happening in the code so that  you can understand it and make any  changes if you felt like open AI chat  GPT wasn't up to what you needed  um but yeah I'm quite happy with that  um I might want to ask it how I'd send a  get request to the endpoint maybe I have  someone who wants to make a call to that  endpoint to actually get the data  um and I want to be able to just  generate maybe some documentation on how  to do it  so yeah this could also be useful for  generating documentation in the future  although I think that there would be  less necessary  as this gains more and more knowledge  and power of how to do development  so you can see it makes that request and  then writes that file to  um  your local system  it also tells you how you can run it  using the  dot net CLI if you're planning on using  that I'm just using visual studio and  I'm going to actually go ahead and show  you this in visual studio now  so I've got visual studio and I'm going  to create a new app  I'm going to choose API as I'm going to  create a new API and I'm going to use  controllers I'm not going to uncheck to  use minimal apis I just want to keep  with the normal controllers that are  reasonably used to you can use minimal  apis if you want  if I go ahead and open my app which I've  given that name just so that my  namespace would match up and I wouldn't  need to change it I could just copy and  paste my controller directly in  you can see if I go look at my weather  forecast controller it actually  extends controller base and it has a few  different attributes against it which  our  um current API that we've generated with  open AI chat GPT hasn't got  so if I go back to my chat bot then I  can go and ask it to make these changes  so I'm asking it to convert my PDF  controller  into a web API controller  which is basically what those  um the other controls of the weather  forecast controller is  and so open AI chatbot's going to think  about that for a moment and then go make  my changes for me  so you can see that it's added those  different attributes and it's also  extending controller base now the code  largely Remains the Same  it also explains a little bit about what  the changes are  you can see it cut out there but I'm not  too interested in the explanation I'm  just wanting the code  um I've reasonably I can understand C  sharp code reasonably well as I work  with it day to day  sorry if you can hear the rain in the  background it's just raining here so I'm  going to add a new class  I'm going to name that PDF controller  I'm just going to copy and paste my code  from the open AI gbt chat bot  you can see that I've got a few errors  and it's just this nuget package has not  been imported  I'm gonna go ahead and add that so I go  to my dependencies and I'm going to go  to nougat and manage nuget packages  I'm sure once open AI chat bot is  integrated with the now Ides at some  point which I'm sure would be a step  that would be important for it to be  really useful this would be possible  from within it but for now you're going  to have to go and resolve those sorts of  inputs yourself  so you do still sort of need to  understand a bit of what's going on you  can't just write code without having any  understanding  I'm going to go ahead and build and you  can see there's a build error so let's  go ahead and fix that up  so you can see that it's giving me this  error on this line here and I can just  use the ID to fix that  um so it's basically  um conflicting references that wasn't  sure what to use so some things do need  to be resolved from within  so I'm just going to go ahead and run  this and when it runs what it's going to  do is it's just going to open up the  Swagger which includes my API endpoint  for downloading the PDF if I go to that  URL which is just the same as  my Swagger in point but  um  with the end of um slash API slash PDF  slash hello hyphen world  it's going to go ahead and prompt me to  allow the download of the PDF which I've  accepted and when it downloads it's  going to open that PDF and you can see  that PDF displays hello world  successfully and that is what I had  requested from the chat GPT chat Bots  I'm really impressed with that  I'm going to ask it now to help me  create a tic-tac-toe game in react  native  so you're going to see that I'm actually  not I'm going to cut out some of this  part here because it actually is going  to get stuck quite a few times creating  this because it's a bit more complex  code it's not  a short code and it's reasonably short  but it's not super short  um well it's starting to create I'm  going to just create my actual  Expo react native app because I actually  am going to want to demo it working to  you and show a few problems that came  about but they're all minor problems and  for the most part it generates most of  the code for you so it's pretty cool  so it goes ahead and it generates the  code for you  um if you try again it will actually  generate different code and sometimes  may generate different requirements like  sometimes it might handle having a  winner and sometimes it might  just endlessly allow you to play without  handling a winner so  in that way it sort of doesn't always  give you the same response and that's  why it can be worth trying again if you  don't get exactly what you want  or asking it to refine if it does give  you enough stuff I'm going to change  into my  tic-tac-toe directory and start up that  app  just while it goes ahead and generates  that code  and I'm going to open that app on iOS  and it's going to load up at the moment  I actually don't have any tic-tac-toe  code in there and I'm generating it at  present  it gets stuck quite a few times failing  to generate because I think the servers  are quite busy so I'm going to skip to a  point where I actually managed to get it  to successfully generate  as you've used these tools a bit more  you're actually going to gain some  efficiency in how you actually learn to  use them so you're going to see that  this actually cuts out once again  generating my react native application  code but I can actually just ask it to  continue from the above code  um so it doesn't actually need to start  again and that will stop it from failing  Midway through when I ask it to try  again it has to regenerate and it's  often regenerating a completely new  set of code um when I ask it to continue  it even if it gets stuck a little bit  further on at least it's going to have  most of the code already there and I'm  going to eventually get my complete  piece of code whereas before I was  Finding  that I spent quite a while trying to  generate it but it just never was sort  of coming  um  to an end because it kept failing  towards some point of the application  so I was going to basically check  whether there's  um is going to basically render the  board and allow you to press on the  board and put naughts and crosses on the  board  depending on who is playing currently  it's going to handle all that logic for  me so that's quite  um cool I don't need to do any code it  just sort of generates this for me  um but I am going to need to piece the  together the code in this example  because I've asked it to continue on  because it did fail part way through it  explains a bit about how the code works  as well  so explains a bit about the logic of the  code  um  and how it works  and what functionality it provides it  often will say if it's limited in  certain functionality as well so I'm  going to copy that code across into my  application  and I've opened Visual Studio code so I  can copy that in and I've got my  simulator open so you can see the  changes  so I'm just going to paste in that whole  code and you can see that it's not  complete so I'm going to need to go get  that second part of the code from the  chat GPT chat button  so I'm going to copy that code too  and I'm going to fix up this render  board function which is incomplete and  that's where my code is cut off  so now I'm going to save that and it's  going to show my tic-tac-toe game  but if I'm clicking on screen I'm  noticing it's not actually making those  changes  I do understand the code so I can read  it a bit and I can see there's a handle  cell press on The View  um that's the on press property of that  view there  um so it should be calling that handle  sale press  you might want to add some console  logging to sort of see if that's  actually been called and maybe something  else is going wrong  um so yeah there is some troubleshooting  that you may encounter but as prequel  how it generates a love code for you  um and mostly just works  so if it's pressed I'm just going to  console log pressed I just want  something simple to tell me that's  actually being pressed so I can see that  isn't actually being triggered  um so I'm going to just investigate and  find out why  um it's clearly something that  open AI chat GPT isn't handling very  well and so isn't aware of an issue  there  a quick Google told me that basically  the view doesn't have an on-press  property and that you might want to use  touchable opacity I know there's  actually a pressable component now but I  am just going to use touchable opacity  for Simplicity but I'm going to see if  open AI knows why it's not working so  I'm just going to say pressing on Cell  isn't working do you know why  um so I've asked it and it's saying that  basically the view component does not  have an on press prop and that the  handle press handle cell press function  will not be called when the user Taps on  the game cell  it's saying that you can add that on  press prop to The View and it will um  allow the handle cell press function to  be called when the user Taps on the game  cell but it just gives me that exact  same code basically that I had  previously  um  and so I think that it's not  quite realizing that it can't actually  give an on-press to the view it's just  not going to work so  we'll go ahead and fix that  so you can see that render sale does  already have that handle sale press  function so I'm just going to go ahead  and change that view to be a touchable  opacity  to do that I'm going to need to import  touchable opacity  and if I go ahead and save those changes  that should work  so now I can click on my tic-tac-toe  game okay you can see it hasn't quite  taken into account the fact that I  actually have my font size increased for  accessibility and just to show you guys  the app more clearly so I'm going to  need to manually adjust that font size  and now you can see those tic-tac-toe  knots and Crosses appear more clearly  if I have a success it's not going to  tell me that I'm successful and it's  going to allow me to continue playing  and you can see I can override different  um  boxes or cells so I'm going to ask open  AI to make those changes for me to allow  me to have a winner  so I'm going to ask it to add the  ability to basically check for a winner  and stop the game at that point  and it's going to go ahead and give me  that code  so it explains how you can identify when  the winner is found and then it's um  saying how it's going to approach it and  um what it's going to add to your code  it's basically generating the same code  but it's going to add additional things  like whether the game is over  I was going to add those checks for  whether the game is over  um before it handles that sale press  um if the game is over it's not going to  want to do anything with the celebrate  sale press  it's also going to  um check whether there's a win  and if there is it's going to sit that  the game is over  I'm going to skip ahead because it did  start to cut out again so I'm just going  to  skip to when the code is actually  successful  from the open AI chatbot it does get  stuck a few times so when it gets stuck  at this point I'm going to actually  specify when I want it to continue from  because sometimes it'll continue with a  bit of a gap and I think that's just  when open AI chat GPT actually is  further ahead in what it is processed  than what it is output to the person  so I've asked it to continue from that  handle reset button press function  definition  so that I know exactly what code to put  in and I'm not putting an incorrect code  or incomplete code  so I'll continue on from that point  onwards  so we're almost at the end of the code  but you can see that didn't quite  complete the style so I'm just going to  ask it from to continue from the Styles  constant definition onwards it's really  cool how you can specify where you want  it to continue onwards just to make sure  that you know exactly where it is in the  code it'll make your combining of the  code easier although obviously it would  ideally just complete  it is powerful enough to sort of fix  itself and resolve from sort of values  and I'm sure it will get more stable in  the future  um as this is just the initial release  and it's still  um reasonably new and I'm really  impressed with the power behind it and  how um  strong as general thoughts are on things  and even just like the design of  software it's not giving you really  poorly written software it gives you  reasonable quality software so that's  not so bad I didn't actually ask it to  update that touchable opacity side of  things I'm going to need to go ahead and  update that again  um afterwards as I am  change that without telling it to change  it if I'd asked it to change it then it  would have included that change in  future revisions and made those made and  I wouldn't have had to go back and make  manual changes  so I'm just going to copy that Styles  and that's going to be the end of my  code and I can go back and update that  touchable opacity  um cell basically so that I can do my  handle my on press  oh yeah and I forgot to say I also asked  it to add a reset button so that it can  reset the board  um and I can play the game again because  you're not just going to want to play  the game once and then have a useless  app that you're going to have to exit  out of you're going to want to be able  to get back to a state where you can  enjoy it again  so after I save it it's got this new  Grid it's actually changed my UI a  little bit but that's fine probably to  handle that reset button and if I go  ahead and play my game and win it'll  tell me that I won and it won't let me  press on anything else because the game  is over so it's saying the game is  complete you cannot keep playing now if  I go ahead and have a draw it's going to  tell me that there's a drawer and once  again my reset option will be available  to me  so you can tell see that's told me that  there's a draw because no one has won no  one has three in a row and that's a draw  so you can see how you can actually use  it to build a reasonably like an app  with a reasonable amount of logic I'm  pretty sure that if I  um spent more time I could build a more  complex app and I probably will do a  demo of how to do that some stage as I  know a lot of people are learning to  code and that's why they're  finding us on YouTube to sort of learn a  bit more from  um so I think that this would Aid um  those people who have some code but  aren't quite sure what different parts  are doing you can copy and paste that  code  into the chat GPT open AI chat bot and  actually  see why it's doing what it's doing  because it will explain it well and if  you don't understand a particular part  of the explanation you can ask more  questions and I'll be able to respond to  you about  um  why something is done a certain way or  what it means  so now I'm going to ask it to create me  a component so I could just get it to  create me any number of components  really and it's just going to speed up  my app development because I'm not going  to need to do all the like scaffolding  it's not going to create the most pretty  components so you're probably going to  want to go ahead and style that  um but you can see it's creating me a  profile  component here with the image name  age  occupation and birthday and it's going  to give me some styling for those as  well  I like how it's giving me  um different style for each sort of  text that I have even though they're  mostly the same because it means that if  I did want to control that styling a bit  more fine-grained I'm not going to have  to do a whole heap of refactoring to the  code to change it it's going to be  mostly there and I can just edit the  ones I want to edit  so I'm going to create a new folder for  my component  I'm just going to use my tuk-tac-toe  game because it's already open just for  Simplicity  but obviously this is not part of the  tic-tac-toe game  so I'm going to create my user profile  screen and copying my coding I realize I  forgot to name it as a JavaScript file  so I'm just going to rename it now  and that's basically a component that I  can use and import from my app.js so I'm  going to go ahead and clear this code  out and use that new component that I've  created well did the open AI chat gbt  bot has created  so I'm going to go ahead and import my  user profile screen and I'm not going to  need that those imports from react  native as I'm going to use my user  profile screen but first I'm going to  just display that for you  so I'm just going to add that user  profiles screen and return that from the  app and you can see I've got a little  image that's in a nice Circle  um it's got a name and it's got an age  occupation and birthday  so I can ask it to make some changes  um so I might want to make the  um  profile picture have a shadow and I  won't want to make the name bold  and I also might want to make it so so I  could do style changes  and I could also do  um passing the info as properties  because like typically you're going to  want components they're reusable  um  and reusable components are great just  you can use them for like with many  different users like you're not going to  want  Jane Doe or John Doe all the time you  might want John Smith  or you whoever your users are you're not  going to want to hard code those values  then you want to pass them as property  so I've asked it to make those changes  let's go ahead going ahead and making  those changes so that I can pass in the  name age occupation birthday and profile  pic URI  so first I'm just going to add those  properties to my app.js so like I said  you do actually need to have a bit of  understanding on how things are working  because I need to  um sort of specify my properties I'm  just going to copy those  from my  um  my existing user profile screen  because I was quite happy with the data  they provided me  but I might give like for example I  can't be bothered finding a profile  picture image  I can pass my own agent he looked kind  of like quite young so we'll give him  age 22. we'll give him a name  just my name occupation  we'll make him an AI expert and we can  give him a birthday as well  I'm just going to say that this today  I'm going to go ahead now and get that  code that passes in the  values as property so that I can see my  new properties  based on what I've passed in so he was  John Doe age 32 occupation software  engineer but now he is my name age 22 AI  expert with his birthday today and I've  passed it in from the app.js instead of  having it hard coded  so like I said I can also ask it to make  some stylistic changes so I'm just going  to ask it to add a shadow to the profile  pic  some of these things don't necessarily  always work and I'm not going to spend  too much time investigating them  um  but I think just giving additional  commands and it'll be able to give you  better outputs  I'm also going to make the name bold  that goes ahead and generates my code I  think it's a bit quicker this time  because it's quite a simple request and  a lot of the code has already been  generated it's just making some  adjustments it seems when it's  generating code from scratch that it can  be a little bit slower  but I mean that's kind of understandable  I'd be interested in pushing these  capabilities a bit further in the future  with like maybe a more complex game and  maybe some more packages I wanted to use  um  and yeah I'm really excited to explore  how this can help me be a bit more  efficient with my code  um and maybe even generate some code  that I use in tutorials  so I'm going to copy that code with that  new styling  I'm gonna paste it on then  I'm noticing that the name is Bob I'm  not really noticing that the  um Shadow was as bad  um as bold but that's okay  I'm wanting to test a bit further how  far it can go in terms of design so I'm  going to ask it if it could convert that  design into a more material design style  and just sort of see what it gives me  back  so it says here's a updated user profile  using that material design style I can  see that's using a react native paper  package and so that's going to obviously  have some sort of material design  styling I'm interested to see what it  looks like when I get into the  application  so it's using some chips it's using card  and it's using Avatar  that's still keeping like the properties  that I've passed in and everything else  I've sort of specified so it's quite  good  and now that's complete I'm going to  copy and paste it into my application I  suspect this is going to happen issue in  there I don't have that react native  paper package installed but I'm going to  copy it anyway it hasn't told me to  install it which I think would be an  improvement if it's getting me to use a  package I would like it to tell me that  it's actually  needs to be imported by me for anyone  that has quite a bit of experience with  development you would probably  understand that quite quickly it also  recognize that you're a message so it's  not a big deal  so I'm just going to go ahead and add  that react native paper package  it's going to go ahead and install that  and once that's done I can go ahead and  start my application again  what's happening on iOS  and it's giving me another area that is  unable to resolve module react native  safe area context so I'm obviously going  to need to go ahead and install that as  well  um because that is necessary for the  react native paper  package but yeah I I didn't realize  because I'm just doing an install  directly from what I've sort of getting  as errors here  um if I copy and paste this error into  um the open AI chat bot it would  actually probably give me what to do  it's actually I've seen it work quite  well in that sort of context  so I've gone and installed that package  and now I can start my application again  and I'm interested to see what it will  look like obviously it's not going to be  an expected design at this stage it's  quite a human-centric thing to sort of  be able to Envision what's going to look  good I can see it's sort of part way of  the screen but it is a nice card and is  sort of following material design  yeah so I've really enjoyed exploring  the open AI chat gbt with you today  um if you've enjoyed this please let me  know and like And subscribe for more  content I will be creating some  applications using this in the future I  may even go live with it so we can sort  of work through something together  and just let me know in the comments  what sort of things you'd be interested  in creating using chat GPT and what sort  of things you think it would be useful  for and what sort of gaps you think  there are I'm really interested in  hearing people's thoughts on this  exciting new tool for us
