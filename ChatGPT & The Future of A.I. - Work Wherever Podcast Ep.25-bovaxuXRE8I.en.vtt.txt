 foreign  [Music]  [Music]  now  [Music]  but  [Music]  [Music]  hey everybody welcome on into the work  wherever podcast I'm your host Roy  Edwards and this is the podcast where we  talk about tech tech trends  remote work AI Automation and the  ability to work wherever so you can live  every day like in a Saturday and I got  sitting here hi guys that's how you know  it's going to be a good episode  so  there's this new release of technology  that has come out in the last couple  months it's called chat GPT which is an  accessible AI That's open to the public  and that's the topic of discussion today  where  there's a lot of positive negative all  kinds of different  reactions to people now  when I sent you this you hadn't heard of  I've never I had seen a little bit about  it but like I had no clue like why you  hadn't actually physically played with  it or right exactly typed through or  that like anybody could just do it right  which is the biggest deal out of this so  chat GPT  is a uh it's an AI chatbot essentially  is what it is and so it is chat GPT  which stands for gender generative  pre-trained Transformer  which is the the GPT in  chat and so chat EBT there was actually  a  former AI it was called instruct GPT  which was a comparison processor which  was the pre-text to chat GPT and this  chat GPT  like we like like I said it's a it's a  chat bot that takes variables and then  spits out responses so within AI there  are something called it there's a  trigger and there's a response  and based on your trigger so if I say hi  Sydney  you know to say something back to me and  your response is based on my trigger  that's the same way the human the human  brain works right so if I were to say  something offensive to you you would  know  to respond accordingly so if I were to  say something like  do you like hockey you wouldn't respond  with I prefer baking you know like I  like to bake right because it doesn't it  doesn't match the  the trigger and so how AI works is it  reads over triggers understands triggers  and then based on triggers it knows how  to respond  so that's kind of the Baseline here of  of chat GPT and we're going to get into  you know we're gonna nerd out on this a  little bit Sydney so I hope you're ready  for this that's okay I'm excited so  first off before we dive into this  Christmas just happened yeah and so we  have to talk a little bit about  Christmas before we dive into some  potential ever World a worldly ending  type of AI conversation well for them it  might be like the first episode of the  new year  I guess it would be it is that what  we're at are we at the because we do it  on Monday yeah the first episode of the  new year because we just did we just  released we just did the wrap up yeah  the wrap up so this would be the first  episode of the new year wow so happy New  Year yeah thanks for everybody listening  yeah me too so if it is the new year and  it's the first Monday of the new year  that means that and that's the that  noise you just heard is the every  episode Sydney drops her phone always  always something that's what that is  okay so now you know how we're off to a  good start  the  if it's the new year then we've started  75 hard  are you doing 75 hard with us are we are  you on day one of 75 hard right now  let's let's look into the future a  10-piece chicken nugget on the way here  well that's okay because it's not  actually January 1st yet but we are  starting 75 hard for those of you don't  know what 75 heart is uh just give it a  little  Google  it's uh it all has to do with like  self-discipline and instilling  self-discipline through a few different  things so if you want to do it with us I  would encourage you to do it with us  Sydney's going to be doing it  she doesn't she doesn't know it yet but  she's doing it with us I'm doing it  there's like three people within our  company who are doing it my brothers  well  he's on the fence yeah I feel like I'm  in his boat yeah while you're doing it  and we'll talk about it  we'll we'll we'll uh document I've got a  lot on my plate right  I know but what's one more thing right  exactly what's one more thing so  artificial intelligence let's dive into  it because well actually before we go  before we go from talking about New  Year's into AI do you have a New Year's  resolution do you do that no I don't  know uh I want a house you're like  that's a good one yeah which we're in  the process I was about to say when this  podcast comes out you might have a house  maybe that'd be pretty awesome we'll see  is this like when you think of your  dream house is this the one that does  this come to mind like just check all  the boxes yeah yeah when if you would  ever to ask me like what I wanted I  would say a yellow house  um some sort of like Farmhouse like an  old house which is a old yellow  Farmhouse so I'm so excited it's not by  the beach but one day we'll get there It  Is by cornfield though so that is  that's cool yeah that means that  nobody's gonna be building behind you  right exactly they're not gonna be  neighbors exactly  that's very excited that is that's  awesome that's um so fingers crossed  yeah I'll be say a little prayer for you  that's a big thing for  people my age  it's a huge deal yeah how old are you 28  28.  I bought my first house at 28. so you're  right on par how about that good no I I  and but  you're super young yeah  I would not have been able to buy my  first house at 28 had I not had a little  bit I had a little bit of help  yeah oh yeah we have a we'll get the VA  though that's a good one so that is how  we are buying that which we're super  lucky because obviously most people yeah  don't have that yeah well and your  fiance served so right we're able to do  zero money too that's pretty awesome  which is the only reason that we are  getting a house potentially but  yeah wow big things get married I mean  that is not married this year yeah God  willing nobody wins Away by you you or  Evan or I think I am marrying you  legally not marrying you I am official  officiating  yeah I'm excited about that  I'm so excited yeah that you got a big  year I know this is a huge year for you  wedding house I just want to like get  through the year and not lose my mind I  think yeah well that's not gonna happen  I just want it yeah it's it's big  responsibilities August is your wedding  right yeah yeah so you have like all  year to just think of plan and just go  crazy about it I have a year half a year  eight months is a little more than half  a year well it's beginning with August  so like really like seven and then  you'll get married and basically go off  are you doing the honeymoon the same  time of the wedding like how's that  working out I know I don't think so  we'll probably wait until a little bit  longer I think because I think where  we're going we get like a  for a couple days like the next year  um posts are going like out of the  country so okay  it's kind of like so Christmas and New  Year's and everything that we're talking  about we just did we just went through  it was going to look drastically  different for you next year yeah maybe  No Maybe  I mean you won't be in the same house  God willing yeah I hope not you'll be  married you'll have a different last  name are you changing your last name  mm-hmm  I think so big big move  it's a lot of paperwork I know  Big Move new last name new house husband  well I had heard from somebody to like  just make your last name like current  like your middle name yeah yeah that's a  that's a pretty popular Trend these days  I don't think I mean I have a brother we  can carry it on do you have any like um  strong feelings towards your middle name  is it just like a generic white girl  name Josephine Josephine yeah does that  mean anything like an old lady name um  it's my grandma's middle okay so you do  have a bit of a tie too  to your middle name  I never loved it to be honest with you I  don't hate it but I never loved it yeah  no I'll keep it you could always go two  middle names I could but I I moved my  last name to your middle name I'll just  get rid of it  it's pretty generic so my wife dropped  just dropped her last name yeah yeah but  she has a brother like you have brother  he carried on the name and  good there you know mm-hmm  well that's exciting exciting things  happening for  for Sydney in in 2023 which maybe this  tool this Chachi petite will will help  you alleviate some of that stress which  we're about to talk about to help you  with some of the year because you do a  lot of marketing yeah yeah and I I just  looked something up before we started  this I'll read it to you which is pretty  cool well I want to hear that okay so  essentially do you ever remember like  when you um this like reminds me of when  you would go on like a I am like back in  the day and they had like those little  robot things like in chat rooms that you  could talk to did you ever do that yes I  did that's kind of what it is it's  essentially the same thing not as smart  right but so this is this is so that's  that's a great point this chat EBT is  not new technology right the the the  technology the responses the triggers  the artificial intelligence the you say  something it says something back is not  new I mean Ask Jeeves you could say even  did this back in the 90s not to this  extent granted and this is aimed at more  towards the creative I think that some  of the AI that we've seen because we  also saw the  drawing  yeah I try to get Roy to do that but he  wouldn't do it he would not do it with  me that okay like ten eight dollars and  get like a bunch of images of yourself  it was not about the money for me the  the freakiness of it yeah they're cool I  liked it it is pretty cool now and now  they're all over my my socials I'm just  gonna do it for you so this was a  prototype this chat gbt it was a  prototype that was launched in November  of of this year so  a month we're a month into this right at  this point people are losing losing  their minds right now  and so the the big thing about this and  why it has become such a big deal is how  accessible it is to anyone anyone can go  to this bot  and ask it questions and it's accessible  through an open API and for those of you  who are open AI rather sorry but it does  have open apis with it and so for those  of you who don't know what an open API  is an open API is an is an open Tunnel  of information that can connect to  things so an API if we had or if we  controlled our own database instead of  of just I don't know  things that we did in a day and we we  just added them into a database an Excel  sheet that was public to the internet  and we could plug it into this chatbot  then we could ask this  chat GPT hey what did Sydney do on the  morning of X date and he could pull it  up quickly now imagine that with the  entire internet yeah so it's not just  what did Sydney and I do uh it's  everything that ever happened on the  internet  there are in such a short amount of time  it can wrap it yeah exactly that's the  scariest part about this is that you and  I have to process things  and we're limited by our own brain this  is not limited by really anything right  because as technology evolves  the ability for it to to read and I say  that in quotation marks and comprehend  will only get faster  and it it blows human intelligence out  of the water right  in terms of how much it can do how much  you can read and how much you can  comprehend and it's only getting only  getting better and  mind you it does make mistakes as  frequently as we do right  so artificial intelligence really  started to hit Market  2011 ish where it had a 25 percent  higher error rate than humans so it was  getting things wrong so when you you're  talking about aim and everything like  that  yeah but we could talk to it it would  get things wrong and you would be like  ah  right sorry I don't know that you're  like all right whatever then 2012  a little over 15  2013 a little over 10 so it's getting  smarter erroring less  2014  a little over five percent which five  percent error is the human  error now  2015 it became better than humans  in terms of error so just under five  percent error wild that was what seven  years ago yeah  so yeah the error rate now is  it's not zero because even this new  chappy GPT that has come out  has  error and so what they're calling it is  hallucination  where I would say  Sydney what's your favorite pie  and you would be like baseball  you're like wow it's it's not  necessarily wrong  it's just I mean it is wrong but it's  wrong in a different sense of like hey  what's two plus two instead of you  saying five  it's saying Saturn right it's a it's  totally off base hallucination  and that's that's could be you know it  could be a lot of different things where  we talked about those trigger words and  so it's looking for a very specific  thing so if I say like  I played a sport and after I played my  sport I always liked to eat  you know oranges  what did you like to eat after your you  played sports right and it could be  reading that sentence and focusing on  Sports as the trigger word and it's  saying oh well Sports I like baseball  and responding baseball as a that could  be a reason for the hallucination or it  could just be querying incorrectly and  so  the error rate on these things is much  better than humans that's something that  we have to correspond to but the the  existence of these solutionizations  they do exist in here and so Sydney and  I have been running through  scenarios I think we started with  different very different scenarios it  definitely sent through different so  what have you sent through so my first  thing I said was write me a Hallmark  Christmas movie  and it started coming up just writing a  whole script titled A Christmas in  America a Christmas miracle in Maple  Falls and gave me like a whole plot of a  movie basically character names  oh yeah Julia she's a successful  businesswoman she goes back to her  hometown of maple Falls  um to her late aunts bed and breakfast  that's going to be foreclosed on  um she reconnects with an old friend a  Charming local contractor Jack who helps  her and then basically they fall in love  and realize the whole meaning of  Christmas is love and finding happiness  where you are wow  but like a full four paragraphs and so  Jack would you say whatever was what's  the Jack and Julia Jack and Julia  well there you go Hallmark and so that's  the scariest part I think about the new  AIS is so everybody had kind of had this  idea of AI and artificial intelligence  and automation it's and it's going to  replace jobs and it's going to take jobs  which sure it's going to take away jobs  that just it's not a will it take away  jobs it is going to take away jobs it's  just what jobs is it going to take away  has always been the question if you  think about any Revolution that we've  ever had within America you talk about  the Industrial Revolution when we're  talking about machinery and mechanic  people don't stand in a field anymore  pulling through rope a plow  right we had animals and then we got  animals to do that  and then people were like well what  about the people who were gonna pull it  okay well you got an animal now and then  while the tractor comes  and it replaces you know the horse or  the ox or whatever you were using  what about the animals or job right or  what about the people who have to care  for the animals okay well now we have a  machine that can do this now those  people who used to take care of the  animals  could learn how to take care of this  machine  it's gonna break down  and so  Ai and automation was thought well what  about the person who has to  like you're an executive assistant here  for me  if we were in the same office together  and I would say I fill out something and  hand it to you and then you walk it down  the hall  and handed somebody else to sign  well if I have an automated system that  does that does that take away your job  like have I been like hey said I no  longer need you to file paperwork see ya  now  you've learned other things and you've  you've progressed into other areas of  the business and that's kind of the same  thing that we're about to see at a  global  scale right because of this Automation  and artificial intelligence that's  always something that the thought  process is that  automation is going to replace the  low-level workers that was always the  idea  sure and then there was something too  about like okay well the creative jobs  and things like that they're going to be  last right which is actually not true  right because they also have another  version of this I think it was called  like doll doll e or something like that  um that does like generates images and  you see this a lot on like Tick Tock or  there's like a new filter yeah you can  take a picture and it'll change it into  like an anime  like image of something or you can type  in something and then it'll generate a  random image okay so if it has the  ability to go through every single image  it's ever seen right on the internet and  come up with a new image  where I think  um there's a thing where it like can  create a person right I can't that's not  a real person right um and like come up  with all these different variations so  if it has a the ability to go through  all these things and create something  new okay so then what if you are right  like a logo designer or something like  that yeah graphic designers what is  stopping that from right taking your job  because you're exactly right the  creatives were thought to be the last  ones to go because the human brain we  can we play off of the emotions and we  understand how it is and we can be  creative like no machine can  well now these artificial intelligence  and these AIS and these Bots they're  constantly scanning the internet that's  how they're learning or a writer like it  just wrote a movie script for me  obviously it didn't go fully in depth  but I mean it could  right it summarized every single you  know Hallmark movie and Basics exactly  what you need for the basics and put an  idea in you know 10 seconds I wonder if  you could expand upon that  to say what's the first scene in my  Hallmark movie yeah try that and let's  see let's see what happens because  I'm  I am that's where I'm most scared of  this and not necessarily scared but  this technology of replacing creatives  was not thought to be available yet that  we had time to comprehend  the possibility of super intelligence  and how it could replace  humans and and how we interact and how  we  go about our business lives like I  talked about the Industrial Revolution  you know all all the different  revolutions that we've had in terms of  electricity uh you know robots mechanics  the internet  all of it changed the way  we did work but ultimately the work was  still being done in the same fashion we  were still plowing Fields now a human  doesn't have to pull it then it was an  ox okay now Ox doesn't have to do it now  it's a machine we're still plowing  fields  we humans still have to interact in some  form of fashion but what if the robot  plows the field what does the human then  do  right  oh and by the way now okay yeah sure you  can fix the robot but what if you build  a robot that fixes robots  what does the human do and so there is a  program  right now it's been going on for a  couple years  within Washington called and you're not  going to be able to Google this because  it doesn't exist on the internet so  you're just gonna have to trust me  it's called  life after work  and so the idea is  if artificial intelligence well let me  rephrase that when artificial  intelligence takes all of our jobs  what do we do  what is the purpose of humans and how do  we interact and how do we conduct Our  Lives which is a really hard thing to  think about right now because so much of  the way that we as humans identify  ourselves like what's the first question  when you meet somebody  that you ask what do you do what do you  do right because we identify ourselves  so much with work  it's our self-worth is wrapped into what  it is that we do for a living our  financials everything is wrapped up into  this identity identity that we have  created for ourselves around a job or  profession  so  what happens when that profession ceases  to exist then who are we and what do we  do  what's the next question that we ask  each other I don't know and so that  question that is being kind of tallied  around within Washington and his life  after work and it's solving that  identity and then if you look even  further  into this is  the ability to create energy  which  I believe it we just broke through  recently in technology of the ability of  fusion look up Fusion Energy for me  because I believe there was I believe  this just happened in the last  month where researchers had the ability  to potentially break through and create  Fusion Energy  are you getting anything  yeah let's see here patient energy  breakthrough is huge  yes there was a breakthrough so yeah and  this was 10 days ago  Fusion Energy is the ability to create  energy from energy  so it's just  we would no longer need your battery  Wouldn't Die  you wouldn't need to go fill up gasoline  you would just drop an atom  into your car  and your car would run forever  you would uh drop an atom into  your house  grid and your power would just run  forever  and it would never need to  recharge because it recharges itself  it uses the energy to create new energy  that  so okay so if we never need to pay  another power bill  and we never need to do another job  then what do we do  right right  and if you look at the ancient Greeks  they were philosophers because a lot of  the Greeks didn't have to do anything  either just sit around and think they  just thought around sat around and  thought and that progressed Humanity  and many people will point to  democracy  so much human progression that happened  because  people were just allowed to sit around  and think so what what do we do when we  have a super intelligence that's smarter  than anything that already knows  everything it could ever be yeah we  don't need to sit around and think  anymore because this machine already has  the answer what are we gonna find out  that this machine doesn't already know  that is scary that's a scary part I  agree because we've replaced ourselves  anything that could ever be invented it  will be invented by this machine no  longer a human which I believe that's  one of the quotes is when the human  invents artificial intelligence so that  is so Superior  I.E super intelligence will be the last  thing that humans ever invent  exactly yeah I do it's scary  it's terrifying and there was we're  talking about mostly a video too that we  watched I forget what it's called well a  lot of what he talks about in this video  is clips from other things it's clips  from other things that are and  this is not new in fact we've talked  about this on this show multiple times  about super intelligence and the ability  to  um update itself  right which I thought I found it  interesting he started talking about  like um  like aliens and like going to different  planets and things like that and we've  talked about this a little bit too like  um I think about like Elon Musk and Life  on Mars or whatever well you know what's  stopping us from sending a  super intelligent AI robot up into space  that doesn't have to eat and doesn't  have to drink and doesn't need air and  can fix itself and  we talked about there you go we talked  about who is going to if Elon is going  to inhabit Mars right and that's his  goal  right  who's going to build the dome for us to  live at Mars  an AI robot an AI robot and we talked  about that and we actually made our own  movie plot where we said hey  humans send AI robots to Mars  the robots realize that their only job  is to build this Dome and after the Dome  is completed they would no longer serve  a purpose in the universe and so they  turn on humans  create their own  World Mars  and then we are at war with the robots  who inhabit Mars so I just asked  um the chat GPD or GDP whatever it's  called I said write me a movie plot  where AI robots take over oh God  called the rise of the Machines is what  it is it's writing it right now in a  future where Advanced AI robots have  become an integral part of everyday life  a group of rebels discover that the  machines have been programmed to take  over the world  I like how it threw in programmed and  not like realized I thought yeah they  could it's theirselves  programmed to take over the world so  here is here is the big question is so I  read something the other day that said  that Jarvis which is another AI tool  that's out there Jarvis has already read  10 of the internet  crazy  how you can read the internet at all but  where we're at right now with Society  Jarvis has read 10 of the internet  to put that into perspective the  internet consists of data and bits  there are more bits of sand I'm sorry  there are more bits of data in the cloud  cloud is the internet there are more  bits of data in the cloud than there are  bits of sand  in the world  so this artificial intelligence bot  Jarvis  you shouldn't call it a bot this this  artificial intelligence  Jarvis  has read or counted ten percent of the  internet that's like counting 10 percent  of the sand  on Earth and it's been around for a few  years  so it's just getting started right and  at the point when it does finally finish  knowing everything about the internet by  the way you're connected to the internet  at all times I'm wearing a watch right  now that's connected to the internet at  all times telling me my heartbeat  telling me my my location telling me  when I wake when I stand up when I woke  up how much sleep I got last night so  this machines after they read all this  will be able to understand  not not to the point of when I wake up  and when I go to sleep but more so to  change my habits to be more productive  yeah  more and it's asleep and it could  recommend products to me non-bias  not like Hey Sydney buy these shoes  because you'll be able to run faster but  no it'll actually know Sydney hey the  way that you stand is X Y and Z wear  these shoes and you'll be able to live  another three years because oh by the  way I know when you're going to die  you know like right and I think that's  the goal right of that's what they say  yeah and that's what we always try to  get up to yes it's scary yes can be  crazy but the point is  it's a thing that's happening and it  could be a good thing and you need to  kind of harness it in a way that  can help you right be more productive  right we can we can and I feel like we  have gone a little Doom and Gloom on  this web on this podcast over the last  couple episodes  this is not all gloom and doom No in  fact super intelligence is not even a  real thing yet right and that's when it  becomes more or not more smarter  smarter then we could never be right  which that's what I asked chat gbt I  asked it the first thing I said is what  podcast should I start  and it said there are many great  podcasts out there so it really depends  on your interests so it doesn't really  give me anything and it's good at that  when you asked about what their favorite  pie is it said I'm artificial  intelligence so I don't have personal  preference to eat food but this is what  I can tell you right what pie is it to  give you I said there are many different  types of pie including fruit pies cream  pies and savory I didn't say like this  is the most popular pie some popular  flavors include Apple pumpkin pecan and  chocolate okay what's your favorite type  of oh wait I asked you a question  don't answer the question  seriously  I don't do it because it will it'll  that's how it learns so the way that  artificial intelligence learns is  through Gathering data the more data  that it has the more data they can  present so Microsoft which we talked  about it's chat Tay  uh the tabot that went rogue after 24  hours that went like total on Twitter  yeah on Twitter  which uh they just unblocked the bot you  still can't uh interact with it but you  can read its old tweets  they're bad I need to go back there  because I had never heard of it so I'm  very curious yeah it's still there now  Tay took 24 hours to be before it needed  to be shut down Google built a chat AI  that was never even released what four  years ago right yeah that that was crazy  to listen to because it sounded like a  super intelligent human being it sounds  like a human now why was never released  Google has never really probably still  working on it answers that  and then you have this chat GPT that it  had now is in beta  so the way that these things learn  though like Microsoft releases a  learning platform for students and so  you can actually go to  capitalpresence.com you can go to our  resources page and then there it will  actually take you to  Microsoft's learning page and in there  it will ask you  you know  go through these images and tell me  which one of them are Eagles or Bobcats  was one of the ones that came up to us  and you go through and you click and you  click where the Bobcat is every single  time that you do that it's learning a  little bit more about bobcats and I  believe that is well you had to do this  even to get on this website how to pick  where the stairs were and which pictures  and so every time you do that it's  training is it a captcha yes it's  proving that you're human but at the  same time it's teaching this artificial  intelligence what stairs are  and then confirming then they the  artificial intelligence confirms yes  those are stairs okay she said that  they're stairs so I know that these are  also stairs and so it is confirming its  knowledge of of stairs at the same time  that it's confirming that you're a human  and I think it needs ten thousand it's  either a thousand or ten thousand images  of something in order for it to  understand what it is  so every time that you tell something  that is a [ __ ] this is a fox you're  you're creating a smarter AI  so by you telling that machine what your  favorite  Pi is  you are entering into the data verse so  to speak  of pie so it's going to your  your contributing to the downfall of  humanity by answering that oh no no no  by answering that question  but but that's how that's how it learns  right  and so whether or not super intelligence  ever  exists which  it's a theory and I and I that's what I  asked Chad GP like I said and I said  there is an ongoing debate among  scientists philosophers and  technologists about the possibility of  creating a super intelligent being  defined as an intelligence that's what  does that say significantly exceeds the  cognitive performance of humans in  virtually all domains and interests so  that's that's important to note will so  we talked about that bot that placed  chess  I forget what its name is but that bot  is only good at chess but it's better  than every human at chess that bot is  also not better at baseball than me  right right but super intelligence will  be better at everything  and better than all humans combined at  that thing at everything so not only  will we be the best helicopter pilot  but it'll also be the best chess player  and cook and everything that's the idea  of super intelligence so it'll it'll con  uh it'll outperform humans in virtually  all domains of Interest some believe  that it is possible to create a super  intelligent being either through  development of advanced artificial  intelligence or through some other means  While others are more skeptical  but uh if you're going to be skeptical  in these in today's age of artificial  intelligence being smarter than a human  at this point then you're just you're  being angry yeah  so whether or not can One Singular  AI can be better than everybody at  everything that's I think that's the  theory could you have multiple Bots that  are better yeah but through the uh iot  do you know what iot stands for it's the  internet of things so okay  I'm sure you use iot every single day  and you just don't realize it but iot is  just things talking to each other so if  you have a Bluetooth do you have like a  bluetooth printer at your house  so that uh that video system that you  just showed me yes for my dogs for your  dogs and so what does that camera do  I can it's just an app that I can  back to your house connect to my phone  and yeah I mean this little camera but  it's also an app and you can talk to  your you can talk to my dogs talk to  your dogs and I think there was an  option where you could feed them too  right  they do have them yeah can you it so the  one that you bought is a totally  different one or you can can you buy the  add-on  no they do make them know that they put  treats in and you can like flick it yeah  and it'll fly out that's probably not  good for my dogs but um yes they do you  can't do that so that camera connects to  the internet yep which then connects to  your phone and that's how you can  interact and now if it could connect to  another thing connected to that same  internet Network right then that's iot  so all things are connected to the  internet  and you can control those things via the  Internet and then other things on the  network can control other things on your  network so if that  so Alexa is a great example Alexa you  say Alexa turn on my lights turned on  what Alexa turn on the TV turns on the  TV Alexa tune to you know YouTube TV and  turns on YouTube TV that's internet of  things all things are connected through  Bluetooth  yeah to an extent and the Wi-Fi more so  now the internet's open  so  super intelligence  could be possible through  all Bots connected to the internet  talking to one another  so if you said to your chat gbt  turn on my microwave  then if my microwave had Wi-Fi it could  turn on my microwave because sure all  things are connected through this  ecosystem which you're already starting  to see some of the dangers of that like  um  one of those home systems called Hive or  whatever you know what I'm talking about  with the  the thermostats yeah  those things will lock up people will go  in and they'll hack the next system and  they'll turn everybody's thermostats up  to 100 have you seen those those like  articles yeah Google that article  there's Google Nest hacking  100 degrees or something like that I bet  you I bet you the one I think there will  be a ton of them and I bet you one  happened like recently  well you always see like with the weird  like stories too there'll be like a baby  monitor or something and then like a  young man is like hacking that that's so  creepy so I bring this up to say that  iot The Internet of Things taking  hacking into Google did you find it  hacker takes over smart home by hacking  into Google yeah  there's tons of them right  yeah  blasted vulgar music raised temperature  to 90 degrees 90 degrees Yeah geez so  the Internet of Things is super  vulnerable so the target hacked that  remember when Target got hacked yeah and  their people lost I got caught in that  too do you know how your credit card I  did yeah they stole my identity I've had  my identity so only five times  when I worked for the government I  hadn't stolen twice no no yeah OPM so  office of uh personnel management that's  OPM for the government got hacked twice  while I was working yeah  I'm like if you want to find me I'm on  the dark web somewhere you can just just  take my identity whatever who cares I  just bent down that road but  Target was hacked through do you know  how it was hacked through the HVAC  system  they had a smart HVAC system that was  connected to the internet  wasn't there a thing like a couple years  ago when they were like like hospitals  were hacked yeah I remember that HVAC  security which is Nest type of things  so HVAC is uh uh heating and air that's  essentially what is it the heating  system or an air conditioning system and  since those heating and air systems are  connected to the internet and connected  to the network because that's how it  knows to fluctuate the temperature based  on  how many people are there or geolocation  or the the temperature outside or  whatever you set it to right  it's a huge huge  vulnerability in a system because most  of people don't think about building  security systems around their HVAC  because why would I  you know I have a firewall you know and  so okay but hackers were able to enter  into the HVAC get into the main systems  obtain Financial records through the  HVAC system and get out  that's why one of my good friends does  HVAC security for the Pentagon Pentagon  has HVAC security I would never even  think about it it's a whole that's why  thing  it's a whole like Division and security  for my air conditioner right I would  never think it's and so the iot is  extremely vulnerable so I bring that up  to say that if a super intelligence is  able to  be created either on purpose or through  the evolution of the of the artificial  intelligence right who's going to stop  the somebody from going in and doing  exactly what we just talked about with  this plot of artificial intelligence and  in the world where somebody what did it  say somebody what  right they were programmed  to do what to take over the world take  over the world  machines have been programmed the  machines have been programmed right  which would happen through a fault in  the iot of the connectivity of  superintelligence that's how that would  happen so thank you chat GPT for  creating this uh Conversation Piece but  if we if we go on the super intelligence  there are a number of challenges and  open questions that need to be addressed  in order to create a super intelligent  being for example it isn't is not clear  how to define a measure super  intelligence or what the implications of  such intelligence would be for society  and individual  it that's the questions that we talked  about at the beginning of this episode  was  there are conversations being held right  now in Washington around life after work  and what does it mean if Sydney is  you know a podcast host executive  assistant marketer insert what you do  here if that's stripped from you  and instruct from everybody  what do we ask each other like  you don't think for yourself anymore  what what's your identity  that's a that's a terrifying question to  ask so so with this chat gbt  I think that there are like like let's  get away from the gloom and doom for a  second and this off in a good spot but  I also asked it so you asked it to write  scripts for movies script I did ask it  to write a lot of what I do I said write  me an Instagram post about on  and I like what it wrote Because I  said automation has revolutionized the  way we work and has made many tasks more  efficient and easier to manage but it's  important to remember that while  technology can be great a great tool it  is not a replacement for human  connection and creativity let's Embrace  automation but also prioritize the  importance of human interaction and  problem solving in our daily lives  hashtag automation hashtag technology  hashtag human connection hashtag work  forever exactly which was like exactly  kind of what we is that weird a little  bit right right that's exactly that's  like something that would come out of my  mind in like in an Instagram caption  right and you've got our company  specifically right I mean I think our  Instagram bio says a human-centric  approach to automation meaning humans  need to be in the center of this which I  think we've done what three or four  episodes about collaborative  intelligence yep what's collaborative  intelligence is humans as part of the  ecosystem so the data  the artificial intelligence goes and  gets the data presents it to you which  even when I asked it hey give me a cold  call script for somebody emailing  somebody about automation it said hello  name  my name is your name I'm calling from  your company there's still a human  portion of this that has to exist right  even if something is you know writing  out something for you there needs to be  somebody right on the back end still  tracking it which is why it's so  important because imagine you know it  could take you hours and hours and hours  to get through all your emails or  something like that when you can just  say hey  go through my emails and write a  response whatever you just okay it and  then imagine how much more time in your  day and you could do other things yeah  how much more people you could reach  exactly now think of it this way think  of it if you had this artificial  intelligence and you approved this  cold call  and  it was like the googlebot who could  physically dial people and have a  conversation with them back and forth as  if it was a bot you if I had you do it  you can be on the phone with one person  at a time  this machine could be on the phone with  infinite number of people  and they know exactly who you're  your client is what they like what their  demographics are and they since you we  are all connected through social  willingly giving up our likes and  dislikes and favorites and where we're  checking in and I was at the bar last  week and I was at a Caps game and we're  checking in at these places  the AI knows  who you're looking for what their  interests are and can hold a  conversation with them  and not only one at a time  infinite number of people at the same  time  that's a  clear perk for where this could go in  terms of business relations in the  future sure I still think that there  should be human intervention I I know  there should be human intervention but  in terms of a  SDR or a bdr so somebody who's just  their job is to make cold calls and  present them to a sales rep for human  intervention  this could absolutely  assist with that  so it's pretty crazy this is chat gbt  let us let us know guys what you think  about it  in the comments if you think this is a  good thing a bad thing I love it I might  use that caption tomorrow use it I say  use it I I mean  that's the message that we're trying to  get yes there should be we should  approach artificial intelligence with  caution because I do I do view  artificial intelligence as the new the  next nuclear bomb does that mean that we  should stop all nuclear research and no  because it it is a it could be a it  could be a great source of power  electricity energy should we be able to  harness it should artificial  intelligence be completely wiped off the  Earth no because there's a ton of good  that it can do it just needs to be we  just all need to have this conversation  so we proceed with caution so I want you  to use chappy chat DPT and then use this  and then you plug it into our systems  which what do we use for auto posting  and there's tons of them out there do we  use canva yeah so we just posted into  canva you create the next quarter of  automation I bet you it could create a  marketing plan for us  and then but we still have to carry it  out through human intervention you can  do video and things like that that's the  this is a tool here treat it as a tool  don't try and take over the world with  it please guys we're not ready for that  for that yet and uh  yeah I'm excited to see where it goes  I I definitely asked it a bunch of other  questions that were more like trying to  trick it up  I asked it uh what's the most attractive  trait in a female  I asked that  give me a billion dollar business idea  give me ideas how to propose to a woman  like these ones that are clearly like  creative right and yeah same thing I  said what's a perfect first date it's  it's very good about knowing that's  subjective right that needs like a human  opinion but it can differ here are some  ideas  um or you know when I did ask it to  write like a specific  um  script it told me that it didn't have  enough information about my characters  and plot but here are some ideas for uh  the first scene in a Hallmark Christmas  movie for you right yep and so that's  where that's where all this is headed is  well hopefully it is headed towards  collaborative intelligence so there'll  always be a human intervention and we  will see the evolution of work many  people believe that this is going to be  a totally different than the internet  Because the Internet disrupted work and  it just reorganized the way that we did  work this has the possibility to totally  replace work so that's where people are  a little bit scared but  you know I I think that  figure out ways that you can utilize it  within your business make a plan around  it you still need to plan you still need  to design how you're going to use it  before you dive into this if it's here  use it to your advantage get used to it  now don't go hiring or don't go laying  off your marketing team no don't go  laying off people that's the exact  opposite of what you need to be doing  because otherwise you're going to be  sending out  hallucinate uh hallucinations yeah of  this machine and you're going to lose  business and that'll be that'll be  really bad but maybe we'll do another  podcast and we'll get into some of the  the pros and cons of this going forward  and we'll we're definitely going to  continue to talk about this this is not  the last time that we're going to be  talking about no people wanted to hear  we asked them uh what they wanted to  hear about in 2023 and people said  automation it's that automation so we're  going to be talking about this a lot so  any final words before we we get out of  this I know you're excited about chat  qbt I love it I'm gonna play with it  later there we go all right guys well  thanks for hanging out  thanks guys  it's been a pleasure hit us a like
