 this AR tool is taking over the world  and if you don't adapt you may just get  left behind it's called chat GPT it's an  AI based text generation tool that can  talk to you like a human being so if  you're a college student or a recent  graduate who was worried that AI might  steal your job well you should be my  name is Toby and like many of you  watching this I spent the past 16 years  learning and preparing for my future  career but with chat GPT and other AI  Technologies now able to perform these  tasks better than humans  none of it mattered none of it the  mitochondria more like might not conjure  a job  soap intercept formula more like  intercept your job and leave you with  nothing  so if you plan on making a living in the  future economy listen closely because in  this video we'll be talking about Chad  GPT and what it means for your future  will AI render your hard-earned degree  useless will you be left with nothing  but a pile of debt and zero job  prospects is anyone safe from the ripple  effect of AI technology watch this video  to the very end because the answer may  surprise you  so what is chat GPT we are talking about  chat GPT a state-of-the-art  conversational AI model developed by  openai chat GPT is capable of engaging  in human-like conversations providing  answers to questions and even generating  original content that little  introduction was written by chat GPT  itself after just a short prompt from  May  so then I asked it to help me with part  two of this video which is what jobs are  at risk due to the AI Revolution for a  long time the conversation around  automation was mainly applied to only a  select group of workers you may have  heard of the term blue collar workers or  white collar workers Chad GPT describes  the difference as follows blue collar  workers typically work manual labor jobs  a work in fields including construction  manufacturing and oftentimes have  specialized skills such as welding  mechanics or electrical repair they  oftentimes wear uniforms or protective  gear on the job white collar workers on  the other hand are typically  professionals or managers who work in  office settings they may have degrees in  specialized Fields such as Finance  business education Etc white collar  workers typically wear business attire  and do not typically perform manual  labor at first people were concerned  that as robots became more sophisticated  they were going to take away jobs from  blue collar workers and it happened step  into almost any McDonald's in the United  States and there are one or two human  cashiers and then like five giant  touchscreens that can take your order  just as those smart kiosks left a few  blue collar workers at McDonald's Donald  without a job Advanced AI presents an  existential crisis for white-collar  employees I actually asked chat gbt to  help me come up with a list of jobs that  AI is going to take from humans and then  it said the most PR safe response  imaginable but I asked it again nicely  and it gave me a list of jobs and  corresponding college majors that are  now rendered useless thanks to AI a list  of how artificial intelligence or AI  could render you unemployed as written  by AI first up is data entry this  includes Majors business admin I.T  computer science and there's  manufacturing this affects the following  Majors industrial engineering  manufacturing engineering and Material  Science and there's customer service  marketing and also communication data  analysis data science Majors economics  marketing which affects marketing majors  business administration majors and  communication major financial analysis  affect Finance management accounting  management translation Linguistics  management language major Research  Medical Science three a lot of people  are going to be affected wait a second  actually um AI didn't mention my film  degree in that so um who's got the  useless major now with the Advent of AI  even the safe Majors that your parents  pressured you to consider are looking  like they ultimately lead to an  uncertain future so what was it all for  are we all just destined for  unemployment is this the end for  Humanity as we know it maybe but that  doesn't mean that it's the end of the  world there's definitely something that  we can still do about it one way to  think about AI is as a tool that assists  humans rather than a replacement for  human labor there's been a shift in  recent years that emphasizes skills over  degrees in the job market according to a  recent press release from the world  economic Forum in 2025 analytical  thinking creativity and flexibility will  be some of the top skills needed in the  workforce additionally the top emerging  professions are expected to be in the  fields of data artificial intelligence  content creation yes sir yes sir and  cloud computing so what does that  ultimately mean for college students as  a college student who wants to be  employed it's important to focus on  developing a diverse set of skills that  will make you valuable to an employer in  a variety of different fields this might  include technical skills to programming  and data analysis but it could also  include soft skills such as  communication collaboration and  creativity so if you're a student or a  recent grad don't just focus on getting  your degree make sure you also develop a  wide range of skills and stay up to date  on the latest trends and Technologies  because in the end our ability to Pivot  and adapt to new methods and  technologies will Define our future  success what if I told you this entire  video was written by AI it's not but a  few parts of it were if you want to know  the exact breakdown head over to the  community tab on my channel now do you  think chat GPT is a fad or is this truly  the start of something new let me know  in the comments below if you like this  video like
