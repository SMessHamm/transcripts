 foreign  [Music]  I'm really excited about the future and  the promise and potential of artificial  intelligence but I think far too much of  the online dialogue has been about the  extractive uses of it and what I want to  posit here is that regenerative  artificial intelligence I.E generative  artificial intelligence that is applied  to regenerative purposes is where the  impact potential is that inspires me  with these new technologies and tools so  I've worked on that in the spirit of  back casting from a solar Punk future or  future fit for your future self in the  world in the context of human dialogue  and I think that's still extremely  important and I've also been learning in  collaboration with regenerative  artificial intelligence to create more  empirical dimensions and interdiscipline  plenary dimensions and wisdom  perspectives to integrate in order to  reach a regenerative future and I think  that that's more possible than ever  before via regenerative artificial  intelligence tools and so we created a  course in that Spirit on chatgpt and  novel Ai and also on other tools  including using stable diffusion and  perplexity and applying these tools and  Technologies for the purposes we think  regenerative artificial intelligence is  meant in other words how can I work  backwards from a future in which humans  are thriving in collaboration with  biodiversity and are learning from  ancient knowledge and from our profound  diversity of neurodiversity  interdisciplinary diversity and  perspectives in order to create Parallax  based on what we all can see better  together and that can let us reach a  future that inspires us most thoroughly  and so in that spirit I would like to  invite you all to join us we have 2 500  students already here six days into  launching the course and I'm very  grateful for the chance to create a  community of practice of humans aiming  to Back cast from a future fit for our  future selves and in that Spirit I'd  love to invite you all to look in the  video description for a link to the  course and looking forward to sharing a  Learning Journey with you all so that we  can reach a future that inspires us most  thoroughly  foreign  [Music]
