 chat GPT can write mid-journey commands  to generate beautiful art these commands  can be properly formatted so you can get  that artwork in just three clicks not  only can it generate slash imagine  commands but it can also make use of  aspect ratio multi-prompt and even  prefer options if you want to get good  at creating compelling AI art chat gbt  is a tool that you are going to want to  master but make sure you watch to the  end because without the secret prompt  that I'm going to share in this video  chatgpt barely understands what AI art  is and seems to be miles away from  generating it hi my name is liberty and  this channel is all about exploring the  landscape of AI experiences I have loved  large language models well before  chatgpt came along so much so that years  ago I was in awe with Parsi mcparse face  and more recently I bought an AI dungeon  subscription before I ever played the  game because that was the only way I  could try gbt3 at the time I think the  fact that chat GPT has become such a  phenomenon is evidence that these models  are getting better and they are not  going to stop since I learned about  natural language processing in 2016 I've  been testing out various models and  learning what inputs lead to what  outputs and I believe that that  understanding will be vital as these  models start to revolutionize the world  the idea of prompt engineering is pretty  simple at its core generative models  like Chachi BT analyze the text in a  prompt and determine what word or phrase  is most likely to come next if the  prompt is clear and specific the model  can accurately predict the next word  it's going to do an excellent job when  there is a pattern to follow and the  model can use the words and the format  in the prompt to anticipate the output  you are expecting however if the prompt  is unclear the model has to use its  existing knowledge to make an educated  guess admittedly Chachi PT has a lot of  knowledge because it was trained on  right around 40 billion words while that  much information can sometimes result in  accurate predictions it can also lead to  errors when relying on existing  knowledge the model might generate  results that are biased in some way or  inaccurate because that's how it was in  the training data and in the case of  mid-journey Chachi PT was trained in  2021 so mid-journey documentation didn't  even exist to train on prompt  engineering is all about Bridging the  Gap between what a model would generate  by default and what you actually want  the output to be by providing the model  with the information it needs to  generate what you want you can combine  the strength of modern processing power  with the Ingenuity of your own Humanity  large language models are logical enough  that when you teach it something with a  clear explanation it will learn that  thing and if you show it a format you  like the model will follow it so what I  have done for this video is explain the  concept of coming up with mid-journey  prompts and showed it that concept as  well as the format those prompts come in  all with one simple beautiful prompt so  now all you gotta do  is paste in my secret prompt boom  and click Send  I asked it to create prefer options for  Epic Fantasy Landscapes it creates three  suffix here one for Ariel  uh another one  another one for Kingdom  and the last one for natural I'm using  chat GPT plus here so this goes a little  faster for me than it might if you're  using this for free but chat gbt is free  and anyone can use it so you can  absolutely do this too let's take a  quick look at these Generations it gave  me a heading it explained what the  prompt was for as a little bit of AD  copy this is something I asked for and  then afterward it gave me a code block  with a prefer option set command in it  it looks pretty good at first glance all  of these seem pretty correct but of  course first glance is not what we're  looking for when we're looking for AI  art we want to see if they're actually  going to work probably the first test  that we have to do is see if they paste  into mid-journey so let's click copy  let's go over to mid-journey and paste  looks pretty good I'm going to click  this on the top and it all fills itself  out so prefer option set aerial Epic  Fantasy landscape click enter  and ta-da our custom option has been set  we're going to do the same thing with  Kingdom  beautiful  and lastly we're gonna go and do that  for natural  so now we have three prefer options of  course the next thing we want to know is  if they generate impressive looking art  let's paste in part two of my secret  little prompt here  go back into chat gbt click paste and  send beautiful sure here are five  imagine commands for generating artworks  based on the Styles you specified aerial  Kingdom and natural incorporating the  idea of fractals just like I asked for  this is something I did in my special  note it generates three four five  commands and these look pretty cool I  don't know how they're gonna turn out so  let's copy the first one paste it into  mid Journey see it does it look like an  imagine command click that click paste  or click enter and a city a floating  city with fractal Skyline soaring  airships and Epic Adventures  that looks pretty good we're gonna do it  again four more times paste these into  mid journey and then I'm gonna come back  when they're all generated so I can show  them to you don't these look fantastic  the aerial mode and these floating  islands look great the fractal castles  where the spiers get smaller but it just  gets taller and all at the same time  beautiful creation and of course I  didn't do any of the prompt engineering  for this it was all chat GPT we continue  to look at the nature scenes I just want  to go on a quest and explore those it's  fantastic  again with the aerial just spectacular  and this kingdom is absolutely great  that bottom right one with the glowing  crystal in the window  beautiful  and of course once you've done that in  Chachi BT you are absolutely free to  start creating even more in exact  specifications as you want because it  learned what you wanted I could ask it  to  create a prefer options suffix for cute  cartoon animals  click Send and it knows exactly what I'm  asking for  I could copy the code paste it into  mid-journey and if I don't want to call  it cute cartoon I can absolutely change  it but let's just leave it for now it  pastes beautifully and now create five  slash imagine  commands for that new  suffix  it's going to create a cartoon fox for  me paste the fox  it's going to create a cartoon panda for  me  Pace the panda  it's going to create a cartoon elephant  for me Pace the elephant and it's faster  than I am as I keep going pasting  Hedgehog and all of these it's gonna do  some incredible things and it's still in  wallpaper mode because that's what I  told it originally but if I wanted a new  uh aspect ratio I could just ask for it  because I've taught it what the aspect  ratio means rather than just what this  format is  while all of these generate these  beautiful beautiful cartoons I bet  you're ready to revolutionize your AI  art game well it is my pleasure to  announce a brand new way for you to  support the channel and get this prompt  at the same time if you go to  patreon.com hitting the like button  I bet I got some of you yeah so hit like  for the YouTube algorithm and here is  the prompt  I'm also going to put it in paste spin  just like I did in my last video  absolutely free for anyone who wants to  try it if we just look through these you  see I've given examples for what the  prompt should look like what the format  is examples for the prefer option suffix  and then I  basically told it what I want you could  just change this last line and get get  the suffixes that you are actually  looking for next  once those are generated I just I had  another little prompt here which  explained how to create slash imagine  commands it goes into what your scene is  with trades lighting mood and worked  specifically for Landscapes you might  need to reformat it a little bit if  you're doing something else but again  this is teaching the AI how to create  slash imagine commands so that it can do  it itself and afterwards you can do  absolutely anything with these commands  and I truly believe the sky is the limit  but if you're still not sure how these  prompts work and why you might use a  slash refer option in the first place I  absolutely recommend you check out this  video right now  I'll see you there
