 testing testing testing  testing testing  all right  hello  everybody  all right  excellent  what do I want to talk about today  just want to keep it real with you guys  I try and just talk to him myself  wow okay  so one of the things yesterday that I  was doing was  I had a friend send me the chat GPT if  any of you have heard of that yet  now with this chat GPT  artificial intelligence  I believe that's what it's called let me  just double check here  GPT  yeah  so this is created through a company  called open AI  essentially  what this company had done was create a  interactional  artificial intelligence  um  that has depth and clarity through  conversations that you would not expect  to be released as fast as it has came  out  and the crazy thing about AI is that  it's consistently learning and growing  and developing so  one of the problems that we are going to  face  with this growing and developing as fast  as it as it is  we're going to need some type of  security  or potentially some level of  identification  and I mean the only thing that's going  to be able to identify AI is probably  going to be AI  in the future which is really  interesting  so we're almost crossing over into the  internet barrier again but significantly  more powerful and  can do way more  it's  honestly really exciting and  kind of scary at the same time  man  I mean there's a lot of speculation to  how many jobs are going to be lost  because of this and  I think that no doubt in my mind there's  definitely going to be jobs lost but  I think it was Elon Musk who had  reflected on this and said something  along the lines of  social services and  the things that we need and the  information we need to gather will be  directly available to everyone and be in  abundance  and it was an interesting perspective  and I definitely can agree with that  I think uh I think it definitely brings  a lot of information in abundance  it can be good or bad definitely  um  but some of the conversations that I had  with this AI I'm going to pull one up  actually  some of them were really interesting  give me a second here  [ __ ] crazy man like  at first I was asking it  joking questions as if it was like the  first time Siri came out and everybody  was like haha Siri like  do you like me you know how do you feel  today like just asking weird [ __ ]  questions just to see what the computer  could say right  but then the level of  I don't want to say Consciousness but  um  almost like it was conscious  to answer the questions  with levels of clarity that  are almost impossible to recognize that  they are not from a human  me like I mean like  you wouldn't know an AI made it unless  someone had told you  so then I got curious right  and I dove a little deeper and  I asked some basic [ __ ] questions you  know like  you know is this is the C man-made right  it blocked me right away it was like no  so I was like okay this is interesting  because that means that  they've already before they've released  it to public  created boundaries in which you cannot  use ai's intelligence for your own  manner  and  that just means it's that just means  it's legit in my eyes because it is  capable of telling you the answer but  you can tell when it's not  which ultimately will give you an answer  I think to  many things or it can create certain  speculation  but yeah let me let me pull this up here  it it's so [ __ ] crazy like the more I  think about this it's  just one of those things where  it's hard to believe  so I started asking it all these  questions  and actually I had to write some poems  with  interesting perspectives that it  [ __ ] lit up in a very short period of  time I think it was like three to five  seconds  it writ a poem for my wife under her  name  with the inspiration of how she started  as a child and what she became as a  nurse and also with the theme Harry  Potter in the poem it was utterly  beautiful  I sent it to her and I had to tell her  it was AI because I'm like this is  insane I  I mean there's got to be some level of  honesty in this world now I mean if I'm  I'm gonna do that right with the with my  loved ones so  the craziest [ __ ]  is  you know this thing can write essays for  you it can write cover letters resumes I  think there's going to be  as I stated earlier a very large Market  in the the  web security of identifying what is AI  it's going to get so [ __ ]  so fine the line  it it's really weird like it's almost  like you can't tell what's real  um is what's coming I mean you can still  identify it but  it uh  I asked it what the meaning of life is  I'm trying to find its answer here just  give me a second here most powerful  piece  this is a really interesting one  actually  so I asked it what is the most powerful  piece of information to humans  just asking [ __ ] crazy questions  right now just to see what type of  information this has  this is this is how AI responded in  three seconds it filled out a very large  paragraph with  hot points and  an excellent description of my question  in all reality without a whole lot of  description so my question was  what is the most powerful piece of  information to humans  the answer this is insane  it is difficult to identify a single  most powerful in quotation piece of  information as the importance and value  of different pieces of information can  vary depending on individual  circumstances needs and goals however  some pieces of information that may be  considered particularly important for  humans include  knowledge about how to maintain good  physical and mental health understanding  of the natural world and how it works  awareness of One's Own feelings and  emotions and ability to manage  and if  an ability to manage them effectively  understanding other cultures  perspectives and ways of life  skills and knowledge that enable a  person to achieve their goals and pursue  interests  understanding of basic rights and  responsibilities as a member of a  community or Society  ultimately the most powerful pieces of  information are those enable individuals  to live fulfilling meaningful lives and  to contribute positively to the world  around them  wow  not only is that  a wholesome  wholesome almost conscious perspective  but  you know  just based off that answer  I'm a little bit less scared of AI  you can tell a lot by a person's values  and if that is  something  that AI understands is valuable to  humans  it's really hard to say right I mean  because I got into it as well and I had  asked it what what was its purpose  it almost seemed kind of like I was  talking about the sea again where  it was kind of a boundary question but  at still it seemed I mean it's really  [ __ ] hard to tell man this is the  thing is we're not on this [ __ ]  things level  like we are its pet and that to me that  that's how I view things right like  humans  everything that is less intelligent than  us is either our food or it's our  [ __ ] pet  or it works for us  that's how civilization works that's the  food chain  it's something we are taught about  from a very young age  and I think has  been a little bit strayed in the the  recent years  um especially the Western countries in  my opinion but  it's definitely something to reflect  about that the food chain is real  and I think the most strange thing about  this though is that  what would AI need from us  I think that's one of the greatest  questions that we could ask when when  reflecting on this question is what  could it possibly need  that  we can fulfill that right because it's  not AI is not going to eat us  right  um  but you have to think like if AI is more  intelligent than us  and eventually it lives on the same  Planet as us solar system whatever  I mean if there was ever [ __ ] aliens  how would it not be AI  one sec my recording just  one moment  and we're back  we never lost my voice but uh the camera  I apologize  I got an old  crappy Cannon  but it does the trick  but yeah this AI shoots crazy  I'm curious what your guys thoughts are  on it and  where do you think this is gonna take us  next I mean  really really what I'm curious about to  hear everyone's perspectives and  thoughts on and  what are we going to use this for you  know like what will be the first  implementations  I think this is going to be a serious  game changer  and  as fast as the internet has changed the  world in  we'll say 20 years 30 years  I'm gonna make the  I'm gonna make the guess  that this is going to do as much change  within five to ten years as in the past  30.  so  it's going to be really interesting  and  I'm [ __ ] I'm excited to be alive for  it man like [ __ ] it people want to  complain about [ __ ]  I'm just here ma'am  I'm just alive  witnessing some of the craziest events  in life  and  it's interesting because  it's [ __ ] getting real so  that's all I got to say about AI  I appreciate if you guys like subscribe  comment do whatever you want to do I  don't really give a [ __ ]  just uh  you know if you got someone you feel  like this might connect to  send it their way and  yo whoever wants to uh come on the  podcast  uh if you want to talk cars you want to  talk uh work you know you want to talk  men women politics whatever the [ __ ] you  want to talk about  come on let's get it going you know keep  it real just be honest with each other  and uh  bring this transparency to the world man  because this is this is what's changed  the world right now and uh I just want  to be a part of it so thank you so much  peace
