 again let me welcome you all to the  Future Trends Forum I'm delighted to see  you all here today we have an incredibly  important topic of a great number of  people with a lot of ideas and I'm  really looking forward to our  conversation for a few weeks now the  world has been convulsed with chat GPT  people been trying it out people been  asking it questions we've been thinking  about it trying to figure out what it  means and the answers to what it means  are all over the place people think it  may be the apocalypse or higher  education that may kill writing as we  know it and Allied to AI Technologies  and other fields like music and visuals  it may mean the end of human creativity  another extreme says that it's actually  not a big deal but it's not very good  it's easily controllable and we can just  basically absorb it into our normal  educational activities others see all  kinds of angles and challenges what does  cause copyright apply to it what does it  mean to write something like that what  does it do to the human voice what are  the many pedagogical responses what are  the institutional responses what does  this mean for Google search Enterprise  and more now last week we had a  conversation about this that was a rip  roaring hour this non-stop question and  we have questions left over from it in  fact we had a whole bunch of ideas and  the topic is so good we're returning to  it right now now what I'd like to do for  the next right now next hour of  conversation is I'd like to invite you  to share your comments and thoughts and  I'm going to bring it to the stage  people who are invested in this people  who are expert in different parts who  computer science to media studies to  writing pedagogy to economics and I'd  like to have a conversation rolling  about that so if you'd like to join us  on stage again just press the raised  hand button easy to bring you right up  if you have questions or comments please  just use the Q a box and we're happy to  host you  um in fact before I can say anything  already hands have gone up and questions  have gone up and I have to follow a long  tradition the future transform which is  to bring up on stage somebody  who has a good beard so without uh any  any hesitation hello Barry Burkett  hey guys how's everyone doing this  morning all right good afternoon now  well if it's morning you must be in the  midwest or the West somewhere I'm right  outside of Cincinnati Ohio I'm on the  Kentucky side of the Ohio River yeah  okay are you are you being scoured by  wind are you being fledged by snow and  ice well we've been getting some some  more gray weather this morning it's  supposed to be wet tonight and then it's  supposed to be freezing overnight into  those negative digits we've all been  seeing inside  news reports recently load up on  supplies and be safe absolutely thank  you absolutely so what do you think  Barry what's your take on Chachi PT you  have an unusual perspective yeah so I  think the chat GPT so to everybody my  name is Barry I'm the CEO and co-founder  of a startup called sakane  um our first product we are working to  stop ghost writing inside of Academia  and so that's my perception of it my  perception of it is that chat GPT  is no different  or can be no different than somebody  using an essay Mill it's just we've just  used AI to help to help stop that so  that is my central point of view and so  in that I think that that that AI can be  doing two things right similar to what  people were saying last week it can be  like a calculator that can really help  you know if you can really disrupt a  student's education when learning their  match packs and deploying their math  facts in the class but it can also be  one of these things that can kind of  take the first pass at something and  help somebody understand their argument  better they can then improve upon as  they want to be improving upon their  writing  um and I think that comes down to the  creativity of the administration and the  instructor and to be developing that  that relationship right with the  students because one of the central  arguments of catching ghost writers is  that is that you need to be looking at  how students communicate with you  anyways and then compare that to what  they're submitting and see how those two  things work together  interesting point  um so for you this is this is you're the  opposite of the apocalyptic school of  thought  um you're saying this is something that  we already know how to control and to  handle pre-effectively  I I think well so so research right so  so again my benefit in academic  Integrity my Bend is in stopping ghost  writing right a lot of research has been  saying that the best thing to do is to  be interviewing your students right for  your instructors to be cross-questioning  a student I forget who I I forget who  the gentleman was on that you had last  week who who taught writing to his  classes he's like you know in theory  everybody has a class of 15 students and  if I had a class of 15 students I could  teach everybody in that class how to be  writing it'd be fine but I've not had  that my lowest class has been 65  students whoa well that was that was one  of the panelists that you had last week  yeah right so so I mean 60 that was the  lowest class he had in upwards of 125.  if you have one structure even one  instructor with a TA population able to  assist that becomes a very burdensome  task to be cross-questioning each  student about what they wrote before you  even get into grading their writing  ability and talking about their  semantics and stuff  and so that was the lift that that we  saw we wanted to follow that line of of  research saying let's get more crops  questioning and talking with our  students more we felt that that was more  appropriate with that academic honesty  and integrity statement like that the  trust that we try and give like you the  student are going to give me your best  and me the scholar I'm going to give you  my best we wanted that collaborative  relationship  um and we felt that things like style of  metrics well well we've seen that silent  metrics are not panning out that use of  judging metadata  um it's not been I think we're  continuing to see iterations on that and  then then there are also  um there's some really cool technologies  that are being developed where people  are able to use add-ons inside of  Microsoft Word to be able to see when  students work how they work where  they're working from that kind of stuff  which  blends the dynamic between okay I don't  have a camera in front of you but it's  still a little bit big brother of saying  is this your IP address how long have  you been working on this one so partly  it's a technological answer but it's  also partly about improving the  relationship between instructor and  students 100 yes that that would be my  point of view  Barry can I keep you on stage for a few  minutes sure because we have a whole  horde of people and I want to I want to  join the I want I know and you know  those who are not white guys with beards  I think are fully welcome so let me get  as many of them as possible  um oops hang on a second  so let me welcome uh Carolyn coward who  has one of the best jobs in the United  States a librarian at JPL hello Carolyn  how's my sound Brian it's pretty good  your your video your video looks a  little choppy but uh we can see you and  we can hear well such is my life lately  um thank you for inviting me up I really  appreciate it um I'm I would like to add  to this conversation I'd like to dial  this back a couple of layers and I  apologize I was not on  last week but I'd like to talk about the  AI systems themselves  um I'm involved with the NASA effort to  establish guidelines practice and  eventually policy around ethical and  responsible AI  and what that means to NASA is we we  delineate ethical versus responsible  ethical has to do with the actual  wrenching under the hood the actual  systems development is there inherent  bias in the system is there junk code or  programming we want to make sure that  the systems we develop are the highest  possible quality with the least amount  of bias so that as the AI starts  learning from itself it doesn't drive  itself off the rails so that's ethical  AI responsible AI is a much broader  concept  where you took out look take a look at  uh the structure the people involved the  organization how ethical responsible uh  Equitable uh inclusive  how all of those factors for who is  building the system so responsible AI  takes a much more Global world view  about artificial intelligence  yeah some strange sounds in my ear oh it  was just a there's just a brief silence  you know like uh like okay I'm not a  robot I promise well we'll check today  anyway yeah that means we see anyway so  we're at Nasa we're working on both  ethical and responsible Ai and when  chatgpt came up I have to admit so I've  been a librarian for 30 years I've seen  all the technological developments from  the card catalog to opacs to databases  to we all remember zip disks uh to what  we have yeah the beginnings of the  internet basic HTML Web 2.0 web 3.0 so  I've seen all the changes and I love all  the changes but  the fact is I'm actually a bit of a  Luddite I'm a bit of a like a skeptic  I'm looking at AI with a real kind of a  jaundiced eye and I'm wait and see  attitude  heck we just bought a new microwave oven  two weeks ago and I got nervous because  it didn't have a keypad on it it's got  this slidey thing and I'm still kind of  getting used to that so I look at  technology in general as okay let's wait  and see let's see if this is good for  the library environment with connecting  uh information with the people that need  it  um I also spent 20 years in higher  education so I have a lot of experience  with a lot of people are familiar with  hips high impact educational practices  so I'm listening to the chat GPT  conversation here and I'm thinking there  needs to be an ethical Foundation uh to  all of the systems that we work with and  plea I haven't looked into chat GPT that  deeply I'm looking at the conversation  around it and I'm listening to  the dialogue I'm listening to the  concern I'm listening to the concern  specifically about how will students use  it how can faculty use it how can  administrators use it in general and I'm  thinking okay let's do a deep dive into  the company let's do a deep dive into  the system have they opened their their  system for examination or is it a black  box a proprietary system  um so these are all questions that I'm  kind of formatting in my mind also the  whole will students use this to  plagiarize papers and not do the work of  course they will of course they of  course they will they're you know the  traditional age 18 to 24 years old  they're busy they don't they see it at  taking classes in general as a means to  an end they just want the grade they  want to get out they don't most of them  and I'm making a big generalization most  of them don't see the nuanced benefit to  a broadly based undergraduate education  as we do who are old stirs and have been  through the mill even graduate students  are they're working full-time if they're  gas they're not making a whole lot of  money so yeah absolutely we need to pay  attention to this but high high impact  practices uh smaller classes as Barry  mentioned we need to kind of Pare this  down in if there's any way we can  connect with our students one-on-one or  or small group on one and make that kind  of impact I think that will have an  effect on you know showing the students  the benefit of doing their own research  so I'm here to advocate for ethical AI  responsible Ai and to really kind of I  mean I'm not in the dive in yes this is  great I'm not in the the apocalyptic I'm  kind of let's see how this turns out is  that my concern though Doug just and  I'll wrap it up because I know them  there's other people want to speak my  one concern  is that the general public  is cottoning to this and feeding all  kinds of personal information into this  one system and with any kind of fad any  kind of trend online social media that  you know the word spreads like wildfire  people really aren't thinking about hmm  how are they using my data  a on the other side are they am I being  monetized well of course we're being  monetized you know come on uh but how  else are they using my data and is that  an area of concern so I have not even  tried chat GPT because I don't want them  to have access to my data even typing in  a question chat GPT what do you what you  know what color is the sky is it blue of  course it's blue well that that  establishes a connection between me and  the system so these are all questions I  think need to be posed to the chat GPT  company but in for higher education as a  whole end of rant thank you Brian that's  not around Carolyn that's a whole series  of great points thank you thank you for  sharing them well by the way going or  aiming to hold the session about Ai and  libraries within a month or two  um all right let me let me keep you both  on stage here and I want to add another  person this is my friend and colleague  Lee scalar of Bessette and let me see if  uh if I can beam her in  hello Lee  hey how you doing good good to see you  are you at home  yeah I'm in my dark basement  excellent excellent well it's good to  see you good to see you stay warm there  oh yeah actually it's nice and warm it's  raining  yeah I'm still warm and dry then how is  uh how what are your thoughts about  Chachi Pitino what are you thinking oh  by the way before you say anything in  the chat uh there's a link to uh leaves  a Tarot uh list or zotero page which has  a ton of links there so I commend you to  that and thank you yeah and feel free as  I said it's a public group and so you  can join the group you can add resources  to it  um had a lot of uh as I said DH people  add some contextualization around  conversations we've been having around  at the digital humanistic been having  around Ai and AI written texts  um for over a decade uh if not more  um that we've that that uh that that's  going on but I think and and I want to  Echo and give credit also I don't know  if Karen's here today but Karen Costas  was bringing up some of these issues in  the chat last week that I think are  really important around  um you know unintended consequences  um but also ways that it can help uh  traditionally marginalized communities  but also how might it be used to Target  I'm thinking particularly of second  language learners  where it can help them produce more  fluent texts in English  where they may understand the concepts  they may be able to know them very well  but they are typically penalized for  writing or even speaking  um in a non-standard English and even  English speakers from different regions  and different  and from different cultural backgrounds  uh have traditionally been penalized  when we talk about quote unquote  Standard English and what should be  written and what is considered  University and so  um this could be a tool to really help  these students communicate in a more  quote unquote acceptable level of  English where they are communicating  their knowledge in a way that is  approved but in the same time that could  be a way of penalizing them and saying I  know you can't write English this well  because English is not your first  language and we've seen that we've seen  that generally we've seen uh you know  we've seen that kind of accusation  before chat GPT where uh certain  International students or students of  different cultural backgrounds English  second language students have been  targeted  um and and accused of cheating or paying  essay meals because there's no way your  English could be that good  um so it can be it could be both a tool  to really be able to help and overcome  some of these biases that the students  have no control over but could also be a  way of reinforcing those biases  another another thing to think about is  the disability community  um those who are neurodivergence  um those who have other kinds of  disabilities like how could we you know  I think caught or lost in the moral  Panic is again not not just how these  tools could be useful to general student  population but to other as I said to  traditionally marginalized student  populations such as the among others the  disability community so how could this  start so like I have ADHD and  um one of the things about ADHD is  um being unable to start  right and so could chat GPT be a good  tool to help those people with ADHD who  have trouble you know you say write a  paper and they need steps right you need  steps to be able to do that and not  often or not always are those prompts  given the steps and so you could turn to  something like chat GPT to get you  started  um and you eventually write the whole  paper but you just need that little bit  of extra help  um that you can't quite articulate and  that again that's just an example  um in this particular case but you know  there's  there are ways that this tool can bring  a tremendous amount of good  um you know and I agree with the whole  privacy and all of that because that  could also mean tremendous harm to  typically historically surveilled over  surveilled populations  um but you know if we can find a way to  do it ethically  could this tool be used as as a as a  good for again not just for all students  but particular students who have  typically been marginalized and or  struggled uh within within the higher  education setting  good good observations really good  observations Lee thank you thank you so  much I really like your balanced  approach of this uh targeting people for  good or for ill  um I I'd like to just uh quickly bring  in one question that was raised uh and I  want let's see three of you want to  touch on this this is from our friend uh  Hussain hamam who's out in Beirut and he  couldn't make it live today but he was  really curious about uh the business  case of of chat GPT and he was really  curious to see among other things what  it would do to the Google advertising  Market as well as to advertising in  general thinking about what happens if  you can simply direct chat GPT to write  you some ad copy I'm just wondering what  some of your thoughts are on that  yeah please very good  uh you're still muted I'm sorry I muted  myself to be polite and I'm going to  figure out how to unmute myself it's  okay so so as far as the use case for  copy like like that's there that that's  happening that that ship has passed  right if you follow there's there's  several Twitter feeds that people have  been talking about and over the summer  there was this this article that got  written  um about a researcher in  I want to say Denmark uh maybe Sweden  and she she had a GP a chat a GPT  right about itself and then post it to  peer-reviewed journals right and with  them as the first name and her as the  second name and have permission of her  you know PhD leader and it got accepted  into two  right what with with don't really know  like it got accepted right so so I know  I talked about two different things here  but um I think that this idea of  purchasing time in open AI like I think  that's inside of the AUP which speaks to  um you know very much what Caroline what  you were talking about as far as like  you know putting your information in and  what do you get out which some people  have that issue with plagiarism Checkers  right because you are giving over your  intellectual property to have your  information checked you're giving over  your intellectual property  even when you ask a question and  sometimes it's the question that's more  potent  than the answer  right and so so what we don't know right  it's very similar to Facebook at the  beginning we all got on Facebook hell  yeah this is great let's talk and we  didn't know what metadata was we didn't  know what Micro Data was we didn't know  what happened in Cambridge analytica  came out and we're like oh  now I don't want to you know Caroline I  very much have that have that same  thought that you do of like where do I  want to put my stuff in but let me tell  you when you're starting a startup you  have to put yourself everywhere so like  my stuff  I tried cleaning myself up and then it's  like man I gotta be here all right so  you can't back out you can't get out  once you're in you're everywhere I've  been using a hashtag on my social media  don't feed the AI Beast  and the AI Beast is insatiable the AI  Beast may seem friendly but it may be  deadly we don't we thing is we just  don't know and part of the difficulty  and part of the reason we're having this  conversation is that we're all kind of  smart and a little bit skeptical and we  can kind of see around corners and we're  kind of imagining a future a rather  dystopian future unfortunately where  this stuff is like I said monetized  without our consent or our knowledge  used against us and formulating a world  as an information professional I realize  the change  how people search for consume and digest  information and share information from  let's say 1995 to now back in 1995  people were more likely to consult print  materials Because the Internet was still  kind of in its infancy  um they were more likely to trust  experts they were more likely to share  information that they have vetted with  their trusted experts now in the era of  this magic box and I'm looking at a  screen it's kind of the great equalizer  but that's a double-edged sword it's a  great equalizer because everybody has  information access  globally but the quality of the  information we have access to all kinds  of garbage information this is the other  concern I mean what as Educators we're  trying to guide our students  to the best quality information using  the best quality resources you know  showing them how to format and how to  cite sources accurately but if those  sources themselves are questionable but  don't look questionable the student is  caught is really caught in the middle so  how do we as Educators guide our  students to not only cite sources and do  the whole sort of information literacy  the usual but also to judge those  sources to track back where is the  content coming from because sometimes  it's impossible to know where that  content is coming from that's another  big concern of mine oh that really is  and that's that's quite I mean the two  of you have offered too hang on secondly  just quickly you've offered two very  very different responses the uh uh I  mean Barry your responses well it's it's  too late the barn door is out the horses  in the next County  um we've got to cope with this and  Carolyn yours is more prophylactic you  want us to not touch the thing  um not not touch it but play with it  gently if I could extend the metaphor a  little bit know what we're getting into  know that they're well that there are a  lot of unknowns and have that be kind of  okay but realize that they're you know  very polarizing and like I said I'm  looking at this with a bit of a  jaundiced eye a bit of a Skeptics stance  and and really kind of hanging back to  see where the conversation is going  waiting also for the for all the heat to  die down on social media people are like  oh this is the best thing since let's  just play with this and see okay y'all  play with it enjoy  let's see where it goes I'm going to  give it three months and then then we'll  we can kind of have a more nuanced  conversation about chat GPT well that's  a long time good advice good thoughts uh  lee please chime in yeah I mean yes oh  I'm sorry uh we please you go ahead go  and my the the Confluence there is that  I also go by Lee in my Daily Show  I feel like John Jacob Jingleheimer  Schmidt in this one we're leaving my  name too so with my apology  what are the chances AI driven no stop  that no no no uh no I I think that  there's I think that there is  um a new there is the Nuance to this  where but I think  um who was it John Warner said it and he  said if we teach writing like an  algorithm and then I sort of added the  fact the algorithm will always do it  better  right if we're writing ad copy and it's  formulaic the machine will do it better  and more efficiently right yeah I had it  right and about me and it was completely  wrong and it's about me but it followed  the formula of what an about me should  sound like right and so this is where  you know and I it's probably we we've  likened it to a calculator but I would  almost go as far as saying it's almost  like a spreadsheet  right where you know we don't miss the  fact that we don't do those calculations  anymore right we set up the spreadsheet  it does it for us right I don't have to  sit there with my grade book yeah I mean  there's more transparency we kind of  understand well some people do some  people think it's Auto Magic I'm I I I  hate spreadsheets so I think that  they're like you know evil  um but but again you know I don't have  to manually calculate my grade book  anymore  I am happy to pass that off to a machine  yes  um  you know as somebody who writes and who  writes a lot and one of the reasons why  people hire me is because I write a lot  very well very quickly and efficiently  but the machine will always do it better  than me  so you know I think in terms of things  that follow a certain formula right and  so then it is what is the value add that  we bring to it if we are creatives in  the field of writing  you know and that's I think that that  goes for school but I think for things  that are you know very formulaic  right it it'll get it  mostly right and I mean our ads are  served up algorithmically now anyways  I'm gonna I'm gonna call Barry Lee too  and I know what Lee two is about to say  when you say it will always do it better  and I heard him I saw him go  yeah  but but again like it's it's you know  we've all seen those weird algorithm ads  that it's just like it knows you know  again it's learned from what your  metadata is posted so it's going to make  a t-shirt about you being a swim coach  Mom what actually also does ballet and  pilates right like the mismatch to get  you know get your own sweatshirt or you  know any of these other ads that are  just like take their name take their  this take their that it's like Mad Libs  right if our advertising copies already  like Mad Libs anyways well then this  more sophisticated version of Mad Libs  is gonna probably do it better right so  you know what I'm I you know in terms of  you know I think of its uses outside of  higher education  as you know I think that cat's out of  the bag I think for us within higher  education in terms of the people who  study it with the people who are  thinking about this things like  intellectual property stuff like that I  think it's important for us to take that  more cautious approach but I also agree  that I think outside of higher education  where it's like I could pay somebody to  write copy or I could pay somebody less  just to like scan over the copy chat GPT  makes  you know like capitalism is going to win  out every time  just to kind of summarize in Lee one if  I could if I could if I could summarize  if I'm looking if I'm looking for AI to  help me find a recipe for broccoli  cheese soup  I'm all over it yeah just you know I I  put in how many people what kind of  cheese how fresh is the broccoli done I  I have a but I don't want my AI  chastising me saying oh you're eating  too much cheese this week wouldn't you  just rather have broccoli soup I'm like  no  so sorry and but some people do you know  some people you know like that that's  the nudging those are the the micro you  know the micro moves they want nudging I  mean and that's something in higher  education too right where we have the  kind of automated reminders the  automated reach outs the automated and  if chat GPT I saw in in this chat  somebody was talking about that  um where would chat GPT be something  good to help coach students  right and so like there's there's the  both of that sorry go go ahead brotherly  yeah so so what Lee two has to say about  that is  um you know from my background so before  I got into instruct before I got here  and I was an instructional designer at a  university but before that several lives  ago I worked in adult education helping  adults get their geds and go to college  or you know hit their goals right and a  big powerful thing inside that is what  we call modeling I think everybody here  knows what modeling is right you show  people what's there  I think that one of the powerful  features that chat GPT has is that  you're able to say hey I need this and  it starts building it  and you're able to see how those things  go together and one of the things that  can be interesting from a writing 101  point of view is like how do you  construct these things why are the why  did why did the AI choose these things  as a paragraphs right now that's as a  learning tool now Lee Prime what I would  say to your comment about it being  you know formulaic it's 100 formulate  I'm not saying that it's good right but  if you could have a if you can have  somebody who's witty a copywriter trying  to get those one sentence statements and  they're just you know they're having a  riffing but it's not quite getting where  they're going and they say hey AI I want  50 statements and then it starts seeing  how the AI starts ripping with it and  they're able to take that and platform  to the next space it's no different than  what was it at free schools in Australia  several years ago maybe 10 years ago  there was the guy who who led that  course on um cheating and basically the  students were not allowed to have an  original thought in the course so  everything they had to do had to be beg  hard or stealed but then stolen but then  cited where it came from  you know so I think that that that  sterned a lot of creativity that  students didn't realize what what  cheating was but but to go back like I  think that that AI can be that tool that  can help  unstick people I think it can assist ESL  writers I think it can assist early  Learners the question is like what the  instructor wants  if the instructor wants a Ghostwriter  right there's nothing wrong with ghost  writing presidents have done it for eons  right nothing wrong with ghost writing  the question is what do you want in your  class and I think the last time we're  talking about the growth that people  have with the internal struggle that you  have right this this building inside of  your scheme of what makes good writing  of what you're trying to say and it's  that internal argument that helps you  refine what you're trying to say and  that's the that's the important part of  writing  right and so that's the value that we're  trying to get so one of my questions is  with AI taking this first pass  what will that evaluation then become do  we still argue with the AI or do we look  at it like  a sixth grader with a calculator that  the calculator is always right even  though it's garbage any garbage out  it's great uh I I love the original  question and how you all wandered far  away from it  um the uh uh but each of you hit really  really important points in the in the  chat there have been a whole bunch of  responses including the fact that you  guys are emphasizing process rather than  product and as well as the the important  difference in human creativity and voice  um and I this is this is key I want to  add one more person to the mix uh this  is uh someone who's coming to us from uh  an extreme time zone uh compared to us  which is uh Brent Anders who is at the  American University of Armenia and was a  great panelist last week uh and let's  see if Brent is up hello sir hello  yeah so there's a couple of things  um One to begin with I I think we we  really have to understand certain things  um like the fact that an AI system that  can do a whole lot of what chat GPT is  doing right now has been around it's  been around for at least two years so  our students have known this and they've  been using it so this isn't a fad that's  going to go away it's not a temporary  thing in fact there's lots of rumors  talking about hey within a few months  maybe even before the summertime  gpt4 will come out now GPT 4 has the  potential to be anywhere from 100 to 500  times more powerful and more capable  than what chat GPT is currently using  right so look at sync in as far as the  capabilities and the the what that  actually means so what's really  interesting though is that when we use  the system yeah for sure it's formulaic  I ask it to create a an essay about  democracy  for sure it's going to use you know  basically five paragraphs and here you  go uh but then the coolness of the and  the power of it is then I can tell chat  GPT hey I like what you did there but uh  change this give me another version make  it uh more emotional make it uh in this  way make it the way uh Albert Einstein  would would say it make it the way uh  this other person would say it and it'll  modify it as many times as you want  so that kind of brings me into this next  part and this is what I'm struggling  with because I recently sort of thought  about our last session with chat GPT and  then I just thought about well what do  we say right now as far as plagiarism  within our policy at the University and  in there it talks specifically about oh  it's plagiarism if you're claiming  someone else's some other person's work  as your own  okay well there's a problem right there  right uh chat GPT or AI isn't a person  so basically according to the policy  that's not plagiarism but of course it  is right because it's someone some other  entities work but then that brings in  this other question right so here is  chat EPT  I let's say I create a document here's  my rough draft and my instructor looks  at it and says yeah you need to do these  things okay so I take that my rough  draft and I feed it into chat GPT and  then now I tell it hey give me feedback  and then I say okay Implement that  feedback  um change it so that it's more direct  because my instructor told me that so  now it's creating these other iterative  forms based off of my rough draft but  now is it still mine can I just claim me  should I say no it's co-authored by Chad  GPT really is it because what is  grammarly doing for us well grammarly  does quite a bit and if you get  grammarly premium which is using even  more AI in it as well it can paraphrase  an entire sentence for you so it's  creating another version of a sentence  for you so now is that AI do I need to  say oh grammarly also help me so you see  how it's really starting to get  this gray area is starting to really  grow as far as the ethical aspects of  what we're saying with you know who's  doing it and who has full ownership so  it becomes a really an interesting part  but one more thing one more thing is  that I really think that we have to  realize that this is our new reality and  if we're not incorporating these tools  and these capabilities into the  classroom we're going to be doing a  disservice to the students because you  go out into business you know you're  talking about copyright right now oh  yeah that's all done with AI and it's a  it's a factor of we still need to have  people to look at that that that that  content and to say oh that's good or  that's bad but the reality is now  instead of saying okay you have a week  to do this content  this copyright uh no you have a you have  a day to do it and you're going to need  to do 20 of them whereas before I'd give  you a week so now you have to use that  AI That's required of you you have to  have that skill and many many of the  different 21st century skills that are  being pushed are saying that hey if you  want to be competitive in the job market  you need to know how to properly work  with AI because that's just a new  reality I mean it's business absolutely  and may I I have a couple of comments  Brent you're brilliant that was amazing  that was that was just so cool  um so I dropped a big  theoretical conceptual Universal  question in the chat is chat is chat GPT  a tool or is it an entity because if we  are citing chat GPT or any other system  as a co-author or a primary author for  God's sake it becomes an entity on its  own and then in this era of digital  Twins and legal rights okay if chat GPT  becomes a primary author are they  entitled to compensation do we invite  them to a conference to speak uh you  know do we want to work I so I also work  a lot with open science and the various  flavors of open science and one emerging  sort of a 2.0 of open science is open  methods and so open methodology talks  about declaring how you're going to do  an experiment how you're going to do  your your science what your hypothesis  is  ahead of time before you publish and  part of that and it occurs to me that in  the area of disclosure we may see more  and more higher ed entities and other  organizations requiring that if you use  something like chat GPT you must  disclose that you use this I write I  wrote this paper with the chat GPT tool  system whatever entity so that people  will know that there is that flavor or  that support going on underneath  um so the other thing I wanted to to  mention  is that whether it's chat GPT or any  other tool the rate of change Brent you  mentioned version four is coming out in  just a couple months the rate of change  the rate of update the rate of  development has increased exponentially  so things are changing faster on a  technology level faster than any of us  can even comprehend let alone keep up  with and so that just adds to the  challenge of us sort of working in this  space and we continue to have  conversations like this because the new  version is going to come out and it's  going to have a Twist on things so we  didn't even expect so we also we this is  another reason why I'm kind of the Hang  back and be skeptical crowd is it's I  don't I can't formulate an opinion right  now because in 12 weeks it's going to be  completely different so I'd rather just  kind of take a breather and look at the  bigger picture thank you Brent that was  I love your parents yeah no I mean I I  want to do that too it's just it's going  to change so quickly that like one of  the big things that they're talking  about for 2023 is this idea that  everything is going to be super apps  right so that you're not going to have  so many different apps everything is  going to be put together uh even Google  right now is talking about how hey all  these different things that can go uh  you know text to to to image text to  video they're going to be incorporating  all those things so you're going to have  one system like a a Super Chat GPT where  you could tell it everything hey make me  a video about this make me uh images  about this and incorporate text and put  it all together in a website I mean  there's so many different things that  are going to be coming together uh that  is just going to be so phenomenal that  you know and I really like what you were  talking about as far as  having to to say well we use chat GPT  for this I think that that that is  something that in the interim will be  there but I I foresee a future very near  future where it's going to be what do  you mean what why are you telling us  that you did this of course you did it  like you have to say you'd have to say  no I didn't use it because it's already  yeah I mean exactly nobody here nobody  here is  being integrated with Microsoft Word as  well like why would Microsoft Word have  this in there already right if they want  to be competitive and they kind of do  already yeah oh it's a better Clippy  well I see you're writing a letter would  you like some help thank you it's a much  better clippy that we all hated back in  the day but now might actually be useful  but but I think that this this whole  idea as well and and this is you know so  there's writing classes and we want to  teach students how to write but mostly  how to communicate their thinking and  then I'm thinking of disciplinary  classes where the essay has typically  been the way that students have  communicated their thinking now there's  a move away from that in terms of  project-based learning in terms of all  different kinds of multimedia uh sorts  of things but but one of the things I  was thinking of is that I want to know  what basically as an instructor and  maybe people disagree is that I want to  know that you've learned the material  you've met the learning outcomes which  is typically you know whatever  discipline specific thing that they want  to that they that the students can  demonstrate they want students to  demonstrate that you can do X Y or Z or  understand or you know I'm I'm really  mask her in Bloom's taxonomy here but  give me a sec  so if tech GPT the way it is now and  maybe five will be better  um and I won't have to do as much  coaching but like you said at the moment  chat GPT takes a lot of coaching from  you it's like that's only five  paragraphs I need you to expand that  that you know you just made that up get  rid of that paragraph here read this  article on the topic and learn about it  and if I'm coaching chat GPT through the  process and I decide as the student this  now is you know I have to have an  understanding of the subject matter in  order to coach chat GPT to write a good  paper on that subject matter so am I not  meeting the learning outcome which is to  demonstrate knowledge  right and and I think that that's you  know I I think that that's something  that we don't think about either right  and it gets us thinking or how are we  assessing students why are we assessing  students the way they do why is the  essay particularly inhumanistic and even  social science disciplines the main way  um because again maybe this maybe this  point is moot in two iterations because  you don't have to coach it anymore but  at the moment that coaching reflects a  knowledge of the subject matter to be  able to say to it you know that's wrong  this is right you need to go deeper here  you know and it's not going to get a  better quote than that one yeah right  exactly when we talk about information  literacy like which skill are we now are  we going is that I can discern and maybe  I'm doing a better job than my you know  than my classmates who wrote their own  paper  you know you bring up a great point  because like so I'm in another country  right now Armenia and they're going  through a major shift in the development  of uh their educational process here  they're still very much focused on  students here because I have two  children that you know one's in high  school one's in middle school they're  very much focused on you have to  memorize information and then be able to  regurgitate it right that's exactly how  the United States was maybe 30 years ago  uh but there's still that and they're  still developing away from that because  it doesn't make any sense like we don't  need to memorize everything we have  Google for that we have all these  different what we need is critical  thinking to be able to actually use it  and then create content based off of  that but now it seems like we're moving  beyond that we don't have to create the  content we have to properly guide the  formation of it and understand that it's  being done in the right way so there's  this critical thinking that's still  going to be super important  um Barry I mentioned is it like raising  children  yeah exactly so I'm interested very in  what you have to say about this as far  as the detection software incorporating  that or looking at different aspects of  that  well so one of the things that  one of the reasons why I started this  startup is because our our tool is  working in a way that's different I I  feel that  um  that that plagiarism detection tools  that are on the market  um currently are are antagonistic I  don't believe that they value the  learner what the learner has that  they're working in a way of like a  gotcha way right even eproctor  so what we've done with our AI is is  different um my background is Adult Ed  so I think more than andragogical  process and I want to know what that  Learners bring to the table and so we're  working on creating something that is  more student first uh a concept that I  learned early on in talking with some  people at East Anglia university in  England  and what they were talking about is this  idea of like okay sure this is going to  Club this is going to stop ghost writing  um and that's but but how does this  benefit the student  so so we're working on that but but what  we see is our as our beginning is that  what we're asking is the students have  missed their paper like they would to a  turnitin submission  but then our AI is reading their paper  and asking them questions based off  their writing style their content and  their memory so it's not about like what  they've learned but it's about how they  wrote in their writing choices and we  feel that that is more accurate a more  accurate reflection of what we want to  get to right like like you can ghost  riding has happened for eons people  aren't worried about ghost writing right  now they're not I mean like ghost  writing any university has a ghost  writing issue Lee uh lee Prime would you  say that that you have instructors  asking a feeling like that ghost writing  is happening in their classroom  yeah I mean I mean they're they're  worried about it that's for sure  um you know and and you know we have we  have our honor Council we have I mean  cheating has been an issue at  universities  um you know since time immemorial right  like oh right I mean but I mean but  we've also changed our view of it  because we've gotten a lot more  sophisticated I mean I I you know I'm  I'm not that old and so but I can  remember you know pre-internet  um people talking about how there was a  filing cabinet in the Frat houses  that had everybody's papers  yeah now they're Dropbox folders I'm  sure but like that they you know that  there it was okay you have this  professor let's find our brother who  wrote in a paper for that class here it  is  right  um you know  this this has been around before the  Internet it's just we now have created  more sophisticated to use the term that  John used last week we've we've got way  more sophisticated cops yet  yeah  um while never addressing the actual  underlying issues  um that has led you know it's easier to  get the university to pay for cop [ __ ]  than it is to  um change the pedagogy and if I may  we're treating this as a whack-a-mole  game we keep chasing exactly we've got a  squash X technology we've got a squash X  plagiarism whatever we've got a squad  squash squash squash instead of  addressing the overarching issue of Why  students are doing this and what what is  feeding the motivation for them doing  this and do we need to maybe rethink  some of our own policies and our own  learning outcomes to really shape what's  going on in the classroom so that okay  we can stop playing whack-a-mole and get  to actual learning  yeah correct I mean but but that's also  the goal of writing right I mean like I  think all of us were inside of this  movement a way of the move away from  stage on the stage the guy on the side  you know how many times we've been  talking about rubrics but then rubrics  that are personalized so you're able to  then you know go into the system and  make it to this paper right and but all  of that that we've talked about I mean  all of that is formulaic isn't it I mean  how many times do we see a rubric that  is just you know four by four or five by  four well it's all from novice to to  whatever right it's like it's same same  but different right so so the question  is how do we make it more nuanced and  and I think that that's where we're  going  um I do want to go back to to a point  Brett that you were talking about is  this idea of like do we need to be  asking permission to be quoting the AI  and I think that that ship is right  about the station as well because  plagiarism is not the same thing as  ghost writing and that's which comes  back to my my central argument right  again looking at my tools it's like a  lot of a lot of schools have things in  place for plagiarisms  but a lot of schools do not have things  in place for when students are working  with essay Mills when students are using  that 50 bucks to their peer when  students are doing these other things  that's a lot more nuanced and a lot more  difficult and that's the issue that  that's happening here again if the  instructor wants it it doesn't matter  but the question is when are people  using it  and not getting that the background  information that's more relevant that  the instructor is wanting them to take  away to intervene here uh because you  guys are just brilliant  um this is great but I'm conscious of  time and that we only have four minutes  left  um I want to ask a couple of procedural  things uh first uh folks in the chat as  well as folks who have asked questions  uh in the chat in the question box do  you mind if I copy these and anonymize  these and post them to my blog just let  me know in the chat uh and I'll be I'll  be I'll be delighted to do that along  with the recording  um the uh there are a bunch of questions  uh that have that have been pouring in  and I'm trying to take one that I can  ask you all uh that will actually try to  uh sum things up  um and that is if you could  um right now if you could advise a  college or university  what to do about this either in  Carolyn's memorable phrase to whack that  mole or how to do this structurally what  would your advice be and I'd like to  give each of you about 45 seconds to uh  to to give a whack at that  um  mine will be super quick please go ahead  get rid of grades  so ungrading okay  right with ungrading the professor saws  to put something into  you know the the great book at the end  so so that doesn't look through that  problem good point and so and this goes  back  observation about the overarching issue  of what drives students to do this so  we'll just take away one of those  drivers right there thank you Lee Brown  I'd like to go next uh something that  I've seen actually quite helpful I don't  know if this will work with the big tier  one universities with thousands and  thousands of students but to actually  host a University Town Hall not just for  chat GPT but when these sticky problems  these sticky issues that we're grappling  with that directly affect students it  affects pedagogy it affects classroom  management all of that is to host a town  hall invite everybody and invite have an  open dialogue about okay here's the  latest issue whether it's covid or you  know back on campus or chat GPT or the  next thing  I'd like I'm always a fan of hearing  student voices about this I wanted I  would want to hear their concerns I  would want to hear their potential  Solutions and really take what they say  seriously and maybe incorporate that and  make some changes but at least have the  this conversation out in the open on an  Institutional level  I love this idea I love both of these  ideas and I'd be I'd be glad to help  host and and support those thank you  Carolyn so uh for my response I would  love for for for us to be at that level  right I'm stuck I also work as the  director for Center for teaching and  learning and I would love for our  instructors to be at that level of AI  literacy to even realize that this is  really going on right I can guarantee  you that a majority of your students  know about chat GPT or that they've  already been using some other of the  many AI creation uh software that's out  there to be creating writing already so  I would love to be able to push this and  say hey this is a mandated thing that  you need to know about that you need to  incorporate that you need to start to  push this understanding of AI Literacy  for both instructors and students  because this is the new reality so  pushing that having that be incorporated  in the overall process of doing things  so that the instructor knows that it  can't just be  thinking that oh this essay is going to  be my assessment well it doesn't really  assess anything if they're just using a  software to create it so there has to be  this more understanding of how we truly  gauging if the student is gaining all  the student learning outcomes that  they're supposed to within the course  brilliant thank you thank you and last  but not least Barry slash Lee secondary  yeah so I mean my response is that uh  you know early on the article that came  out in higher ed uh the the  the idea was just that listen to your  students know your students have that  Community right we're trying to build  community if you are on such a scale  that you that Community is not working  for you talking about these hard  concepts with your students then look at  the tools that can help  I feel that my tool auth plus is one of  those shifts  and I would like to be able to share  with anybody who's interested we're an  early stage startup we're trying to work  with teachers trying to work with  professors anybody that wants to enable  this in their class please feel free to  reach out to me the whole idea is that  we are taking the Cross questioning for  you and again asking those students  asking those students writing specific  questions not not content specific  questions thank you to be able to help  that lift uh Barry Carolyn Brent Lee you  were fantastic your facilitator's dream  I had to do almost nothing except  reluctantly stop you all  um could you could you please in the  chat just to the extent you were  interested toss your contact info on the  chat including Barry the link to your uh  to your new friend uh I I have to wrap  things up but I do that only with great  regret thank you so much uh Barry and  Carolyn I love how you each represented  so many different uh points of view with  so many different perspectives uh this  has been this has been terrific and I  thank everybody uh for your thoughts the  uh chat um lesson and I are recording  the chat and the uh and the questions so  that we can post them up uh thank you  all for another brilliant discussion of  this amazingly challenging and  interesting topic uh with a great deal  of importance we should return to this  uh in the New Year in the meantime if  you'd like to keep talking about this  you'll note here that in my slide that  I've added something please use the  hashtag ftte wherever you are on Twitter  I'm still active there and also on  Macedon that's the best way to find me  there Macedon and on my blog we've had  several posts there and more coming up  too if you'd like to go into our  previous session as well as our earlier  sessions about writing and about  plagiarism and cheating academic  integrity and so on just go to  tinyurl.com ftfarchive you can go  through those we have a whole bunch of  sessions coming up please you'll go to  Forum the future of Education the us to  sign up for more and uh if you'd like to  share any of your work including any of  your adventures of chat GPT email me I'd  be glad to share them with the world I'm  very proud of all of you in this  community and I'm delighted delighted to  spread the word in the meantime sorry  we're in over a couple of minutes but  this was all good this is all excellent  thank you all for this uh we're coming  close to the end of the year we have one  more session next week which will be  very light-hearted between now and then  wherever you are stay safe enjoy some  down time if you can it's been a  pleasure being with you all take care  and we'll see you next time online  bye bye
