 foreign  [Music]  s chat GPT the artificial intelligence  chat bot built by open AI has been on an  ambitious Killing Spree timelines  overflow with eulogies to its victims  search engines copywriters coders High  School essays and many more now reports  of these impending deaths may be  exaggerated human beings love to write  the words this will change everything  only to shrug a year later when this  changed very little chatgpt might be a  game changer it might not be either way  the bot is undeniably impressive what  really astounds is its rhetorical muscle  its ability to generate paragraphs of  coherent argument or narrative obviously  there are several million humans to  which it can't hold a candle in this  regard but it instantly hurdled several  million others land ending somewhere in  the neighborhood of a high school  student who's perfectly happy with a B  minus on their Pride and Prejudice book  report 20 years ago that was my  neighborhood if I had access to chat GPT  in 10th grade English I would have used  it without compunction why waste a  perfectly good afternoon scratching out  a five paragraph essay on Austin's  depictions of social class when I could  generate this in seconds in America we  don't call this cheating we call it  working smarter maybe the eulogies are  fitting maybe we'll Outsource writing to  chat GPT like we outsourced math to  calculators spelling to spell check  memory to the internet to a certain  extent the prevalence of essay writing  in school reflects the decline of  memorization as a method of teaching and  learning a decline that feels inevitable  maybe even appropriate in a world where  where the totality of human knowledge is  pocket-sized we assign essays because  they allow teachers to gauge a deeper  understanding in their students they  require more than just recall they  require a personal synthesis of  information which can't be outsourced to  a machine or couldn't be until a few  weeks ago pretty soon English teachers  are going to get that question Math  teachers have been getting for decades  when will we ever need this stuff in  real life now [ __ ] won't work here  teens are just too Savvy for that the  truth is that you'll probably never have  to calculate a definite integral once  you leave school and the truth is we'll  likely Outsource many categories of  basic writing to Ai and never look back  now for other more complex kinds of  writing you could simply start with chat  GPT let it provide the basic structure  then edit to your liking editing after  all is another way way to synthesize  information maybe ours will become a  culture of editors Tweakers embellishers  would that be so bad well the insipid  teenage me would probably say no but the  34 year old me the one who ironically  became a professional essayist leans the  opposite way the difference between  writing and editing is like the  difference between writing and reading  reading is enormously important  obviously it closes the gaps of our  ignorance and expands our knowledge but  it does so through the language of  others their words their sentences their  narratives and arguments editing two  begins with the language of someone else  in the case of chat GPT something else  of course to some extent writing is  editing too we inherit our language and  its rules from culture from the past we  express ourselves through a system that  we didn't invent but that system is so  infinitely flexible that we can use it  to create structures of our own language  is how human beings understand  themselves and the world but writing is  how we understand uniquely not to write  is to live according to the language of  others or Worse to live through edits  tweaks and embellishments to language  generated by an overconfident AI chatbot  I doubt this argument would convince the  teenage me to resist a free Magic tool  that promises easy grades for Less work  as ever it's left to teachers to  impassion their students within a system  that prioritizes grades over learning  often they succeed but even when they  don't they still do the heroic work of  giving insipid high schoolers like  myself be basic writing competence in my  20s when I began to wonder who I really  was and what I really believed questions  that come for all of us I discovered  that writing structuring language of my  own was the only way to find out that's  when the foundation teachers worked so  hard to give me proved its immense value  I hope future Generations have a similar  Foundation One Way or Another new  writing is on its way from the future to  make sense of all of us I think we'll  prefer it to be our own  [Music]  hey everybody thank you so much for  watching this
