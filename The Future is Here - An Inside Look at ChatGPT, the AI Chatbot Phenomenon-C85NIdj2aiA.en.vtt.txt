 in 1952 an AI program was tasked with  purchasing an item from a virtual Mall  consisting of eight stores it would  navigate them all randomly until it  found the desired item then store its  location in memory later when instructed  to find the same item the AI would  effortlessly retrieve the information  from its memory and go directly to the  store where it was previously located to  complete the task this simple program  written by Anthony ottinger at the  University of Cambridge was one of the  first accomplishments in the evolution  of AI little did he know this lit a fire  of beneath the development of artificial  intelligence before I dive into chat GPT  let me give you a brief history of the  evolution of AI  the evolution of AI can be broadly  divided into four stages  the term artificial intelligence was  coined in the early AI stage which  spanned from 1951 to the 1970s  period saw the introduction of AI as a  field at a conference at Dartmouth  College in 1956 the focus of AI during  this time was to develop simple  algorithms for problem solving and  decision making as demonstrated by the  shopping experiment described earlier  expert systems  1980s to 1990s during this era AI was  tailored to emulate the expertise of  human specialists in areas like medical  diagnosis and legal reasoning AI  researchers placed a significant  emphasis on the advancement of knowledge  and reasoning techniques during this  time a prime example of this is kidnap a  computer database support system for  early cancer detection  machine learning 1980s to the present  the 1980s marked a turning point in AI  this machine learning emerged as a  central Focus bolstered by the Advent of  neural networks  this phase saw the evolution of diverse  machine learning methods including  decision trees random forests and  support Vector machines  a noteworthy application of machine  learning is the prediction of travel  time on popular map apps like Google  Maps  deep learning 2010s to present  deep learning A specialized branch of  machine learning leverages the power of  deep neural networks with multiple  layers  period has been categorized by  remarkable advancements in computer  vision natural language processing and  speech recognition  leading to a wealth of practical  applications including self-driving cars  virtual assistants and facial  recognition technology  a prime example of these applications is  chat Bots which provide human-like  responses for tasks such as customer  support and research  overall AI has come a long way since its  Inception and continues to evolve with  advancements in many areas  chat GPT is one of the latest Cutting  Edge contributions to the exciting field  of deep learning in AI  chat GPT is an artificial intelligence  language model developed by open AI  training on a diverse range of internet  text allows it to respond to questions  on a range of topics from history and  science to current events and pop  culture like a human would  open AI the creator of chatgpt is a  research organization that was founded  in 2015 with the goal of promoting and  developing friendly AI that benefits  Humanity  it is based in San Francisco and has a  team of researchers and Engineers with a  common goal in mind  to focus on machine learning and deep  learning techniques  the organization has made several  significant contributions to the field  including the development of gpt3 one of  the largest and most powerful AR  language models to date  open ai's Ultimate mission is to ensure  that artificial intelligence has a  positive impact on the world and to  promote the responsible use of AI to  that end the organization conducts  research development and education  initiatives aimed at advancing the field  and improving public understanding of AI  although chat GPT has been a successful  feat for open AI it does come with its  limitations  lack of Common Sense despite being  trained on a vast amount of tax data  chat GPT lacks a real-world experiences  and emotions that a human has  which means it may not always be able to  understand the context of the  conversation or respond in a way that a  human would this can lead to  misunderstandings or unexpected  responses  bias and training data like most AI  models chat GPT is only as good as the  data it has been trained on  the training data contains biases then  these biases will likely be reflected in  the responses generated by the model  this is a widespread problem in Ai and  machine learning and one that  researchers are working to address  limited understanding of tone and  sarcasm  chat GPT May struggle to detect sarcasm  or irony in text  as these nuances can be difficult to  interpret without a deeper understanding  of context and emotional state this can  lead to inappropriate responses or  misunderstandings  knowledge cut off chat GPT was last  trained on techstarter from 2021 meaning  it may not be aware of recent events or  developments  this knowledge cutoff is a common  limitation of AI models and highlights  the importance of keeping them updated  with the latest information  lack of creativity unlucky human chat  GPT is limited to generating text based  on patterns and relationships it has  learned from its training buildup  this means that while it can respond to  questions and provide information  does not have the capability to generate  new ideas or truly be creative  but enough of the limitations what great  things can chat GPT do and assist humans  with  generating human-like text  as a large language model trained by  open AI chat GPT has been exposed to a  vast amount of internet text  giving it the ability to generate  responses that are similar to those a  human might give this makes it an  effective tool for tasks such as  conversational AI where a natural  sounding response is desired  fast and efficient in addition to its  human-like text generating capabilities  chat GPT is also designed to be fast and  efficient  it can generate responses quickly and at  scale making it useful for tasks such as  data augmentation language translation  and text summarization this makes chat  GPT an ideal solution for applications  that require high volume high quality  text generation wide range of knowledge  chatgpt has been trained on a diverse  range of topics allowing it to respond  to questions on many subjects  its wide range of knowledge makes chat  GPT a versatile tool that can be used in  a variety of domains and applications  consistency to ensure consistency in its  responses chat GPT generates text based  on patterns it has learned from its  training data makes its responses  predictable and reliable which can be  especially useful in applications where  consistency is important  customizability open AI recognizes the  importance of being able to fine-tune  language models to specific tasks or  domains  that's why they provide the capability  to customize chat GPT to a specific use  case allowing it to generate more  accurate and relevant responses  level of customizability makes chat GPT  a flexible tool that can be adapted to  meet the making needs of different  applications and domains  should we be alarmed by the capabilities  of chat GPT and its potential to  perpetuate harmful biases and mimic  human responses despite its lack of  basic common sense  the power of AI language models like  chat GPT  brings about valid concerns about its  impact on society there is a risk of  spreading misinformation or fake news as  chat GPT can generate text that appears  human written it may also perpetuate  biases present in its training data  leading to discriminatory outcomes  Additionally the potential for AI to  automate jobs and displace human workers  raises concerns about unemployment and  economic disruption however  organizations like open AI are working  to address these concerns and promote  responsible AI use  is crucial to be mindful of the  potential risks and strive towards using  AI for the betterment of society  thank you for listening to my deep dive  into chat GPT  if you enjoyed please consider
