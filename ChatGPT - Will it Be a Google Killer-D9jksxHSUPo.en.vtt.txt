 in this video we're discussing the rise  of chat GPT what this means for Google  and how we search online so I'm going to  be honest with you when I first heard  about chat GPT challenging Google search  I was skeptical because come on it's  Google they dominate right  but I've been exploring it more  thoroughly and I want to share my  thoughts with you I wanted to compare  the two so I asked chat GPT and Google  search the same question I asked them  both what is the optimal amount of times  that I should pet my golden retriever in  a day  so this is what they said  Google provided me links  that gave me information on how I how  often I should feed my dog how much a  dog should eat what time of day I should  feed my dog is it cruel to feed a dog  once a day  so ultimately Google search it provided  me with bad information it gave me very  bad links that were totally off topic  now moving on to chat GPT so of course I  asked it the same question I asked what  is the optimal amount of times that I  should pet my golden retriever in a day  so this is what chat GPT said this is  their word for this is their word for  word response  it depends on several factors here are  some guidelines to help you determine  the optimal amount of heading for your  golden retriever  age puppies and Senior Dogs may need  more or less petting puppies may require  more attention and comfort Senior Dogs  may require less attention size larger  dogs may need more petting to help them  feel comfortable and relaxed smaller  dogs may enjoy shorter more frequent  petting sessions  energy level active and energetic dogs  may need more physical stimulation  calmer dogs may be content with shorter  more relaxed petting sessions  and then Chachi PT concluded by saying  in general it's a good idea to pet your  golden retriever several times a day  ranging from a few minutes to longer  sessions depending on your dog's  individual needs regular petting and  grooming can help strengthen your bond  with your dog reduce stress and anxiety  and promote overall well-being now with  that being said I just want to say that  I am a fan of dogs however I'm not a  veterinarian I'm not a dog psychologist  I'm not a dog whisperer but in my  opinion chat GPT it provided a much  better answer to this question compared  to Google search so Google search  provided me links to places that did not  answer my question it was totally  irrelevant it was a disaster and it's my  opinion  I'm not saying that Chachi PT is  superior to Google search as a whole but  I'm saying that in certain instances in  certain circumstances yes chat GPT is  superior to Google search  so is Google search going to become  obsolete my answer is no and if it does  become obsolete well it's going to take  it's going to take a long time it's not  going to happen anytime soon  however people and investors are  realizing that Google and Google search  is not invincible and their Monopoly  it's finally being challenged it's being  challenged seriously  so Google has a near Monopoly in search  they have a 91 market share and that  Monopoly is very lucrative in second  place with three percent of the market  you have Bing so many people are  unfamiliar with Bing so I want to  explain this to you Google has their own  web browsers called Google Chrome most  people know that and they have their own  search engine Google search  so Microsoft has their web browser so  their web browser is Microsoft Edge so  this replaced Internet Explorer and  their search engine is Bing  so Microsoft is integrating Ai and chat  GPT into Edge and Bing to better compete  with Google  so let me tell you this this is the long  story short in 2019 Microsoft invested  one billion dollars into open AI That's  the company that designs chat GPT  since then Microsoft has invested  another two billion dollars into open Ai  and this is I mean honestly this is just  a start  that's three billion dollars that was  used to pay for all the computing power  that open AI needed to build that chat  GPT so building out chatgpt it wasn't  easy it required billions of dollars and  years  so Microsoft has now announced a new  version of Bing that uses the same AI  technology as chat GPT so the CEO of  Microsoft said that web search has not  changed in decades and the AI can  deliver information more fluidly and  quickly than ever before he said and I  quote it's a new day in search the race  starts today and we're gonna move and  move fast  but I do want to say this because I  don't want you to get the wrong  impression so this whole implementation  it's a work in progress even when  they're done with the integration it's  it's going to be far from perfect  so you can for example you can go to  Bing right now and you can ask the same  question how many times should I pet my  golden retriever in a day you're going  to get the same results as Google search  how much to feed a golden retriever how  often dogs should eat and The Shopping  Guide for dry dog food  so now that you know that all this is  going on between Microsoft and Google a  good question is should Google feel  threatened by Microsoft and you know  what they're doing with openai Chachi PT  and Bing  my answers or my opinion is yes  absolutely they should because this is  the first serious threat to Google's 150  billion dollar search business in  decades the CEO of Microsoft is saying  that the new race for search has begun  Bill Gates co-founder of Microsoft says  that chat GPT will change our world  Sochi PT it's shaking Google enough  where Google is asking for guidance and  help from their co-founders that left  three years ago Larry Page and Sergey  Brin  now in response to chechi PT Google  unveiled their AI chat bot it's called  Bard and it was a disaster  it provided inaccurate information and  Google stock you know that day it  plummeted so Google employees they've  been criticizing the CEO of Google for  rushing and botching their AI chatbot  now I want to tell you my real  experience with chat GPT  so I took my my YouTube scripts you know  these you know I write them I type them  up and then I copied and pasted into  Chachi PT and I told chatgpt to reword  it and make it better  so my videos they focus on the economy  investing taxes it's a financial Channel  I use a lot of factual information to  form my opinions in chechi PT it output  me a bunch of garbage  so yes it rearranged my script but there  were so many factual errors it was it  was like AI I was trying to sabotage my  work it was actually pretty comical  so if you wanted to plagiarize my work  download my script from any one of my  videos put into chatgpt rearrange it and  then try to pass it off as your own  then I'll tell you that you better know  your stuff because you better know what  you're talking about because Chachi PT  is going to Output errors it's going to  Output a lot of errors it's going to be  very far from perfect so ultimately  you're going to have to catch those  errors and you're going to have to do a  lot of revision work  so for some things yes check GPT it's  really good and it's going to make you  more efficient and much more productive  you know one example was if you're  trying to find obscure information  Google search a lot of times it's not  going to be good at that like how many  how many times should you be petting  your golden retriever it's going to be  providing you a superior answer compared  to Google search  so I'm sure that many people have heard  that for simple coding chat GPT it's  actually very effective so that's one of  many examples where it actually does  shine  so I want to tell you about other  industries that I believe that chechi PT  will revolutionize quickly this is what  I call this is what I would say is you  know the low-hanging fruits  it's a customer service and support So  if you didn't notice many companies are  already using AI in their customer  support chat  so you're not speaking with a human it's  a robot in so many of the instances and  so many of the companies  and they can only handle your most basic  questions and if they're not being  helpful I would say do not argue with  them because The Joke is on You you're  arguing with the robots  existing customer support chat Bots will  receive AI upgrades in the near future  and this is going to be a game changer  for customer support  I also believe that Chachi PT will be  very beneficial in education  so AI this is the way I see it I believe  that AI is going to be able to provide  students with personalized learning  experiences so imagine how helpful this  will be if you let's just say that you  have a child that's slow in math or if  they're gifted in math  so think of lessons programs tutors  teachers just the whole education system  that is catered to the level and the  speed of your child or your students so  this will bring personalization to  learning so I think that this will be a  game changer for education  and a lot of people are focusing their  attention on saying that students  students are going to use chechi PT to  plagiarize their essays you know kids  aren't going to learn anything  well I mean obviously how are you going  to use chechi PT to cheat on an in-class  exam or in in Class essay you know how  good is Chachi PT going to be there it's  not going to save you and if you didn't  know for the past 20 years there have  been online services where you can pay  someone five bucks in Bangladesh to  write the essay for you so this is  nothing new you don't need chat GPT to  plagiarize or copyright or cheats in  school  so obviously all there's been so many  methods to do that for thousands of  years  so plagiarism comes from the Roman word  that means kidnapper because the Roman  poets ripped off work of someone else  and failed to cite the original authors  so again thousands of years  this Chachi PT is nothing new in terms  of cheating or plagiarism  now I want to end with this my thoughts  on Google Search and Google stock  is Google behind on their Tech so it's  an AI war and yes Google lost the first  battle  but I would say don't be naive because  Google has been spending billions of  dollars on AI and they've been they have  been taking this very seriously the good  news for Google is that being an edge  and chat GPT it's not  it's not perfect it's very far from  perfect  but honestly I am you know I'm very  happy to see that Google has some  competition in search which is probably  I mean it's probably a good thing for  everyone  I personally would buy and invest in  Google stock but I'm personally going to  wait for a better price  this whole chat GPT shows that Google is  not Invincible it shows that if they get  complacent that someone's going to come  up with a better mousetrap and they're  going to eat their lunch if you want to  buy Google I would say wait for the  economy to degrade you know companies  are going to reduce their ad spend cpms  are going to go down and I would say let  this fear this fear of Microsoft and  chat GPT I would say let it further  manifest and I just want to say if you  enjoy investing content please check out  our patreon we have exclusive stock  market and crypto contents I'll leave a  link down below we have
