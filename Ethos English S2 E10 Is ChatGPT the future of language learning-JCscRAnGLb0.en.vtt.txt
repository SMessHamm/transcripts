 [Music]  magic is in short supply we live in a  world in which the average person has  become Jaded by technological innovation  this was the main idea in a recent  episode of akimbo hosted by the renowned  technology and business blogger Seth  Godin this particular episode of his  entitled magic and possibility was quite  timely we say that something is timely  when something happens at exactly the  right time and why do I say that it was  timely because on the very same day that  is November 30th that one of the leading  Lights of the tank and business world  comes out saying that there are no  longer any Innovations profound enough  to leave us in awe that is amazed  impressed astounded well that same day  chat GPT was released by openai to the  General Public  welcome back to ethos English the go-to  podcast for advanced English Learners  and the people who teach them don't  forget that you'll find a full text  version of the show including links to  all the readings I mentioned in the show  notes at ethosenglish.com podcast as I  go along I paraphrase vocabulary you  might have trouble with at the end of  the episode I go over each item with a  full definition and an example  now back to chat Bots pretty much every  magazine newspaper and blogger has  already written something on the subject  so you might say I'm late to the party  when you're late to the party you find  out about something or start becoming  involved in something later than most  other people  anyway I wanted to weigh in on the  subject that is give my opinion because  I think it has so much positive  potential for language Learners and  teachers so first things first what is  chat GPT it's a chat bot that and  generates natural sounding and even  somewhat sophisticated text based on  prompts you just go to openai.com and  set up a free account and tell it the  kind of text you'd like  Daniel Herman wrote a piece in the  Atlantic called the end of high school  English by the way don't forget all the  articles I mentioned you can find links  to them in the show notes at  ethosenglish.com podcast So Daniel  Herman in this piece in the Atlantic  rights as a fellow English teacher the  following  the arrival of open ai's chat GPT a  program that generates sophisticated  text in response to any prompt you can  imagine May signal the end of writing  assignments altogether and maybe even  the end of writing as a gatekeeper a  metric for intelligence a teachable  skill  if you're looking for historical analogs  this would be like the printing press  the steam drill and the light bulb  having a baby and that baby having  access to the entire Corpus of human  knowledge and understanding my life and  the lives of thousands of other teachers  and professors tutors and administrators  is about to drastically change  he then concludes the essay further on  with the following statement everything  is made up it's true the essay as a  literary form made up grammatical rules  as markers of intelligence writing  itself as a technology made up starting  now open AI is forcing us to ask  foundational questions about whether any  of those things are worth keeping around  end of quotation now I'm sorry to  disagree with Daniel Herman but I think  all of the hype around AI has got the  better of him that is it's affected his  reasoning he seems to easily defeated to  easily convinced of the futility of  Education  I'm not even sure he believes himself  what he says sure we're going to have to  test our students writing skills  differently maybe with more in-class  assignments but give up on communication  skills because computers are learning to  mimic us  we've had machines stronger than any  human for ages and that doesn't stop us  from going to the gym to build stronger  bodies why would our intellect be any  different  I mean you don't hear people saying  what's the point of working out I'm  never going to be as strong as a  bulldozer that's absurd  in this debate about AI I'm reminded of  the luddites the movement began in  Nottingham England in 1811. they were a  group of radical politically active  Weavers who decided to vandalize new  mechanical looms being used in textile  mills because this technology was  destroying their livelihoods that is  their ability to make a living  nowadays when groups of people oppose  new technologies on ethical moral or  philosophical grounds that they can be  referred to as neoludites  although some people proudly refer to  themselves as neolar dates nowadays I  tend to see it more as something  negative a kind of refusal to accept  change a few days ago an article  appeared in New York Times entitled what  would Plato say about chat GPT the  author the sociologist zainab eki points  out that Plato was critical of the  invention of the alphabet and thus of  written language he saw writing as  potentially harmful to the all-important  function of human memory  to factory draws a clever parallel with  our own attitude to AI are we being  short-sighted about this Innovation much  like Plato was with respect to writing  I'm going to read a short excerpt which  explains how chat GPT or something like  it could be used in the classroom  according to to fechi  in flipped classrooms students wouldn't  use chat GPT to conjure up a whole essay  instead they'd use it as a tool to  generate critically examined building  blocks of essays it would be similar to  how students in advanced math classes  are allowed to use calculators to solve  complex equations without replicating  tedious previously mastered steps  teachers could assign a complicated  topic and allow students to use such  tools as part of their research  assessing the veracity and reliability  of these AI generated notes and using  them to create an essay would be done in  the classroom with guidance and  instruction from teachers the goal would  be to increase the quality and the  complexity of the argument  to give a more concrete idea of how  language Learners and teachers might  make the most of AI I created a chat GPT  account and gave it the following prompt  write a paragraph about prisons using  such thereby rehabilitate and parole  that is I told it the topic I wanted the  text on and the specific vocabulary I  wanted to be included  here is the resulting text  prisons are institutions that are  designed to hold individuals who have  been convicted of a crime and are  serving a sentence the main goal of  Prisons is to rehabilitate inmates and  help them become productive members of  society upon their release  to achieve this goal prisons offer a  variety of programs and services such as  education and job training to help  inmates acquire the skills and knowledge  they need to succeed outside of prison  in addition prisons also have parole  boards that review the cases of inmates  who are eligible for parole however  parole is not always granted and many  inmates end up serving their full  sentences  what impressed me the most was how  natural the text sounded what's more  it's full of incredibly useful  collocations that would be useful for a  student writing an essay related to the  topic of Prisons  we have serve a sentence rehabilitate  inmates and the especially nice chunk  become productive members of society  upon their release then there's parole  board the eligible for parole and Grant  parole  you could say that chat GPT served up a  fantastic mind map of sorts a lexically  dense and useful paragraph covering key  language related to the topic I think  this kind of thing would be a great  in-class activity to get students mining  useful language almost like a paragraph  long dictionary entry not on a single  word but on a concept  and another thing just occurred to me  what if we built the kind of education  system where students aspired to write  their own texts and not copy them word  for word from a chatbot what if we made  writing assignments so compelling and  rewarding that students wouldn't want to  cheat  what if these new circumstances Force us  to give students more personal topics  related to their own lives  we could take inspiration from the  social psychologist James pennybaker's  work on so-called expressive writing and  don't forget I'm including a link here  in the notes  now to finish on a funny note let me  share the chat GPT text that the  economist printed in its Pages as a joke  one of their journalists instructed the  chatbot to explain what chat GPT is  using Shakespeare in English and since  most stuff by The Economist is behind a  paywall I'm going to read out to you the  answer that this chatbot came up with  I it is true that it is a wondrous thing  these generative artificial  intelligences or gtps as they be known  it is a Marvel of modern science as tis  no wonder that tis taking the World by  storm  but what are they truly and why should  we care  gpts be a type of AI technology that can  generate natural language in response to  input it is a form of deep learning  wherein the computer system is trained  on vast amounts of Text data and then  can generate its own text based on what  it has learned it is more than mere hype  it is a powerful tool that can be used  for a multitude of applications from  creating content to aiding and customer  service  ah Shakespeare's turning over in his  grave now thanks for listening if you  enjoy the show please take the time to  rate and review it if you want to get in  touch you can send me an email to Sean  at  ethosenglish.com now  as I was saying please if you have the  time  and the inclination rate and review the  show this is how I reach new listeners  which by the way is a lot harder than  you think  also why not share your favorite episode  with a friend who shares your passion  for becoming improbably articulate in  English  finally there's my Instagram account  ethos English with Sean in case you want  yet more regular content now here's this  week's vocabulary be in short supply  when something is only available in  small amounts example gasoline was in  short supply after the war that is there  was a shortage BJ did someone who is  Jaded is no longer interested in or  excited by something usually because  they've experienced too much of it  example flying is exciting the first  time you do it but you soon become jaded  be timely done or happening at exactly  the right time example the flight ended  rather the fight ended only with the  timely arrival of the police  a Leading Light  a respected person who leads a group or  organization or is important in a  particular area of knowledge or activity  example  a Leading Light in the art world she was  a close friend of the director  awe a feeling of great respect sometimes  mixed with fear or surprise  children we were rather in awe of our  grandfather  be late to the party informal find out  about something or start becoming  involved in something later than most  other people  example I've just started watching Game  of Thrones yeah I know I'm late to the  party  weigh in on a subject informal give an  opinion or enter a discussion or  argument  example a common criticism of  influencers is that they weigh in on  subjects which they know nothing about  first things first use to say that  something should be done or dealt with  first because it is the most important  example first things first let's have  something to eat  get the better of someone if a feeling  gets the better of you you cannot stop  yourself from allowing that feeling to  make you do something despite knowing  that what you are doing is wrong example  her curiosity got the better of her and  she opened the door and peeped inside  on moral ethical philosophical grounds  that is for moral ethical philosophical  reasons  another example  the factory was closed on health and  safety grounds  foreign be short-sighted about something  disapproving not thinking enough about  how an action will affect the future  example it's very short-sighted of the  government not to invest in  technological research  veracity formal the fact of being true  or correct synonym truth  example has anyone checked the veracity  of these allegations
