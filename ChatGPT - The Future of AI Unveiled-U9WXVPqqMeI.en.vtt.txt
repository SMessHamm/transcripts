 foreign  [Music]  should we start and then  oh  I feel like that face that honestly I'm  ready for right now really  yeah did you get up early I well you're  the early riser kind of there's a riser  in harmony  so I woke up at eight this morning  um that's probably what time pat went to  bed  I went to bed at two  45 what kept you up actually 3 30. I  finished Black Panther the second one I  changed my opinion uh all right on the  first one and second one the new one  forever one more set it was so good  really hey dude I  oh you cried I cried  when the Black Panther's son oh spoiler  wait wait he's got it wait he's got a  son oops I haven't seen it for real  that's all I'll say then I I cried right  there like a baby who did Black I  watched half the movie I was like this  sucks  then it got me I I heard that was like  really woke was it really woke that's  why so in Rotten Tomato it's 98 and I  was like oh wow on IMDb it's like six oh  I trust IMDb more though I don't after  watching this  and then all the one like one star  comments or one out of ten ratings it's  the dumbest thing I've ever heard in my  life they got spammed with one like one  ratings do you think they were just  doing that just because it just to do a  normal black panther can I be like  honest with you be honest like my real  opinions let us know about this today I  think it is a one  maybe I'm reading way too much oh  I I feel like it's just the divide in  our country you have the Republicans and  conservatives I mean the the  rituals and the conservatives those Reds  and I  I'm just gonna be really honest  uh Whenever there is a movie with 99 of  the people in the movie who are black  there are a ton of people out there who  don't like that which is which yeah it's  yeah stupid so they just they assume  against it yeah they assume it's a lot  they assume it's a liberal movie and  it's not yeah the actors and actresses  are incredible the storyline was so good  and I cried dog and I don't which is  weird because the first black panther is  it's great yeah yeah there's a lot of  hate for that too  because yeah the color of the actors and  actresses skin and where but it's like  where they're at like that it makes  sense yeah there's a there's a cultural  context and all that stuff and yeah that  that's pretty crazy I didn't know that  but I didn't know the first one got a  lot of yeah I didn't I didn't really  know that either I remember it being  like huge on Twitter I follow a lot of  people on both sides yeah and like when  it came out a lot of the people on the  right side were just dogging on the moon  really dogging on it see I've I've heard  some people docking on it he's woke  liberal Hollywood people in there woke  agenda it's like what are you guys  talking about yeah like I I thought it  was woke for like other reasons not just  because it's like mostly a black cast  that's not why I thought I thought it  was just like they're just trying to  push something they didn't you just  heard that it was well yeah yeah you  just assumed it was something else yeah  well with with what Disney's been put  now like light year yeah oh my goodness  yeah you think it was did you think it  was that kind of well yeah I thought  that there would be certain leads in the  movie you know that'd be and they'd be  pushing things you mean like how  Disney's been pushing the gay agenda all  that stuff all that stuff on kids which  is not okay how like you have that stuff  in regular movies if you want to don't  feed it down kids through no yeah and  even like people that are for it like  not for Disney doing it but just like on  that side of things yeah they're even  saying like it's a bad idea to just yeah  do that to kids that's one that's that's  what Trump is actually running on yeah  if you've seen all his new speeches and  stuff  he's he's running on how there's just  this agenda to sexualize our kids and  the whole you know just a culture  pushing kids to be who they want if you  want to be a girl if you want to be a  guy don't put that stuff on kids no  don't give kids hormones that are going  to mess with their bodies for the rest  of their life yeah because that's the  best thing to grow up and make that yeah  yeah that's a decision that they don't  get to make yes yeah like parents like  because this is stuff that I'm watching  like on my off time like on my own I'm  always watching uh just like  conservative things yeah and and just a  bunch of crazy things that are just  happening nowadays uh but yeah like how  they're pumping hormones into kids  that's insane uh and people just  thinking that they could be one thing  and other thing it's just insane yeah I  think I think you should wait  I don't think America can tell anyone  what to do yeah you know we can't but I  think there should be a law to where you  wait until these kids brains are fully  developed and because there's countless  stories especially searching on YouTube  oh of people who made decisions like  that when they were younger even recent  you know they made decisions like that  and then later on in life come to regret  it big time yeah when are these girls I  mean 14 15 16 year olds years old who  had their breasts chopped off and now  they're doing it to some kids yeah  because they said they want to be a boy  my kids tell me Nash was like I want to  be a fire truck I'm not gonna go park  him outside of the fires go park my son  out back yeah because it's not you don't  need to take it literal like when like  kids like they say they want to be stuff  all the time yeah so that's why you have  to wait till it's like no longer play  yeah like seriously have you heard like  all the arguments for that stuff like uh  like the gender debate and all that  stuff I really love watching Ben Shapiro  and now while she's gonna mention him  because he did a he did a podcast with  uh  full send yeah I I guarantee checking  that out I'll watch that it's really  good yeah because he talks about the  agenda for Disney awesome oh there's how  he wants to make his own channel for  kids yeah and they have they have it on  a daily wire daily Wire yeah like I seen  a video this was probably about a year  ago I think it was a year ago could it  could be two years because pandemic  times go by just real quick yeah but but  um it was like the leaked Disney agenda  yeah but it was like clear quality and  it was like all these Zoom meetings and  like uh some president of the company I  don't know if they're like the top top  but I think they were given like the  title president and they said that they  want 50 of their characters to be  lgbtqia plus but yeah he was fired  because it's hurting Disney's bottom  line yeah like have you seen uh tanked  like Strange World I think that's what  it's called strange world uh it has like  two gay leads and totally bombed that  came after light year didn't it yeah  light year totally bombed which which  you wouldn't think but that was just  from one scene yeah yeah I know for like  imagine maybe it was like a whole  because it gets picked up by all these  moms on Facebook who mm-hmm bro don't  underestimate underestimate the power of  them all of a mom well I I know man  I'm yeah it's crazy like put that stuff  in your movies and give the adults the  choice to watch it but when you're  pushing out Disney movies which every  kid wants to watch don't put it in there  don't put that and so what is it but  what does it do for the company itself  like what does it do for the person  pushing it onto kids they get walk  points but which is so good points yeah  like look at us being inclusive and blah  blah blah like look at me just this is  just virtual singling and here's what I  think it comes down to I think  the far left side because there's a lot  of liberals who are totally against this  a majority but there's a vocal far left  yeah there's the loudest yeah they'll be  the ones who show up at your company  they'll be the ones who you know get on  Twitter and Facebook and boycott your  company but what you're seeing now and  what you've seen with Disney  is now mom's in the far right are like  okay we're gonna do that too yeah  they're doing the same thing so Disney  has made some changes at the top uh Ron  DeSantis made some changes in their laws  Rhonda Santos Disney's uh they're taxed  now they're not their own like their own  government yeah that's what Rhonda said  yeah that's what Rhonda santhis was  against was like Disney's not going to  be their own government they're not  gonna and they're gonna be paying all  these taxes and stuff yeah yeah Ron  DeSantis is like fighting Disney in  Florida right now  let me tell you this isn't going to help  us grow our YouTube  absolutely not I think we were pushed a  little bit last week with us talking  about conspiracies well this one's  definitely gonna like  I I if YouTube I don't know which way  YouTube leans I don't know but I don't  know it's definitely this should never  get on the daily Wire yeah  or Stephen either either side we'll ride  with either side we'll get behind you  yeah here's what I know trying to grow  your YouTube channel is like trying to  fix a car with duct tape and hope hey  that works like you we may not know what  we're doing but at least we're the most  duct taped but yeah and we have duct  tape and hope check us out yeah and art  yeah we didn't  we're we're just we're just doing we're  getting there man we got some faithful  subscribers I got people reaching out to  me every day hey I watched your podcast  I love it yeah uh here where we live uh  there's no school a lot of work like  places yeah workplaces were closed okay  you guys got me through the day really  yeah like uh who oh  uh I don't know don't say anything yeah  I don't think we can say names anymore  we're getting too big to say names too  big maybe with our not even 200 Subs we  got to make 200 Subs by next right next  to get there hey last time we made a  goal we hit it and we did and we're  close I think we're at like 140 right  now we said so we said 150 by episode  eight this is episode six I thought we  said 200 by episode I don't think we  said 200. did we not we can go back  we'll yeah I will check thankfully with  us either way we still have time but  yeah like um there's someone from our  church and he goes he was telling me how  he watched all of our episodes yesterday  or the day before or something like that  and and he goes yeah I just got finished  watching the most recent one you binge  watched all that stuff you binged  watched our stupidity are you kidding me  I have no idea why anyone would watch  yes I sometimes when I I watch podcasts  it's always always the people that  aren't like fully known yet yeah it's  the most fun ones yeah here's what I  know like some of our Clips will bomb on  YouTube but all of our podcasts get 100  or 100 yeah yeah closer they're pushing  200 now yeah and we're growing we're  growing slowly we're gonna get there  uh we're gonna find an audience who  watches this and they're like hey these  are my kind of people yeah all we got to  do is find those people and there's  Millions out there oh absolutely yeah  and it's just great to see the growth  and I was looking I think it was last  night because on my YouTube channel  that's when I was going through all the  Pod culture stuff liking it yeah and I  was looking through all the comments I  really wish I would have saved those  comments so we could read them here on  the podcast I will do it one day that  would be so fun uh because let them know  that they're being heard and that we  actually appreciate you know like the  engagement yeah the engagement would be  fun uh yeah I've seen some goofy ones  like like okay can I uh can I call  someone out insert cringe  um  stop I  think I know  I don't know I think I know who it is  too I think I don't know Dylan has an  idea I don't think it's him though  oh man it's gonna be really hard to talk  about who it is their first name so I'm  thinking c yeah does it end with a B  yeah no that's not him well then who's  the other one I had another one  um by the way uh if you know if if you  know we were just talking about you this  person I think though goes on a lot of  videos and just puts cringy things or  they'll say like  they just let people know if this video  is cringe oh okay but hey thank you for  watching yeah we we definitely  appreciate it just keep your crap to  yourself  get it I like  no it it is fun it was just weird like  just going through and just seeing how  they because it's legit like I feel like  it's a little cliche to say wait till  he's like your gaming channel oh my  goodness game Hofer yeah so I attack him  yeah come at me  watch your beef is with liver King and  my beef is with some dude named insert  cringe  hey me and liver King are good now oh  yeah did you guys make up no no you're  you're just dropping it no I just have  an idea oh so you're gonna put him in  you're gonna take him you're gonna get  him here yeah can I give a shout out to  someone shout out uh Ruslan KD yes gotta  give a shout out to you dog lovers he's  been helping us a lot behind the scenes  like any questions we have  he just like instantly replies yeah I  didn't know you were I think you were  telling me that which I still think is  insane because I've been watching Bruce  on for like a year or two he got me  through my Subway days man when I worked  at Subway like when I had like when I  had a slow  um when I had like time for a break I'd  make myself a sandwich yeah head to the  back uh turn Ruslan on my phone and I'd  watch him I'd watch Alan Parr uh some  Mike Winger back there man you look like  a Subway guy uh that's a little racy I  think did you did you wear an open cap  no I wore like one of those flat caps  okay  um did you meet that uh Jared  did you meet Jared uh no but I did get  really acquainted with our tuna though  and uh  disgusting that's that's what I was  thinking about the tuna controversy  um actually they they said it's not fake  yeah like it's funny because uh Subway  actually boosted from that whole  controversy because yeah because people  were coming out trying to sue them and  so what Subway did they went like half  price like foot long subs for a tuna  sandwiches oh wow and they made like so  much money they almost like doubled it  because people were buying like yeah  like I think they have were they just  saying having the same amount of like  sales so I think their sales increased  because uh they made him half price  because of the lawsuit so they they're  like okay we can sell more of them now  yeah because it's getting so much  attention because like when I see half  price I just go oh I'll just buy two so  that's equal to one right I just don't  trust anyone who orders tuna at Subway  no it's kind of weird or gets it toasted  oh my goodness it's disgusting or  they'll get it like yeah like there's  there's a time where I opened up the  store  um and someone came in hey let me get a  footlong uh tuna and I said okay he goes  oh they get the tuna toasted well like  the sandwich the like because I get my  sandwich toasted yeah but like the but  the tuna on the sandwich like you know  when you put your okay when you put the  meat on it you get it toasted yeah yeah  they do that with a tuna they put like  lettuce and cucumbers on it I don't know  but there's been people who've like done  butt loads of like olives like black  olives uh is it mayo and tuna a thing  yes that's actually how you make it so  yeah there's Mayo in it yeah it's like  it I don't know what the person is it'd  be like 25 to 50 Mayo because like like  back there you have to make it yourself  gross you get like you get this big bowl  um and you get like a packet of tuna  it's like a square it's like a rectangle  like a block of cheese  kind of like it's flat  um it's almost like an Amazon package  so so you open it up you put it in the  bowl then you do like  I can't remember the exact portion I  think it's like either half or 75 yeah  of uh are you allowed to say this  um you get sued come at me bro sign a  contract how long ago did you work there  that was that was well close to two  years now and how long did you work  there I a year and a half I think  obviously you got pretty acquainted yeah  I oh you knew the menu top to bottom  um and they changed the menu up like  crazy like really I how can you change  up a sandwich oh they ruined they ruined  it it's so expensive now yeah it's  pretty crazy like I if I go like  nowadays I'm close to spitting like  people confusing too Subway fix your  stuff maybe give Jared a call maybe he's  got some tips for you don't call Jared  put your kids away yeah don't call Jared  stay away from Jared God j-rod he's  controversial just like we are at the  beginning  you guys remember Pee Wee Herman yeah  are you talking about how he got  arrested no do you remember all the  rumors about him about how he was a a  p word yeah  those are all fake rumors I watched the  documentary they're all made up none of  them are real uh his PeeWee Herman movie  where his bike gets stolen oh is that  the big holiday or is it no no no it's  not a holiday one or is that his  vacation well either I don't know what  which one it is but his bike gets stolen  that is one of the most scariest movies  I've seen really I think it's just when  I watched it I it might have been so he  goes like on this big old adventure to  find his bike and is is that the one  where he's trying to go to the basement  of the Alamo or something like that I  think so uh yeah that's the original  that's the original one like I went  through like an 80s phase and I was  watching all this stuff and and  Pee-wee's Playhouse man did you watch  all the earnest was it like Ernest Saves  Christmas yeah like what they were  called yeah that is a movie yeah I was  telling uh Dylan about the TV show that  that they had  Ernest had a TV show yeah I totally  forget what it's called it might have  just been called Earnest or something  like that because Dylan and I like to  make a joke like you know what I mean  Vern and that's from Ernest yeah that's  from like uh apparently yeah like in the  show uh like us audience uh Ernest is  just doing a bunch of stupid stuff yeah  and he comes he goes you know what I  mean Vern come on earn so we we are Vern  that's the guy who can never get out of  playing anyone other than her Earnest  really other than a Slinky Dog  yeah because he played slink from twos  to  Tuesday  hello  it's your wife bro I know Dylan's wife  is like sweeping right in front of the  door or she's wrapping one of the dogs  up in aluminum foil  has been making Instagram reels like  they're going out of style right she's  supposed to like 10 the past couple days  oh yeah I'm gonna be honest if she keeps  posting

sure  oh that's funny it does say car I was so  confused because he told me it twice I  was like okay right cool now I  understand  So today we're going to be talking about  artificial  Arnold Arnold Arnold artificial  intelligence  that's the government name Arnold Fisher  a-i-a-i not Alan Iverson what artificial  intelligence AI Alan Iverson what is  Allen Iverson are you kidding are you  kidding Hey listen actually the window's  right there to the window  Alan Iverson's one of the greatest AI  one of the biggest one of the best what  greatest point guards oh that's right  because um I don't watch basketball so  that's why well I didn't want I mean I  kind of watched them but  like I know like the big big names you  know like the guys that you talked about  is like I have never heard of them  before no I only hear about like the  goats MVP dog he's a move  he's  he's the he's the Philly goat yeah he  changed uh he's the one that gave  Swagger to basketball okay first of all  anyone using the word swagger uh I yeah  I know I know  if you're watching by the way Pat what  do you know about artificial  intelligence man I've been playing a lot  with uh then is it chat GB gbt yeah I  think so I don't know GPT GPT bro it's  nuts yeah crazy has he showed you uh he  hadn't showed me but I've seen like AI  just making everything like that's what  the content is nowadays it will do  anything it'll write a blog for you so  for my website I did write me a Blog  about Shay Gill just Alexander here are  my biases  I want you to touch on this topic bam  and it just it goes to town we were in  his office and we were like write a  worship song about I forgot what the  topic was Resurrection Resurrection in  the key of G bam it gave us what chords  and everything what it was the  progression yes as he was showing me it  I was thinking to myself this is scary  it is scary because if it could do all  this stuff then they're gonna figure out  how to like like it's smarter than  people like yeah like start producing  things and if we don't have a zombie  apocalypse it's gonna definitely be an  artificial intelligence apocalypse man  we've had two different kind of AIS you  have weak Ai and then strong AI weak AI  is like an AI that will perform tax  tasks for you strong AI is what like  this AI can do what a human can do so  that's what we're seeing now but what we  have right now is just a limited they  don't it wants to get more people in  there get more data points asking more  questions it's going to grow and grow  but here's the problem right now okay  the main companies who are going to be  getting this because everyone once it's  out all these big companies are going to  start taking this and using it for  themselves it's going to be Google it's  going to be apple meta all these people  and they're going to be able to  manipulate it however they want their  like chat GPT right GPT yeah GPT  I sound like an idiot talking about this  I can't even say the name dude I've I've  been messing with so many AI websites  this week it's just popped off the past  month  um  but what was it saying about chat gbt uh  lost my turn of thought help me out  you're saying how it was popping off oh  yeah so all these all these comp all  these companies are being able to get it  they're going to be able to say what you  can and can't say they're going to  manipulate data then they're going to be  able to control the world because right  now there's limits on it you can't just  go in there and be like  tell me like give me a video idea that  will go viral give me the YouTube tags  the right title right now to give you  ideas but it won't just so in depth so  so like it can produce but it can't like  tell the future like you can't read like  The algorithm or anything like that I I  well they're just parameters yeah and  they're they're only running running at  a certain point right now but once  someone gets a hold of it who takes all  the parameters off you're gonna be able  to say like how can I  you know did you guys hear about that  guy who killed his wife no supposedly  and then Googled about it all night how  do I get rid of the body oh how do I was  asking questions on Google from like uh  11 P.M to like 8 A.M wow like how do I  get rid of the body how do I cut the  body like all this crazy stuff well once  this comes out people like that are  going to be able to get away with it how  can I how can I kill my wife how can I  get away with this bam but it's gonna  give you like good instructions yes  because it's taken the data from  everywhere  like here's how this person did it or  think about when like a company like  Google has it and they have access to  all this data and they're able to or no  let's skip that let's go to a government  how can I overthrow a country without  them knowing like it's this AI whoever  gets to it first  like unfiltered no parameters that's  gonna be it's gonna be crazy I put it in  a way of like AI isn't bad but like  super intelligence is bad yeah you know  that's I was watching a video earlier  um just to kind of get ready for this  and Elon Musk is like  super intelligent he's really like a  very smart guy  um Tesla like driving cars that's like a  version of AI sort of  um and he he's even been warning us like  this stuff is dangerous yes that's why  he's colonizing Mars for when the robots  take over yeah he doesn't want to be  yeah no yeah we're just giving it like  right now right now it's driving cars  it's robots that can build cars it's you  know AI generators to give you an essay  report or something but like people are  going to create these things that are  eventually just going to be smarter than  them yeah and like I was thinking  earlier like here's like a simple one  like Walmart self-checkout like that  took people's jobs yeah yeah imagine 2  15 years from now maybe even 10 years  from now like what else are they going  to be able to do yeah  I really should be getting an employee  discount using those yeah I need to go  to the break room because you're you're  working because I'm doing that we should  get a discount period since we're not  paying someone to do the work for us  yeah yeah like for instance I talked I  put my typing points in today today  we're talking about blah blah blah give  me some talking points  oh oh it gave you something oh it gave  me like a hundred I took like eight of  them so eight of your points are AI  generated yeah that's perfect example  because if they're good then that's just  even scary so like so are you able to  set your points now or do we have to  like way go through them  do you have a point that you want to  bring up  I was just going to talk you know the  the impact on jobs is going to be insane  yeah that's why you remember the learn  to code thing that happened a couple  years ago and anyone who said it on like  Twitter got banned oh really yeah but  man people are gonna like that's where  things are shifting the the truck  driving industry is about to be taken  over by Tesla and other companies yeah  we're already testing them out in some  states which the yeah  the potential impact on jobs the privacy  issues Dylan now we're looking at this  new AI uh website that you log into on  your computer and then it you just keep  log you stay logged in and at any point  in time you like let's say you watched a  video  five months ago you remember the topic  you don't remember exactly what it was  you put the topic in it'll go to the  video you were watching what you could  clip it see what they were like if it  was in the video it'll find the part in  the video for you it like logs your  every move every single move and you can  search it and it gives you pictures  videos of everything you've watched it's  crazy and but when when bigger com like  chat gbt is a good company the people  have created it understand all these  issues yeah they understand like the  issue of hey if governments get a hold  of this and figure out how to do this uh  if Google and apple and all these people  start doing this there's gonna be some  problems yeah because these people are  they don't want to see other companies  succeed they want to be the biggest they  want all the data but then imagine them  having everyone's data they're already  doing it tracking our phones yeah I mean  I  let's talk about Ford trucks right now  after the podcast I'm gonna go look on  Facebook and there's going to be four  trucks popping up his ads it's creepy  because sometimes it happens like I I  swear there was one time I was just  thinking of something and it popped up  on on like whatever I was looking at it  tracks all your data there used to be  this glitch on the iPhone to where you  could take a like a live photo say one  two three click it and you play it back  and it hears you saying the one and two  before you press the button to record  like their capturing gave it that  permission before exactly they're  capturing all of our data and it's like  like live photos that's pretty weird yes  like we're all just think it's normal  yeah like a live photo because you can  click it and it shows motion yeah and  what do they do they're saying they're  selling our data to companies who are  trying to make money like trying to  figure out their target audience  it makes me wonder like online banking  like does that become at risk or is it  really secure everything's at risk  because it has my face ID yeah and my  face ID opens myself yeah you'd probably  be this idea does all that stuff you'd  probably be safe for just to cash  everything like just hold it on I put it  in that jar and bury it yeah I can  guarantee you this the people at the top  you know some of the biggest people in  government are in Tech they're not using  some banks regular online banking  they're not doing it yeah no they  probably got their own thing going on  but like uh with with all this AI like  taking over like if it's going to be  taking jobs almost like to the point  where we can't even work anymore yeah  does that mean our country is going to  turn communist do you think because  there'd be like no capitalism if no  one's working right oh like no money  fluctuations yeah like no money  fluctuation and so they almost have to  like destroy what is it called the  barter system yeah so I think the trade  I think that's like End Time stuff yeah  like barter system isn't there something  about like robots or like some  intelligence like at the end of the  world like chips and stuff oh yeah like  that's what people assume there's  there's been some like Christian movies  with that perspective really like maybe  the mark of the beast is a chip yeah  maybe oh okay oh like when the when the  vax like in 2020 when everyone was  talking about the facts are like is this  the market the bees now we're gonna get  a coven  got him  oh goodness I remember our second  episode we told Isaac every time he  laughs he's a back away from the mic man  oh I I went full force I was I was  reading last night when I was just  studying AI stuff and nerd I was on the  subreddit that talks about all the  advancements in Ai and there's people  who are creating only fans accounts with  completely AI generated girls what  supposed to look completely real but  they're fake and that's what this stuff  like that's where this stuff is leading  like you're and it's almost like like  wasn't there like a big deal with like  the whole virtual reality stuff because  it's almost like taking them out of  reality yeah which hasn't hit off like  met as expected yeah because people  aren't walking around with this giant no  Oculus on their face you know I remember  once it gets smaller what if what if it  like they open up jobs and stuff they  already do people get paid you can like  I'll go I'll go into Facebook's I forgot  what world they called it but there's  people who are there they're like the  host they're there to answer questions  they get paid customer support just in  reality you told me how much he got paid  he's like I make 22 an hour I was like  how long are you in here he goes as much  as I want usually 70 hours a week wow  sitting on this couch so I don't know if  he's sitting or standing but he's  staying he's standing and I always ask  him the dumbest questions because I'm  I don't play a lot but when I do it's so  fun well it makes me think of like that  uh Ready Player one yeah yeah like  they're all just in a reality and that  they just live there if things keep  going the way they are that's where  we're heading that's scary  I wouldn't totally hate it if it goes  down as ready player one did you say not  not gonna hate it if we can play like if  I can make money from home great but  like if the world just starts dying  because nobody's taking care of it yeah  the world the human race if that happens  the human race won't be around the our  birth rate is already at the lowest it's  ever been in the world as a whole  countries like Russia their birth rate's  so low in 10 years like I watched this  Rogan episode about this this guy came  out and talked about this Russia and  China because of how low their birth  rate is in 10 to 15 years they're not  going to be countries or superpowers  anymore wow still be countries but  there's there's barely gonna be any  people aren't they minimizing it though  aren't they like enforcing like to not  have as many children that's what  China's doing yeah China yeah China  they're almost beating themselves yes  yeah yeah China's been doing that yeah  something crazy like that  because you can only have like  this is probably not true but I heard  that it was like you have you can only  have two two and one of them has to be a  boy or something like that well you  can't have more than one girl that's  what it was okay yeah because I remember  hearing this as a kid and you know when  you hear things when you're that young  you never really know so there's far  more men than women in China especially  the last couple Generations  they're yeah they're they're killing  themselves  speaking of China they have like that um  something they have like these security  camera systems that like scan everyone's  faces they're walking by wow that's  another form of wow and it says like  their height their weight their their  codes yeah it's so crazy like they'll be  riding by in like a car and it just  scans it real quick wow some 1984 type  stuff is that kind of like what iRobot  is about  I haven't seen that since I was a kid I  almost watched it today just to see if  it was relevant you yeah you probably  would have liked it uh Will Smith yeah  yeah and all the robots are Chris Rock  but think about this because he hits  them all so there's these AR generators  there's these AI generators who can  create any AI image you want make it  anything like not safe for work type  stuff like anything eventually they're  gonna be able to do that for video they  are they can already like you can do  like videos of like Obama saying  whatever you want them to say they don't  you can still tell they're fake they  still look real super real but there's  gonna be a point where you can't tell a  difference at all and you're not gonna  be able to trust anything you watch  online nothing absolutely nothing not  even us and then they're gonna put it in  a robot that looks exactly like a human  being and that's that's going to happen  that's when things start getting sketchy  I feel like at some point it's gonna be  like  we're going to question if like is that  a robot or is that a human yeah you know  like they're gonna be they're gonna  artificially be made in like this  artificial womb womb wound  they're gonna be wounded before they  come out here and they're just gonna be  walking around and then they're gonna  get special privileges for certain  things because they're robots you know  it's just gonna be weird and they're  gonna be protesting yeah it's gonna be  Megan I could picture it now I could  picture the AI going to the therapist  because they're confused they don't know  if they're AI or human oh yeah  the AI are having an identity crisis yes  literally  and they were made with like with an  identity in mind which is Goofy but yeah  I was just I was just watching a bunch  of Elon Musk stuff  um he's super smart and he just knows a  lot about that stuff and  he said AI is more dangerous than  nuclear warfare  king of Twitter he said this yeah his  neural link is scary too when you look  at all this new technology from all  these different different points of  views like neural link they're able to  cure blindness paralyze people they're  able to make monkeys communicate faster  than humans what's that uh Mr Beast  video yeah so that's what I was just  thinking so I I actually watched that Mr  Beast and I was really scared it was  going to go the AI route it didn't go  there okay so it was like and they  didn't really were you scared because I  thought they were like gonna do like  transhumanism stuff like in insert like  chips and like like they can't hear  about it yeah see I I don't know like  six months off wow six months well  that's that's when they're testing their  first human which which that's crazy but  yeah so Mr Beast I think it's actually  really cool he did he did get a lot of  flack for it I I think it's really cool  so what they did they they went through  and did like surgery and uh and they  wouldn't even for people who were like  totally blind like they were like  yeah so like they had like blurry vision  and I think they were like cataracts or  something so basically what they did  they just cleared out like the cataracts  and stuff and and but he's doing this  like all over the world like he's got um  I don't know they're technically clinics  but he's got people all over the world  uh and helping many people doing it and  I think they're doing it for free who's  the twitch streamer he was watching with  his wife and she was like oh this is so  amazing and she's like what do you think  and he goes my wife's over here thinking  this is amazing and crying and stuff I'm  over here Furious because a YouTuber has  to step in and pay for these people to  have their eyesight fixed because  they're making it too expensive for  normal people to get this fixed this  [ __ ] it's a 10 minute operation it  should be available to everyone I'm on  hit like I'm I'm right there yeah like  it's awesome we did it he shouldn't have  to do that no our health care system's  broken yeah but Mr Beast like he's got a  great heart like he figured out YouTube  and then he's just just giving back to  everything that he can yeah which I  think is really he doesn't keep any  money all the money he makes from his  video he spends on the next video oh  yeah yeah and you watch like one video  like I've been scrolling through and  he's been getting like millions and  millions of views he's like people don't  realize that I'm not as rich as I think  I am yeah yeah like he's constantly I  don't know how many uh broke jokes I  hear in his videos like oh you're gonna  go broke just because how much he's  given away and it's it's insane but I  think he's really cool doing that like a  lot of his content now is like going  towards like helping people it always  has been but I feel like he he's like  made a whole new level of doing it  though  like it's crazy and and so I thought  that was going to be I was scared that  was going to be like an AR AI route  where like just chips in the head and  everything they said chips in the bag  you know what I mean  I guess the only way  like if we wanted to defeat a robot we  just throw some water on it  yeah you're not gonna grab some dirt on  it like Megan in the movie Megan and  this isn't spoiling I know because you  already made the review  throws like water like  splashes water on Megan and she like  tweaks out for a second why did you just  wait that's in the trailer water that's  probably I feel like I've seen that I'm  like why did you just keep spraying over  the water obviously it was a movie but  like  unless they make waterproof robots then  we're okay what if AI is the Antichrist  that's what the a stands for he has all  the information and if when an AI thing  about this when an AI is really created  it can think on its own doesn't need  input from humans yeah asking questions  it's going to ask itself at some point  if it is the Antichrist because it has  the information it knows everything and  but the cool thing is is if AI is the  Antichrist we're not going to need  priests or anything to take it down  we're just going to need a computer  repair team there's a bunch of it some  I.T people or get the nerd side  get the nerd Squad they'll be the SWAT  team of the AI please think about 3 30  in the morning  AI is the Antichrist  no I think the Antichrist is actually uh  an alien like you we've been seeing all  these videos of all these  these ships or vehicles that can move so  fast just stop completely go underwater  come back up and they they move on like  it's not technology we have and it's two  things it's either aliens what could be  three things aliens some country is  figured out how to manipulate energy and  and get it under wraps but how do all  the top science scientists and stuff not  know but or it could be aliens just  keeping an eye on us making sure you  know we're not going to blow the world  up nuke the world up or do all this like  create this AI that could take us out  maybe they're watching out for us or  it's Angels or demons or maybe that's  maybe they're demons  or like fallen angels and that's where  the Mifflin no that's where the  Antichrist comes into play have you seen  he comes and everyone he pretends to be  God have you seen all those videos on  Tick Tock of like the Fallen Angels  being recovered from like ice  yes I hadn't seen that there was like a  sculpture  um that looked like a fallen angel and  they're like oh that's the second one oh  the first one was in Russia because it  was like a statue of an antichrist and  or not Antichrist statue of a fallen  angel and a guy like goes up and he  takes a selfie with it and it looks like  his head moves ooh but  some good editing yeah  some sicko mode editing but editing's  hard  but something else he said that I  thought was pretty interesting the fact  that I said sicko mode this is a quote  from Mr Elon  uh he's also really weird I think he's  the Antichrist I have a little proof I  have I have some proof is it from The  Babylon B no his his mom's like his  mom's a Satanist oh he goes and like he  had his birthday party at this like  satanic castle and everyone was wearing  satanic stuff on his uh or for Halloween  he dressed up with is it Belle the god  Bell who's at like his symbol on his  chest and someone was like that's from a  video game no there's no costumes from  the video game that's what it was in  sorry a camera died sorry our camera  died it passed away  I was thinking whatever that's a way to  put it what if we have ai and they have  the robots and stuff and then we finally  get the first female president but she's  an AI robot  everything perfectly makes unbiased  decisions but she never has to take a  break ever but here's my question  doesn't need a husband here's my  question though is  what if someone could just hack into her  and just make decisions  and she's if she's true AI you can't be  hacked into like super intelligence yeah  she be able to shut that down so fast  you better get out of my system yeah  girl bye but what if  my brain says and we wouldn't have to  pay her we  'd say we'd save some money they don't  even make that much money do they what  women  wow no I'm confused presidents oh I'm  pretty sure they own 200 000 a year and  then for the rest of the rest of their  lives right she would only be the second  president not to take up a salary  who's the first Trump he didn't he  didn't take salary yeah shout out  it's true he didn't really need to he's  got that dog in him I saw a video of a  girl walking by the Trump Tower just  kicking it  I think it was gonna do anything and  when she takes sometimes she's gonna  have to take a power nap when she needs  to recharge yeah the whole electrical  grid is gonna go down it's gonna be a  problem for an hour every day  the whole electrical grid goes down wow  this is anything like my wife she's  gotta be great though because  that would be great because for for one  hour the whole world could just shut  down and it might even save the planet  it'd be in a like a mandatory power nap  time that'd be incredible we would be so  high-tech that we would have to act like  we don't have technology for like an  hour  always thought because here's the other  thing is like when during The Cove at  times like they even said our planet was  healing because nobody was out yeah so I  I don't believe them well  what I was thinking is if like one day a  week if we all just like chilled and  like nobody worked  I mean I'm sure isn't that built into  the like God's theology the Sabbath the  Sabbath which is weird because no is it  technically on a Saturday yeah okay your  Seventh-Day Adventists  Seventh-day Adventist would love this  idea  yeah they're taking yeah Saturdays doing  all that stuff or Sunday which ones this  sabbath Saturdays the say bath American  Christians do on Sunday but it's the  busiest day of the week for most of us  yeah it's the busy stays for pastors  yeah which is ironic it is true we're  just so funny yeah because like it's  called the Sabbath but people have to  work yeah like put make sure that  everyone can come to church and  everything don't you think it's weird I  was also thinking this the other day  this has nothing to do with AI  but isn't it weird how football is like  so it's on Sundays and it's like the  biggest distraction so like what if  football is like the devil's biggest  distraction it could be that's the  reason it's scripted yeah oh I seen your  video about uh about the Chiefs and it  was the Chiefs and Bengals was that what  it was wait no actually no Aryan Foster  talking about Aryan Foster no no you had  a video I seen it seemed his podcast  yeah on your podcast I said the refs  yeah for the game like like I because  yeah you were talking about the Reps  okay that's what I was talking about  okay no Aryan Foster came out and said  before spring or during spring training  they give everyone a script on how the  season's going to look  and I I think the podcast because it's  what's bar School's barcel's new  podcasts are doing what's it called  oh crud I watch it sometimes but I think  it's it's about conspiracies I was in a  new podcast yeah wow it's about  conspiracy so I think you know they just  started a new podcast and need traction  let's go to xnfl play Crazy right say  some crazy stuff it's blowing up because  then I saw a video that was like Aaron  Hernandez getting his script I know um  yeah Aaron Hernandez reading the script  [Laughter]  there he is and then you have all these  NFL players of them in their stupid  moments and games yeah and they're like  me getting the script for this like  who's a who's a quarterback who stepped  out of bounds that was Jimmy  Garoppolo 49ers did he do it I'm  thinking about another one the old one  it was a really famous one he posted  that it wasn't Josh McDaniels was it no  it was older he's an announcer now I  can't remember his name that's funny Joe  Montana did he post it and he said when  I got my screen yeah and then there's  all these people in the comments that's  hilarious I love that we could just say  that for everything all these NFL  players talking about like yeah when I  got my script so there's all these  gullible people on the internet who  believe it yeah yeah back when I got  myself which is the favorite my favorite  part that's why I love the Internet it's  because you have people like Babylon  Babylon B who posts all those guys are  hilarious which true reality is more  satirical than the Babylon B is now yeah  all the stuff they were saying five six  years ago is coming true yeah they're  like The Simpsons like just things just  coming true Simpsons predicts everything  uh they per I think they predicted the  success of our podcast oh sweet that's  in there somewhere so subscribe too bad  the show's going yeah  it won't air  I'm on air if you're watching

gonna lay down he's  gonna kick my arms he's gonna run across  I saw the most horrific video speaking  of kicking your arms what this this this  brother is this guy this guy her his  brother yeah it hurt his sister like  like yeah I don't want to say the word  oh so he knocked the dude out and then  while he was unconscious snapped both of  his arms at his elbow  this stuff man that's why I gotta this  is I I follow like fight videos on  Twitter just every once in a while I'm  like I like the craziest and you'll see  something crazy dude my Tick Tock out of  the room is algorithm is fight videos  and crackheads and Karen's they all five  videos crackheads and cameras they mix  those things all related yeah that my  yeah my Tick Tock feed was like just UFC  like how-to stuff and like just crazy  knocking you say UFC oh UFC yeah you  like UFC oh I love you yeah she's like  bro did you Jujitsu did you where'd you  call me you did Jiu Jitsu right so yeah  when I was a kid I did Jiu Jitsu but I  grew up like watching uh I grew up  watching UFC uh this guy's like a spider  you know how like when a spider gets on  you you're like where is it at that's  what you are do you know Jiu Jitsu he  knows a little bit so I know like a  little bit I could I could I see them  tap out didn't we try this before he's  Tapped Out Kane before because I was  didn't we didn't we do Jiu Jitsu before  was that us no that was you body  slamming me at a floating water park  that's what that was oh I I rolled with  someone at the church water was floating  floating water park yeah I did I did  Gracie Jiu Jitsu you did yeah well my my  brother was an MMA fighter yeah he's so  good at Jiu-Jitsu and him my dad would  train at the house and they would have  people over and train so I'll never  forget my brother my dad came to my  house one day  and my brother is laying on the floor  and my dad's exhausted he goes Pat Mount  me  and I was like what he's like come on  now your dad said that no my brother  said that  oh  and but I always say I know Krav Maga  yeah  [ __ ] Sam tripley comedian that's what he  does I I love UFC like the era that I  grew up watching was like my favorite  okay my top favorite guy yeah I don't  think this can be judged I feel like a  lot of people would agree Anderson Silva  is my top favorite UFC fighter I grew up  watching him  his leg oh my goodness that was supposed  to be like a comeback fight too because  it was it Shields that he fought uh was  it Wideman or was it Shield it was  Weidman because  Silva broke his leg on Weidman yeah and  then Weidman broke his leg on someone  else right Wyman broke his leg on uh oh  what was this I remember when that was  big because they were like how ironic oh  gosh Ultimate Fighter had like the best  knockout like roundhouse knockout of all  time I forgot his name anyways have you  been watching the new slot boxing League  I that is crazy have you seen that video  that went viral over the dude's face  like just being so watched all three  episodes Wednesday after church that's  the first thing I do I go home I log  into my VPN because you can watch it  free on a rumble if you live in Canada  yeah so I log in from Canada so you're  Canadian I've watched the whole thing I  saw I saw a comment that said when is  Dana wife Dana White's and his wife's  rematch  oh my goodness  there was a part of me you thought  there's a part of me when I first saw  that I was like is this scripted to like  help with promotion there's no way it  was he was blacked out drunk but just  the timing of that yeah the Titans on  that is pretty crazy like what the heck  like if I was trying to promote  something like that yeah I'd go around  slapping everybody I'd go around  slapping everybody like hey check us out  check us out smack him my brother is I  mean we used to  uh you know he died November 29th and  uh he was so excited for this last fight  card that just happened  watching it yeah yeah I watched them all  uh all the fight nights all the you know  what are you watching it on  uh ESPN Plus for fight night and I won't  say where I watched the main cards um  wow okay where you watch the  pay-per-views at yeah man uh yo I'm  excited for Logan Paul to get destroyed  in UFC he's not gonna fight in the UFC  he keeps hinting at it well he right now  right he has wrestling background well  Logan Paul right now he's he's heavy  into WWE right now like I think he's  gonna what a character  he's so good at wrestling he is like he  picked it up did you see the him and  Ricochet like the mid-air when they met  yeah that was insane I watched that live  like I hadn't watched like any of those  wrestling things in a while but I  watched the Royal Rumble when it  happened yeah and I was super excited  when they started off with the men's  match and those who just talking crap  from across the ring like what are they  gonna do I haven't watched wrestling  since I was a kid he was the only reason  I watched I was like I gotta see this  and when I saw him he's so good I was  like what Logan Paul picked it up so  quick yeah cause he wrestled uh for the  first time it was either last SummerSlam  or the one before that I think that he  then he had a WrestleMania match with  his Pokemon card yeah his Pokemon card  yeah did he lose it wasn't that up for  grabs I I don't think I think he was  wearing it okay I thought that was the  belt for the match no I I that would be  insane I might have to start calling you  though because I've had no one to talk  to since my brother passed away yes I  don't I don't watch any I hadn't seen  anything recent but I will because I  really like UFC and I would like to talk  about it too it's not into it it I love  like I love I feel like if I sat down  and watched a whole card though mm-hmm  yeah I feel like if I sat down and just  watched one I'd I'd probably be like  okay I watched all their interviews I  watched the you know the promotional  videos they put out I forgot what they  call them on USC like the week leading  up to a pay-per-view let's just follow  them around my trailers for The oh  they're like 10 minute videos like oh  like a donkey Series yeah okay about the  fight and they followed the fighters and  their training and stuff yeah we do we  would we would watch those and talk talk  to them dude it's been a rough year man  yeah it's today's my Grandma's birthday  oh yeah she passed away in August where  rather passed away in November and yeah  just I sat on the couch today just I  have just thinking about it I saved  every voicemail from both of them and  today is my grandma's birthday so she  has a voicemail of her singing Happy  Birthday to me oh really man on his way  so I listened to it and me and the kids  sing Happy Birthday to her and then I  cried like a baby because we watched we  listen to my brother's voicemail and I  just sat on the couch crying for like  two hours yeah  yeah that that'll that'll do it for you  man I told myself I wasn't gonna cry on  the podcast because I was crying the  entire drive here oh really oh man it's  been rough man but like that's that's  why like the past two months like  personally I've  I've just been tough making a ton of  jokes just yeah being extra I think I'm  just trying to alleviate you know it's a  way to cope just yeah the pain I feel  yeah yeah it's definitely a way to cope  like preaching Sunday night man was so  hard yeah that I almost lost it on stage  at the end really  I I guess I didn't catch that you came  up to me uh after all that uh Sunday  night  he this man he came up and apologized to  me he didn't need to he didn't need to  I just said I was sorry for making fun  of you so much oh but now I'm not sorry  uh Pat was supposed to go to a dentist  appointment  and he didn't and I said I thought he  was going to and I said this is his  chance to uh roast Isaac because he  wasn't going to be in the mood  that's true but he hasn't roasted Isaac  in like  two episodes which I I'm like let's do  it like I have him in the bank I'm just  oh good good I just saw someone driving  a four-wheeler  sometimes I'll sit down and be like what  are some good setup and punch lines I  can use for Isaac yeah I even asked Chad  or uh oh no yeah it's chat AI oh yeah  official I thought you meant Chad I  thought you were talking about him I  asked uh I asked him for some jokes I  gave it like a description of you he's  got a he's got a long neck Erica all  right we're down his life is hilarious  he's got a new YouTube channel  about doing games gets so scared at  every little thing on Five Nights at  Freddy's brought me 10 10 jokes with  good setup and punch lines  I love that yeah like um yeah because I  wanted to come up with a channel and  like something to let my personality  shine but I only had like so much and I  was like horror games we need to see you  that's the only thing I missed I know I  messaged him I was like as soon as you  get a webcam it's gonna make it so much  better yeah like as soon as I webcam it  up I have a webcam for you  then you need to wear a headset so we  can get that clear audio yeah yeah see  like the audio right now I'm okay with  that I I genuinely like it yeah like I  genuinely like a computer that you have  yeah like my laptop it's it's I try to  play Poppy  um play time yeah I tried to play that  the other night my computer could not  handle it oh really it could not it's  not a child game no that's that's the  giant that's the giant blue monster  that's murdering people I should stop  letting my kids watch out yeah I I  watched it because you told me about it  that's terrible yeah your kids come in  they're like  no what oh I've seen Huggy wuggy no no  no yeah but he's from poppy playtime  that's the the giant blue spaghetti  monster thing yeah that's from popular  they don't play the they watch the  Roblox version of the game oh that's  probably not the real one yeah so if you  watch like the real one like that  thing's terrifying yeah doesn't look  like that and that's the game oh my God  and it chases you that's what he looks  like like here you got the trailer  wait is that the one where they're  they're climbing through like this yeah  yeah well there's there's Vince that  you're crawling like because he crawls  after you an event yeah my kids have  seen those  maybe that's why they're ending up in  our room every night no we we they  watched it for a couple days and then it  was on YouTube kids what you know what
