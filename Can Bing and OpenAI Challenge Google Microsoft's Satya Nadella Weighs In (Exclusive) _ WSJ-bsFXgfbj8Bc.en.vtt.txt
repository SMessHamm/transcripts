 being with AI is going to completely  change what people can expect from  search we are grounded in the fact that  you know Google dominates this space I I  feel like a new race is starting  with a complete new platform technology  I'm excited for the users to have Choice  finally and a real competitive race out  there Microsoft CEO Sachin Adella  finally thinks he has what it takes to  make Bing happen and grab some search  engine market share from Google his not  so secret weapon this all started with  us an open AI coming together with  really a research agenda on moving uh  the state-of-the-art of AI forward  Microsoft is taking openai's newest  artificial intelligence model and  intertwining it with Bing's search data  so you can chat with the search engine  and get up-to-date information so the  entire point of chat GPT early on was to  just sort of show the power of the large  model and the conversational  intelligence we now have not only the  current information that you usually  expect from a search engine but you can  then have a full conversation around  that current information and all the  other information that came before on  top of the new AI chat features in bing  Microsoft is adding chat GPT like  features to its edge browser so I came  here to Microsoft's headquarters in  Redmond Washington to get a Hands-On  demo of the new tools and here nadella's  thoughts on AI  [Music]  the first big new feature Bing chat  Incorporated right into the front page  of Bing will be an ask me anything box  type in your query say the biggest  winners of the 2023 Grammys because I  did not have time to watch it and up  Pops your usual search results which  Nadella says has also been improved with  AI but more interesting is this new chat  box that will start typing out an answer  to the question as it answers it also  includes citations so you know where the  information is coming from it allows me  to then have a full-on conversation  around all the search data so yes it's  annotated it's about being able to  create even the links back to all the  Publishers so this is just search just  better the system took about a minute to  return a list of the top Grammy winners  not exactly fast but you can tell it to  stop responding then you can ask  follow-up questions like do you know if  Beyonce is touring if you're a Beyonce  fan you might want to hurry and get your  tickets before they're gone like Chachi  BT you can ask it non-search type things  too like write 10 questions for Sacha  Nadella about AI  what are the key features and benefits  of new Bing chat mode and how does it  leverage AI to enhance the user  experience it really is grounded in  search results and helps me have a very  contextual chat or to be able to get to  the right answers Sacha Bing said or AI  Satya said the new Bing chat mode  leverages AI to understand the user's  intent context you said context and  preferences to provide relevant visual  logical and actionable responses  but while these may seem like fun and  games in these demos there are of course  real misuses of this technology we have  a lot of practice uh in thinking about  safety AI is only good if it is being  used in the real world understanding  learning human preferences and our  intent is to do that which is to put  stuff out there with safety but at the  same time realizing that we are going to  have to think about safety as an ongoing  responsibility not a one-time  responsibility he also told me there are  guard rails in place to prevent harmful  content hate speech and more  the second big feature Microsoft Edge  integration the Microsoft edge browser  will now have a bing sidebar where you  can ask it to summarize a web page  you're on or ask it to generate text for  instance I asked it to so I want to  write about a letter to Sacha Nadella  thanking him for his time then I was  able to tell it I wanted it written in  an enthusiastic tone in email form and  short  it knows that's pretty good there's a  lot of fear that AI is going to take our  jobs replace us is that unfounded and  how do you think about tools like Bing  now and how we use it in the job market  like I I think of this as at the  foundational level going to help us do  our jobs better reduce some of the  drudgery in some of our jobs uh whether  it's in coding or in writing or in  automating workflow or searching for  information so at the fundamental level  I think we need a productivity boost I  feel it'll create more jobs the barriers  to knowledge work will come down so I  mean the unintended consequences around  labor market shifts are always something  we need to be mindful of but I don't  subscribe to this zero sum or one lump  of Labor fallacy and I think that we're  going to have new jobs get created and  more job opportunities and it sounds  like more time right for sure for sure  we Outsource some of this right I  outsourced some of my my question  writing to this freed up a little bit  more of my time to do something else and  but you're still in in the loop and  you're in charge because you will you  get to accept the draft that's kind of  one of the metaphors I have is pretty  much all computer interaction going  forward you'll start with a draft that  doesn't mean you don't get to inspect  the draft or prove the draft and  redefine or re you know and edit the  draft the question is which company will  write that draft for us will it be  Microsoft with tools like this or Google  which owns ninety percent of the search  engine market share and right before my  interview with Mr Nadella announced Bard  it's similar AI chat feature that will  come to its own search engine how are  you thinking about monetizing this the  last time I checked software I mean it's  a search was the most profitable  category uh there is on planet Earth so  therefore all I need is a few more users  uh and someone else that I'm competing  in has to keep all of their users and  all of their gross margin it's a lot I'm  looking forward to that so no plans to  charge for newbing it's really  advertising model all the way through  let's start there and if we if there are  other models there may be other models  but there is enough Surplus let me put  it this way there is so much Surplus  that goes to one place which I think  would be nice if it was evenly  distributed what about Microsoft Office  just stay tuned I fully expect us and uh  to introduce these capabilities quite  frankly across the length and breadth of  Microsoft what about this guy  oh you know it's sort of like it was  early and so we get to redefine it uh  for the AI age and it's going to be very  useful so is he coming back he'll come  back in a variety of different ways I  think I'm most excited about being as  the real incarnation of clippy okay but  but no actual like pop-up I think we  have much better design mechanisms to do  what clippy aspired to do back in the  day does clippy haunt your dreams not  really it's probably the thing that was  the most fun character Microsoft  introduced which you know think about it  right we have been on a 30-year journey  to perfect it so I'm excited to be here  in 2023 launching Bing with AI  foreign  [Music]
