 so I took a quick look at chat GPT this  is a new AI tool and I took a look at it  from the point of view of software  development  so this is just a preliminary look at it  and what my thoughts are in terms of how  it might affect  development and developers so the first  question will replace developers I don't  think so because  from what I've seen thus far  it looks like a very very good code  completion tool and plus plus so it does  more than a typical code completion tool  that you see in a typical code editor  IDE that you would use today but it does  more  and uh so I could see it as a  productivity tool in terms of speeding  up things so yeah it's something to  consider something to look at  don't make the mistake I made many years  ago where when I was writing Java in the  mid 90s the first two years I was  writing Java code I was like this  hardcore nerd who would just use a  simple Text Editor to write my Java code  and then I'd rather for the compiler via  command line that was a waste of time  because  when I went to an IDE especially when  jet Brands came out that was a game  changer for me at least when I went to  an IDE an integrated development  environment with very Advanced code  editing capabilities code completion all  kinds of refactoring tools built in it  made my life so much easier I became  much more productive my code was easier  to debug I had less typo related bugs  although I had more logical and  structural bugs not more but I had these  those those stayed around  so I think with a software like chat GPT  with its ability to write code for you  and so forth even answer some basic code  questions in terms of comprehension you  can I've seen examples where they select  code chunks and it's able to give you  breakdowns again  if you are an experienced developer you  know that this is only  part of the job a big part of the job as  a professional developer is able to  figure out  all kinds of architectural issues  infrastructure issues especially if  you're a lead developer where you have  to start making choices in terms of  which particular Technologies to choose  based on  some seemingly  minor nuances of your applications or of  your business's needs sometimes it might  make sense to do it with a web app  sometimes you might want to do a mobile  app native some sometimes who knows you  get the idea  so again I would not be worried that  this is going to replace developers I  think it's just going to change the game  a little bit more it's going to shift  the game just like when content  Management Systems came out like  WordPress that shifted the game when  good Ides came out that shifted the game  when they standardized web development  in around 2012 to 14 really became solid  at that point HTML5 specification and so  on that changed the game it just made it  a lot easier to get things done so  instead of working on this Developers  been much less time on this now and  could spend more time on that that's why  websites and web apps are just so much  better today because as developers as  web developer as web developers today we  don't have to spend so much time  building infrastructure trying to figure  out trying to figure out common  infrastructure issues that have been  resolved now which is a good thing so so  far based on my preliminary preliminary  look at chat GPT I don't see as a threat  I just see it as a potential tool that  you can use something to leverage take a  look at it play around with it see how  it might help you out in certain  circumstances just like a great IDE by  the way AI based code completion and  code assistance is nothing new I  actually reviewed a couple of tools in  last year which were pretty cool as well  they were I looked at them as  cold completion and code hinting on  steroids you know anyhow there you go  bye-bye  [Music]  [Music]
