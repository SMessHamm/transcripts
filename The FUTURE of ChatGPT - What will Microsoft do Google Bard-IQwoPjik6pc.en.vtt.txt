 jet GPT is the end of the internet this  is a very tall statement to make and I  think a lot of people still  underestimate what AI actually does a  lot of people think well I have a  website I need a nice text for that  website so instead of me writing that  text I have the AI write the text for me  and it's already what AI is but that is  not what AI is and this is why chat EPG  is not just ending the internet it is  also the future of the internet if you  have used chatgpt you know that is  creating answers for you specifically  for your individual question  and of course you might know that one of  the biggest investors in chat GPD is  Microsoft at the start they invested one  billion dollars into the technology then  later they invested 10 billion dollars  into that technology this is how  important that is before it is even out  there before it is even a real product  it is worth that much and actually it is  worth a lot more now let's think about  again what does jet GPT do  and why is it changing things so much  well  when you go to Bing which is the  Microsoft version of Google and you're  looking for an answer and you get the  answer right on Bing  you don't have to go to a website  anymore why would you go to a list of  pages look for the right Pages go on  that page read through the text try to  figure out the answer which is most of  the time not really what you wanted to  have as an answer and try and try to  figure out how this answer can be  applied to your problem if instead you  have an AI giving you the exact answer  that you're looking for so at that point  why would you even need a website why  would you even go to a website which  also means why would people even create  websites and put information on there if  people don't visit it anymore so the  mode on how information is coming to you  is changing in a big way and you have to  consider at that point how we consume  information and how this has changed a  lot with for example the creation of  social media with the creation of Web  2.0 as it was called before social media  now back in the day you only had  websites and if you wanted to know  something you would go on that website  for example for news you would go to BBC  to CNN any kind of other page out there  and you would to read through the  articles but you don't do that anymore  right if you consume news I'm pretty  sure most of you consume the news  through social media you go to YouTube  you go to Facebook and then you see the  headlines you read through that then you  go to the comments maybe you argue with  someone that is the consumption of news  and this is very fluent this is very  integrated in your daily life because  you have your phone all the time with  you this is why on Amazon you don't have  a form you need to go through to fill  out information you have a one-click buy  button because information needs to flow  very fast so with chat GPD the way  information flows is again changing from  needing to go out there to look for the  information to having the information  individualized come to you now at that  point let's have a look at how Bing is  actually integrating that so right now  you can't use chatgpt on Bing but they  are already presenting it to you as if  you could to prepare their community so  right now here it says ask me anything  me as if you would speak with a person  and then below that you have your  buttons to try out the AI to give you  answers now here are some examples of  how that that looks and this here is a  classic example where the question is I  need to throw a dinner party for six  people who are vegetarian can you  suggest a three course menu with a  chocolate dessert so in that case it  gives you here some suggestions on the  right side but then also these are  linking to different websites where you  can find that information so all of that  is still very classic but of course as  we know from chat GPT this is not  actually how we want to use that so here  in the second example the question is  plan me a workout for my arms and abs  with no sit-ups and no gym equipment it  should only take 30 minutes in this case  actually the AI is writing out for you a  complete training plan also describing  each of the exercises and how to do that  now there's also always links in here to  websites but you are good just reading  the text of course still this is a  classic view where we have websites here  on the left side we also have some  videos that you can use for training but  you can already imagine that these  results will not 100 fit what you're  asking for now of course in this example  because this is a Microsoft example the  first video exactly fits what we want to  have now here we have another example  where it says write code to find the  Fibonacci sequence in Python and here we  don't have any search results this is  just giving you the code and of course  as we know with chat GPT you can then  ask the AI to explain to you the code  maybe if you find errors into here to  correct the code it can give you  feedback on the code on what is going on  so you cannot just have the code but  also understand and learn how it works  and if it doesn't work in the software  where you want to use it you can ask the  AI to correct it so it fits and the AI  knows what you said before so it can go  back and actually correct its own errors  and even make statements on these errors  of course when we scroll down here you  can see that still we have search  results down here in a classic way as  you would find on Google but the main  screen up here is occupied by just Dai  and just the answers and of course you  would go on with the conversation  because not only is that information  more individualized to whatever you  specifically need but also because you  are in a direct conversation with an  artificial person and this helps you  much more than a static text on the  internet so what is the overall meaning  of that one thing you can see here very  clearly is that static information is a  thing of the past you won't go through  texts or books or just long lines of  information anymore that are filled with  things that your act really don't want  to look at that you're not actually  searching for and this is exactly how  the flow of information is going to  happen in the future you get exactly the  bit you need and then and only then when  you need something more you ask the AI  to give you additional information and  this brings me to the final statement of  this video because the age that we're in  right now is called the age of  information because what we do is  handling information so when you think  about the past of the other stages of  our society we had a agriculture stage  where we went out and actually work with  our hands on the field then you had an  industrial stage where you would work  still with your hands but in production  holes on production bands but this was  then also done by machines so now most  of the people out there they work in  skyscrapers just handling information  for customers for orders for all of the  processes that are going on and of  course the internet that we have right  now is a huge pool of information most  of it in long form text now chat GPT is  the end of that because we get the  information where we need it and how we  need it so this brings us basically from  an age of information to an age of  curation because you get the information  you need you have to decide what  information you need and what to do with  that and of course the AI can help you  also do these things and your  involvement in most of that information  flow is just to decide what is going to  happen next now you might think well  this is taking the creativity and the  Ingenuity out of everything but it is  not really the case because think about  for example like a film one of the most  important persons in a film is the  director of the movie because even  though he isn't doing anything in the  project other than directing and all of  of the other people on the team do  everything else all the vision all the  creative decisions everything that  brings this complete project together  and makes it into an artwork is coming  through the decisions of the director so  this is where the future of chat GPT is  heading with Microsoft and we will see  what other Solutions companies like  Google have with the Bard let me know in  the comments what you think about that  leave a like if you enjoyed this video  and see you soon bye oh you're still  here so uh This is the End screen  there's other stuff you can watch like  this or that's really cool and yeah I  hope I see you soon leave a like if you  haven't yet and well  um yeah
