 this right here is called chat GPT it is  an ai2 recently released by open AI so  it's said to do things that makes your  work life easier for example we can give  it an instruction to say explain Quantum  Computing in simple terms and it's going  to do that and also does things like  coding for Developers for example I  could give it a task to solve or tasks  to code and it's going to do that for me  well I want to test in this video is for  example as a developer instead of  searching on Google for let's say basic  bugs or how to do certain things what if  you could just ask chat GPT right here  so let's test that so for example let's  say I want to see how to create let's  see a python code to perform a binary  search so let's try that what if I say  write a python code  to perform a binary search  so as you can see right here it says  here is an example of a binary search  implementation in Python  very quick and you know it gives us this  response in real time which makes it  good  and it gives us an explanation of  everything that we need this is actually  very cool you know I'm very sick because  you know this is basically what we need  I could just copy this code and paste it  in my in my code editor so let's try  something else let's say  write a python code  to perform a bubble  search now let's see what it does it  says here is an example of a bubble  sorting presentation in Python this is  very good as you can see it is  fascinating on how quick it writes it  and how accurate this is so we can  actually test this I'm just going to  copy this code and what I'm gonna do I'm  gonna go to  this python IDE right here and I'm going  to run it  so let's see if this is actually if this  actually works so as you can see it gave  it in this number list and using bubble  sort it sorted it giving us one two  three four five six seven eight  it's very good and this is all words  chat GPT did
