 foreign  have you ever dreamed of a world where  you could press a button and your  homework would be automatically written  for you or maybe you've been heads down  studying and just wished you could ask  your computer to write out the answer  rather than having to spend hours and  hours Googling and looking through your  books well there are now lots of AI  powered writing apps out there and  essentially what they do is they use  artificial intelligence to help you  write faster and more accurately and  there are also more and more note-taking  apps that are using AI such as mem  notion chican and logsuk while AI  writing apps are incredibly useful for  writers and creators to generate content  fast AI note-taking apps are great for  noting down new things in general but  just how helpful are they for actually  learning a topic well with chat GPT  picking up a million new users in the  first few days of launching I wanted to  share with you some of my thoughts on  what generative AI means for Learning  and studying and why you don't want to  sleep on AI if you're studying for exams  so hit that subscribe button and let's  get going  [Music]  okay so genitive AI is a type of  artificial intelligence that can create  new things like images text and even  music based on the prompts that you give  it open AI is a company that's been  working on AI algorithms since 2014 and  their tax-based AI is called GPT which  stands for generative pre-train  Transformer and this allows for a small  amount of input text to generate large  volumes of relevant and sophisticated  machine generated content what's cool is  you can give GPT any kind of prompt and  then receive a large volume of pretty  accurate tax back openai also has an  image generating algorithm called Doorly  that can create images from nothing and  a code generating algorithm that can  actually output lines of functioning  code which is pretty wild what's  interesting is that open AI is a  commercial company that charges the  amount of text or images generated and  its algorithms like GPT get smarter and  more accurate as more and more people  use it for different functions and it  becomes better trade now open AI isn't  specific to any particular industry or  to studying and so lots of apps and  companies have popped up which use GPT  or Doorly at their core but provide a  specific interface like a copywriting  app such as Jasper or a photo creation  app like lenser where you can upload  your own photos and get some pretty fun  images back or note-taking apps and  learning apps like mem chican notion and  logsec so how do those help you  if we focus down on note-taking and  learning apps How can AI like GPT be  used for studying and will it help us to  learn well AI has a number really  interest functions that some apps have  been already taking advantage of  [Music]  us like grammarly and quill bot have  been using GPT similar algorithms to  speed up grammar correction and  simplifying pros this is really helpful  if you struggle with writing and these  apps not only spot spelling and  grammatical errors but you can actually  use them to rephrase and simplify  content which is really great if you're  trying to simplify and teach others or  if you just want to optimize how you  write in general  now one big issue of teachers when  creating exams or tasks is that actually  thinking about the questions and writing  them out can take time if you're a  student accessing questions to test  yourself and creating your own active  recall questions or flashcards is also  really really time consuming and it's  often difficult to understand the right  difficulty level to set these at with  things like open ai's chat GPT interface  you can actually ask the AI to write you  out its own questions and these will be  generated in a fraction of the time  while they're not always specifically  accurate they do save you time and if  you're looking to create a lot of  questions quite quickly they're really  fun to have a play around with now  multiple choice questions are often used  in exams as they test our higher order  thinking because we have to select the  correct answer from a selection of  answers that are quite similar to the  right one  with things like question generation  algorithms previously it was easy to  pick out the correct answer if you input  a load of text but it was actually  difficult for the AI to pick out  distractor questions which is similar to  that right answer with the latest  generation of algorithms however this  seems to be less of a problem when I  tried creating my own questions it  actually came up with some pretty good  distractor questions but this will  obviously be less useful for things like  Madsen where you actually need to work  through a clinical case the release of  chat GPT with its more conversational  text message style of interface has  meant that GPT accessibility is now much  much easier instead of having to write  specific or very technical prompts to  get the best answers you can now have a  conversation just like Tony Stark's AR  Jarvis often if I'm deeply focused it  can be distracting having Google and  validate explanations to any problems  I'm working on searching through  textbooks for explanation so that you  can understand can also be really really  frustrating with chat GPT you can  literally ask it to explain anything  complex in simple terms a bit like  having a tutor on demand 24 7. this  obviously has some limitations with the  more complex topics like medicine and  you do need to be careful about how  accurate the information is but as an  equivalent to a quick Google search it's  pretty comprehensive and it reduces  distractions because you don't need to  jump out of apps like notion or ma'am to  then go into Google or switch your  Chrome tabs and that means that you're  more focused on what you're working on  at that moment okay if we jump into chat  GPT we can see that we can type in  pretty much anything we like and then  the AI will give us a response so in  terms of learning what things might we  do well we might want to analyze a  specific topic just to kind of remind  ourselves so let's say  can you summarize  [Music]  GCSE biology photosynthesis  [Music]  gives us a really nice breakdown and  simple explanation of what  photosynthesis is if we're studying GCSE  Biology one of the really cool things  about chat GPT and GPT in general is  that you can specify the language that  he uses to Output any text or  information so I can say make it more  complicated make it simpler make it more  specific and with the chat interface of  chat GPT I can actually do follow-on  questions so I can say tell me more  about glucose  and this is really easy to use  conversational style now another thing  we might want to do if we're trying to  create lots and lots of active recall  questions is to generate them on mass  which if doing ourselves might take a  lot of time in terms of note-taking  itself the AI can provide prompts to  help you quickly write things and not  lose your train of thought  its advantage of this is it's not  necessarily your own work with the  prompts coming from the AI  another thing that the arrow is helpful  with is actually summarizing large  pieces of text  you can all stay like to summarize five  key things from what you've input  already all from your existing notes all  from lecture slides and it will do that  the problem here is are we actually  deeply learning and are we using note  taking in the correct way well as you  know I won't really take any notes  instead I'll use active recall questions  as I go through a lecture textbook or  video to write down anything I'm not  sure about and to create questions that  then test my knowledge remember if we  use active recall it's forcing us to use  our long-term knowledge and pull  information out to make sure that we  understand it and understand it in  detail when I go through things I'm  always thinking can I explain this in  simple terms how well do I know this  what bits of information am I missing  and then I'll actively go and find this  out by diving into the textbook by  diving into another video and adding to  my notes over times while it might seem  at surface level like AI is going to  completely revolutionize note-taking and  automate everything that probably isn't  the best thing for studying and learning  and so as more of these apps integrate  AI you need to be a little bit cautious  in how you're testing yourself and  ensuring that any notes you take are  personalized to you and you're really  testing yourself at every step of your  note-taking journey if we look at how  note-taking apps like logsec notion or  ma'am are actually trying to integrate  AI into their existing products a lot of  it is aimed at content creators they  allow you to create a blog post they  allow you to write something and  automate this from templates but a lot  of it is geared to that content and  generation of that new information to  save people time it's not really focused  on studying the the best uses within  these apps is actually around grammar  correction paraphrasing and summarizing  things you might have already written  out to again save you time but nothing  here is really going to help you learn  unless you're generating questions or  you're utilizing it in a way which is  really testing any existing knowledge  for example you might want to ask an AI  write me a question on photosynthesis or  write me a question on biology or  explain to me something in biology in  simple terms if you're really struggling  with the topic the AI can simplify and  break things down but remember you might  need to go to multiple sources to really  make this stick and pull on the threads  to go through that Learning Journey  where you're going from knowing nothing  at all about a new topic to really  understanding it in detail and then  reading around the topic to more deeply  understand it now if you enjoyed this  dive into AI I've actually got a number  of videos on note-taking apps and how I  take notes which I'll put up here in the  end chords for you to dive into thanks  so much for watching thanks so much  subscribing to the channel do
