 AI predictions for 2023  gpt4 will be released in the next couple  months and yes it will be a big deal  rumors have been flying recently about  gpt4 the next generation of openai's  powerful generative language model  expect gpt4 to be released early in the  new year and to represent a dramatic  step change performance Improvement  relative to GPT 3 and 3.5  as manic is the recent hype around chat  GPT has been it will be a mere Prelude  to the public reaction when gpt4 is  released buckle up  perhaps counter-intuitively we predict  that it won't be much larger than its  predecessor gpt3  in an influential research paper  published earlier this year deepmind  researchers determined that today's  large language models are in fact larger  than they should be for optimal model  performance given a finite compute  budget today's model showed a fewer  parameters but train on larger data sets  training data in other words Trump's  model size  most of today's leading language models  were trained on data corpuses of about  300 billion tokens including openai's  gpt3  it is possible that gpt4 will be  multimodal that is that it will be able  to work with images videos and other  data modalities in addition to text  this would mean for example that it  could take the text prompt as input and  produce an image like Dolly does or take  a video as input and answer questions  about it via text  we are going to start running out of  data to train large language models  it has become a cliche to say that data  is the new oil  this analogy is fitting in one  underappreciated way both resources are  finite and at risk of being exhausted  the area of AI for which this concern is  most pressing is language models  for the first time some members of the  general public will begin using fully  driverless cars as their day-to-day mode  of transportation  after years of premature hype and  unfulfilled promises in the field of  autonomous vehicles something has  happened recently that surprisingly few  people seem to have noticed truly  driverless cars have arrived  today as a member of the general public  you can download the cruise app it looks  just like the Uber or Lyft app and hail  its driverless vehicles with no one  behind the wheel to take you from point  A to point B on the Streets of San  Francisco  proof currently only offers these  driverless rides at night between 10 pm  and 5 30 a.m but the company is poised  to make the service available 24 7  throughout San Francisco  expect this to happen within weeks  in 2023 Rama taxi services will rapidly  transition from a fascinating novelty to  a viable convenient even mundane way to  get around the city  the number of robot axes on the road and  the number of people who use them will  surge  in short autonomous vehicles are about  to enter their commercialization and  scaling phase  search will change more in 2023 than it  has since Google went mainstream in the  early 2000s  search is the primary means by which we  navigate and access digital information  it lies at the heart of the modern  internet experience  today's large language models can read  and write with a level of sophistication  that a few years ago would have seemed  inconceivable  this will have profound implications for  how we search in the wake of chat GPT  one reconceptualization of search that  has gotten a lot of attention is the  idea of conversational search why enter  a query and get back a long list of  links the current Google Experience if  you could instead have a dynamic  conversation with an AI agent in order  to find what you are looking for  efforts to develop humanoid robots will  attract considerable attention funding  and talent  several new humanoid robot initiatives  will launch  the humanoid robot is perhaps a  definitive symbol of Hollywood's  exaggerated dramatized depiction of  artificial intelligence think ex machina  or I Robot  well humanoid robots are fast becoming a  reality why build robots shaped like  humans  for the simple reason that we have  architected much of the physical world  for humans  if we plan to use robots to automate  complex activities in the world in  factories shopping malls offices schools  the most effective approach is often for  those robots to have the same form  factor as the humans that would  otherwise be completing those activities  this way robots can be deployed in  diverse settings with no needs to the  surrounding environment to be adapted  Tesla has catalyzed the field of  humanoid robotics this year with the  launch of its Optimus robot which  debuted at the company's AI day in  September Elon Musk has said that he  believes the Optimus robot will  eventually be worth more to Tesla than  its entire car business  Tesla's robot still has a long way to go  before it is ready for prime time but  don't underestimate the rapid progress  that the company is capable of when it  devotes its full resources to the task  the number of research projects that  build on or cite Alpha fold will surge  deepmind's Alpha full platform first  announced in late 2020 solved one of  life's great Mysteries the protein  folding problems  Alpha fold is able to accurately predict  the three-dimensional shape of a protein  based solely on its one-dimensional  amino acid sequence a landmark  achievement that had eluded human  researchers for decades  we have previously argued in this column  that Alpha fold represents the single  most important achievement in the  history of artificial intelligence  do you find Google brain and or open AI  will undertake efforts to build a  foundation model for robotics  the term Foundation model introduced  last year by a team of Stanford  researchers refers to a massive AI model  trained on Broad swaths of data that  routed and being built for a specific  task can perform effectively on a wide  range of different activities  Foundation models have been a key driver  of recent progress in AI  today's Foundation models are  breathtakingly powerful  but whether they are text generating  models like gpt3 or text to image models  like stable diffusion or models for  computer actions like Adept they operate  exclusively in the digital Realm  AI systems that act in the real world  example autonomous vehicles warehouse  robots drones humanoid robots have so  far remained mostly Untouched by the New  Foundation model paradigm
