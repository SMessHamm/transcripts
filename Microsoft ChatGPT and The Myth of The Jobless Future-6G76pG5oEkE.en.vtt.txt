 Microsoft just announced a 10 billion  dollar investment in chat gbt maker open  Ai and this comes just as the tech firm  is laying off thousands of employees  along with Google which is doing the  same thing in order to clear the way for  more investments in Ai and that has a  lot of people saying you see artificial  intelligence is going to take  everybody's job it's going to put us all  out of work get Andrew Yang in here  let's start paying everybody two  thousand dollars a week to do nothing  well not so much history is absolutely  full of examples of disruptive  Technologies displacing hundreds  thousands even millions of workers and  yet people have always managed to find  something productive to do with their  time that is except these guys and with  that we are going to shrink my big melon  overhead and let's take a look at this  article Microsoft announces  multi-billion dollar investment in chat  GPT maker open AI Microsoft announced a  new multi-year multi-billion dollar  investment with the artificial  intelligence lab the investment is the  third phase of the partnership following  Microsoft's previous investments in 2019  and 2021 and Microsoft said the renewed  partnership will accelerate  breakthroughs in Ai and help both  companies commercialize Advanced  Technologies now keep in mind Microsoft  just laid off 10 000 people in order to  cut costs and right now Microsoft is  investing a million dollars for every  person they just laid off into Chachi PT  they are taking this seriously because  they see value there and Google did the  same thing just three days ago here we  go on January 20th alphabet Cuts 12 000  jobs after pandemic hiring spree and  refocuses on AI now for a couple years  now a lot of people have been  forecasting economic Doom and Gloom  saying artificial intelligence was going  to come in it was going to be this  revolutionary technology it was going to  displace millions and millions of jobs  everybody was going to be unemployed  we're all going to be broken it was  going to be economic Calamity and of  course the only natural solution was  this modern monetary Theory Keynesian  nonsense about everybody gets ten  thousand dollars a month and a pony for  free and poof prosperity for everyone  now there's one fundamental flaw with  this theory that AI is going to make us  all unemployed it assumes that people  will be unable to find something useful  or valuable to do with their time and  while I may not be known for my eternal  optimism and overwhelming faith in  humanity I would like to think most  people will figure out some way to make  a living even if AI comes along and  takes their job and this would not be  the first time something like this  happened let's rewind a few hundred  thousand years it's the Ice Age the very  first Homo sapiens are walking around in  the world one hundred percent of the  population is engaged in  hunter-gathering for a living literally  every human being on the planet spent  every day all day just trying to find  enough food to survive one more day so  they could wake up and do it all over  again that was everyone's job a few  hundred thousand years ago now those  cavemen could never have imagined a farm  where one guy could actually manipulate  the ground into producing the food and  so he didn't need to go out with a spear  and fight a woolly Mammoth or a  saber-toothed tiger he could just make  the food come right up out of the ground  now because farming came along and it  displaced a lot of those  hunter-gatherers does that mean all the  other cavemen just suddenly became  sedentary and they sat around and  Humanity entered into a great malaise  and the whole species just became  lethargic of course not people found  better things to do with their time all  of a sudden we had things like home  builders Carpenters people realized well  I don't have to spend all day fighting  the saber-toothed tiger to eat maybe now  I can build a house out of wood or out  of rocks or bricks or mortar or clay or  anything we don't have to live in caves  anymore now people have more time to do  other things entire new Industries  sprang up cities were built and even  those people say the farmer in ancient  Samaria the guy who put all the cavemen  out of work he could have never imagined  a big John Deere combine with GPS Guided  by satellites that does the work of ten  thousand men in a field so now that  farmers are that productive all the  ancient Sumerians were all put out of  work did they all just sit down and  become lethargic and just slowly die off  no again people found something valuable  and useful to do with their time now to  be sure disruptive Technologies are  known as disruptive because they disrupt  they make a mess they do put people out  of work all the cavemen did get put out  of work but eventually they found  something else to do with their time the  one thing though is disruptive  Technologies do tend to bring big  increases in productivity and prosperity  that increases the overall quality of  life for people that is a good thing  that's not something to be feared think  about how many people right now are  engaged in some kind of career that has  to do with music or film or TV or art a  few hundred thousand years ago every  single one of them would have been  forced to be a hunter-gatherer and try  to figure out a way to just eat another  day now we've got an entire industry  that has sprang up all for the sole  purpose of providing people with  enjoyment something we never used to  have any time for if it wasn't for those  advances in technology that made that  industry possible well we wouldn't have  things like the rings of power okay  maybe that wasn't best example but you  catch my drift now I've used chat GPT a  couple of times and it's pretty  impressive and I'm sure with more r d  it's going to become even more so and  I'm sure it is going to displace a lot  of human jobs and I'm sure for those  humans whose job is displaced it's going  to be very uncomfortable and very  inconvenient and their life will be  thrown into chaos but I have faith in  those people that they will figure out  something to do with their time that  will be useful and that will add value  to society and that all of these people  won't just in Mass all of a sudden  become a burden on society and that we  need to print more money and give them  Universal basic income in order to  support them so long story short AI will  automate certain tasks but it will also  create new jobs and industries  additionally many jobs involve tasks  that AI can perform such as creativity  and emotional intelligence finally  there's the possibility for AI to  augment human workers making them more  efficient and capable in their roles  overall while some jobs may be displaced  by AI it's unlikely that it will result  in widespread job loss oh and one more  thing everything I've said since long  story short was actually written by chat  GPT I asked the AI to explain why AI  won't put everyone out of work in 100  words or less and that's the paragraph  that it's been out for me adapt or die  people till next time live small and  dream big
