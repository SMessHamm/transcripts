 Artificial Intelligence is the set of technologies, as we all know, that allow machines to actually think, allow them to simulate cognitive processes that are characteristic of the human species, such as learning and also the resolution of more complex problems. In my opinion, Artificial Intelligence is  Probably the most powerful tool that human beings have created in recent years because it enhances our intellectual capacity to levels I previously imagined. It is true that now it is a topic that is current precisely because of the tool that you comment on in the chat, but this  It is a tool that is not so new because it was invented in the 50s in the United States at the Darmouz conference, since then a path of sustainable development began at its speed until in the 90s Well, the confluence of  two factors that are good because they produced an exponential development of this  ta Artificial Intelligence these two factors were fundamentally the data the data that is still the gasoline that feeds this combustion engine that is artificial intelligence and as we all know at the beginning of this century with social networks internet of course to hyperconnectivity with mobiles, because we have entered an era of generating millions of trillions of data daily, in addition, technologies emerged that with a reasonable cost allowed us to process, store, but also analyze this data to extract insight to extract information. This is what was called Big  Data and it is from Then when an extraordinary development of artificial intelligence begins to the point that it is currently embedded in all the most daily and routine activities of our day to day we are surrounded by smart devices from the mobile in which  Well, we unlock the mobile with  n biometrics Well, we can take photos we can fill in a text Well, with artificial intelligence tools but also our car the virtual assistants that we all use Syria Alexa the GPS to take us to different directions the television platform that offers us movies etc. at the company level too  There are sectors that have been diametrically transformed with artificial intelligence, for example, medicine, medicine. Well, artificial intelligence has been the best ally of the latest great medical advances that have occurred, which in fact are already allowing lives to be saved, artificial intelligence has allowed  Well, what is a much more preventive medicine, an early and much more precise diagnosis of diseases and the development of personalized drugs or even vaccines in much shorter periods of time than before, so well, artificial intelligence has also been fundamental in the agriculture in cybersecurity in what is the energy sector in multiple success stories that we currently have but it has always been a more discreet and more useful way, the appearance of the launch of this tiny chat is what has caused an earthquake of reactions and  has put this topic in maximum duality because it takes conversational intelligence to that interaction between the machine and the human being to a level not seen before this is a tool It is a super Bot a chatbot developed by the openiye company that allows on the one hand the machine to understand what is any question requested by the human being in its natural language, not a programming language, and then in turn the machine generates an answer that is original, that has not been previously programmed, and that is the result of everything that has gone  Learning over the last few years, this means that we have moved from analytical Artificial Intelligence to Artificial Intelligence.  artificial generative content generator with greater creativity that is why although we are only at the beginning, in fact work is already being done on the gpt version point 4 and I play four point and a half. Well, it does not stop having an important impact on the social paradigm  from how we learn from how our educational system is, even from how we generate non- content. For this reason, I do believe that it is fundamental and that we must establish as a priority agreeing on how this good tool is going to be used legitimately by human beings in the medium term Intelligence  Artificial intelligence is a unique opportunity for our companies. I believe that it will be decisive for the future viability and competitiveness of our businesses. It is true that, as you say, the first case of use, let's say almost evident, is that it will increase productivity, efficiency  in our companies and therefore it will mean cost savings Why Because it will allow us or  Optimizing processes will allow us to identify errors, as well as automate tasks, but I also believe that artificial intelligence will allow us to generate new business opportunities. Why? Because it will help us make much more informed decisions, we will be able to know the behavior of  our resource consumption processes of how our customers behave in the end, because we will be able to make much more predictive and accurate business decisions as well, and I believe that this is going to be significant, it will take the company's relationship with customers to another level  because it will allow us to offer our clients a customer experience but also a much more personalized value proposition and much more in line with their needs and with their expectations in the end, so I definitely believe that artificial intelligence must be a priority for  for all companies and it will undoubtedly become a palan  The strategic ca fundamental for the development of our businesses was not an interesting question. I believe that the future remains to be seen. Actually, it is difficult to give an answer with certainty because this is a technology that is in full development, as we have seen, and is far from being consolidated.  We are really only seeing the tip of the iceberg of what the evolution of Artificial Intelligence can be, however it is true that the latest events such as the discovery or launch of the charge ppt have put old debates on the table again. if machines with artificial intelligence can become or transform from allies to enemies of the human species I believe that this is a somewhat apocalyptic vision fueled by science fiction books and movies and I want to be optimistic my answer if I have to  only one answer is that I believe that it will not be the case. I think that the reasons are fundamentally two, the first is that intelligence is good, the very nature of artificial intelligence is true, artificial intelligence is still an intelligence that learns from existing data and it is true that in recent years they have made great progress, especially in replicating and  simulate the rational intelligence of the human being, however, I believe it is difficult and I hope that it is impossible for machines to acquire certain attributes that are unique to our human species and that are essential to create something new to invent to take our intellectual thinking to another level, these attributes by  For example, critical thinking, judgment, common sense, the ability that human beings have, not to adapt to transfer knowledge from one subject to another. As I have said, I believe that this is difficult to be acquired by the machines that they will need in  this process of learning and simulation of the human intellect because of the man  re behind the second reason is that as I said it is a technology that is far from being consolidated therefore we have time we have time to reflect as a society what will be the use of this technology and above all to act responsibly and proactively And Define together as a society, fundamentally, technology companies and also the regulator to adopt a code of conduct that regulates and guarantees the ethical and moral use of Artificial Intelligence that puts man at the center and that guarantees, of course, both their rights  fundamental legal certainty as well as that it is a tool that will help the human being, I really believe that in this you are seeing many advances in fact, Europe is leading and leading as a leader in what is trusted artificial intelligence at the international level responsible because in any case I think it is vital that we guarantee an ethical use of the Intel artificial force and also say that I believe that this has already happened in the past, it is true that it is essential to face the great technological advances and this is undoubtedly more from a sense of opportunity than from fear of the unknown. Well, I think  Undoubtedly, companies are aware that Artificial Intelligence is a source of progress for economic growth and, ultimately, social welfare. It is true that the rate of adoption in companies has perhaps been slower than expected, fundamentally for what On the one hand, we have commented on a lack of knowledge, on the other hand, there was also a lack of that solid foundation of a trustworthy Artificial Intelligence without transparent biases that could be explainable. Here, a lot of progress has been made in recent years and I think that this will help in the medium term, well, since artificial intelligence in companies grows significantly and a factor that has been decisive also in  This speed of adoption is that it is talent. Talent I believe that there is a deficit of digital talent and it has undoubtedly been a challenge for companies, on the one hand, to incorporate profiles that are more technological or data scientists or programmers or cybersecurity experts.  This has been a certain handicap for companies to face their digital transformation. Likewise, what is training in basic digital skills? To all of our teams and to all of our workforce, a factor that I believe is essential to be able to convert and transform and  digitalize our processes with all this, however. Well, I think that the data we handle is that the adoption of artificial intelligence will continue to multiply year after year, it is expected that in the coming years it will increase by approximately 40%. Spain is around  a five percent adoption in what is the large company, the tier 2 that  We call This is a little behind some European countries. However, at the country level, incorporating the entire productive fabric, we are around 7%, which is in the average for the European Union. True, the great pending issue is always SMEs in general.  Well, as I said, we are going to continue investing in digitization and also in what is the incorporation of artificial intelligence and I think that we must have a certain sense of urgency in the positive that we have a unique opportunity now we are, of course  with the next generation funds and I think that it is a great opportunity for companies to incorporate what digital tools are and also for a country to become a benchmark in Artificial Intelligence throughout Europe it is a future of Progress it is a future of contributing  great benefits to companies but also to society as such. However, it is a tool that has a lot of  potential that is not exempt from risks and for them as for this reason as a society we must, as I have said, not proactively agree on what will be a legitimate and also ethical use of this great technology
