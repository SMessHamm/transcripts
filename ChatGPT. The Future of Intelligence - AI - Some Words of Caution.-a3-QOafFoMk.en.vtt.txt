 thank you for subscribing to the channel  it's much appreciated for those who  haven't subscribed yet only take you a  second and it'd be much appreciated  don't forget hit the notification Bell  for more videos and like this video if  you would please  and share this channel that would be a  great help too  now I'm all wrapped up here because it's  um  well you know what date it is but it's  freezing here in the UK and it's early  in the morning  and I'm at home so  yeah the beauties of uh working from  home on I mean one of them is  something he goes all the way to the  floor almost  and yeah it's quite snug so what I want  to talk to you about today is chat GPT  [Applause]  foreign  GPT well it's sort of The Sibling from a  bigger program a more commercial program  and  you can put questions to it you can ask  it something and it will give you what  it thinks is the answer now the problem  with it is it's been programmed  obviously it's not  um sentient or it's not um  it's not conscious  of what it's doing it's it's been  programmed it's been told how to react  how to respond by people  um certain people so  you can't always get the right answer  from it now one of the dangers of that  you know if you're doing say a book  where it doesn't really matter if you  are if you are wrong it's not going to  hurt anyone  but if they say for instance you want to  do a you want a medical question  and it gives you an answer you can't  really trust it at this stage  um can would you be able to trust it in  the future yeah no doubt I I think it'll  it'll develop in such a way  that it will be hard to distinguish a  doctor's answer uh from what it's it's  it's giving out from  um an artificial intelligence  uh answer and that's quite scary it's  um it's kind of a weird a weird thing  it's impressive for sure and it's in a  beta kind of version at the moment so  it's free to use  and it can get really busy  chat GPT is  just one of many there'll be a lot  there'll be as soon as people realize as  soon as people get onto the fact that  it's a huge money spinner there'll be  all kinds doing it  and it's dangerous in my view it's great  fun you know it's a good it's a great  idea and then and it's the way the  future is coming unfortunately  um well fortunately depending on how you  look at it but you've got to rely on  that now when you take an article from  the internet  and it or or a recipe or an instruction  for doing some Plumbing or whatever else  you can actually  um you've got more of a reason to  believe that if there's a chat at the  end of it for instance and people are  discussing the issue and you've got  professional plumbers you know piping up  and saying well look you know do not do  your plumbing like that or you don't fit  your gas pipes like that but you can see  where I'm going with this now I'll just  read off what they first say we've  trained a model we've trained a model  see this is the this is the the um  this is the issue you know if I trained  a model  um  uh some sort of some form of AI to deal  with your with books say you're taking  how I want it to think  um how I want it to react  I should say how I want it to to  put in the next words from a series of  short words  and come up with a whole story maybe I'm  telling you how to do that and this is  this is the real issue you know we  trained a model called chat GPT which  interacts in a conversational way the  dialogue format makes it possible for GP  for chat GPT to answer following Quest  follow-up questions admit its mistakes  well I mean I don't know how that would  work so for instance if I put in  um how to play basketball  and  it makes a mistake just automatically  answer oops I've made a mistake no I  don't think so and well I haven't seen  that  so when does it  admit its mistakes does it have to you  know could you put it through again  so it's it's a funny one isn't it it  will challenge incorrect premises  and reject inappropriate requests well  you know that's fair enough but again  who's deciding what is inappropriate  chat gbt is a sibling model to instruct  DPT  which is trained to follow  an instruction in a prompt and provide a  detail response  now  let's have a little look at some of the  facts  now I've just put in a simple question  how much does it cost well during this  initial research preview check GPT is  free to use  so I'm presuming you can just keep going  and going and going  um whereas for instance in Canberra  their AI magic right  is uh Limited  so can you use it the same way yeah you  can you can use it exactly the same way  as as magic right and is it better well  I think it's going to be to be honest  with you I think it's going to be quite  good but you know magic right and those  magic document tools are integrated into  canvas so it's easy just to access from  there and again  that's in a trail kind of beta version  you know they're allowing four mistakes  and you can't really do anything about  it if someone had been harmed by what  you've put down on paper  now should you use it for  searching for keywords and things like  that well yeah I mean it's harmless you  know you're not going to hurt anyone  um but is it going to be is it going to  give you the right keywords  um  it might do  but you're best doing that yourself  you're best putting you're blaming  yourself if you get it wrong you're  better off learning how to do all this  stuff yourself before uh putting it down  in your in your production  but um I wouldn't rely if I was to put  in yeah give me some give me a dozen  keywords for this uh or give me the  right categories for that uh you know or  a different category I wouldn't be able  to trust it I would have to use and you  shouldn't trust it  because it's on even beta anyway and  it's taking no responsibility for the  mistakes it's made and it actually says  you know it's going to make mistakes  or the likelihood is it's going to make  mistakes  chat GPT is fine-tuned from GPT 3.5 a  language model trained to produce text  Tech gbt was optimized for dialogue by  using reinforcement learning and human  feedback  rlhf it's actually a thing a method that  uses human demonstrations to guide the  model towards desired Behavior  desired Behavior this is lots of things  lots of words the way they word things  in this in these things this artificial  integral intelligence we're not going to  get away from it this is the future of  you know like I say unfortunately or  fortunately  I prefer a little human interaction  foreign  but it's going to be hard at some point  to distinguish  from a real human  and a computer  you know or something online  why does the AI seem so real and  lifelike let's see that's that's the  question that you want to ask anyway  isn't it these models were trained on  vast amounts of data from the internet  written by humans so the responses it  provides may sound human-like  it's important to keep in mind that this  is a direct result of systems design  maximizing the similarity between  outputs and the data set the models are  trained on and the important bit at the  end of that paragraph is such outputs  may be inaccurate untruthful and  otherwise misleading at times it says  chat TPT is not connected to the  internet  it's learned from the internet that's  saying in the previous paragraph but  it's not connected to the internet  and it can occasionally produce  incorrect answers which is a funny one  isn't it it's pretty vague right there  it has limited knowledge of world and  events after 2021  and may also occasionally produce  harmful instructions or biased content  we'd recommend checking whether  responses from the model are accurate or  not if you find an answer is incorrect  please provide but please provide that  feedback  by giving it a thumbs down  but again see that's your opinion  you know you might be right and it's  still your opinion going against its  opinion and it's a real model  it's just it's scary isn't it it's fun  as well it's fun to use  because you're going to get some real  right answers on it you're going to get  something you're going to get a lot of  truthful things there you're going to  get a lot of but if you want if it's if  you're going to rely on it for your  business  um or for other people's health  um our safety then you can't at this  stage we simply go to the home page  which is openai.com  and we click try chat GPT we're given  this page  we give an examples explain Quantum  Computing in simple terms got any  creative ideas for a 10 year old  birthday how do I make an HTTP request  in JavaScript  limitations  May occasionally generate incorrect  information May kindly occasionally  produce harmful instructions or biased  content  limited knowledge of the world after  2021 so let's type in  how  to inject  testosterone  that'll just give me something wild  that's that concerns People's Health  and look at this the way it writes it  out it's really nice  you should consult  a healthcare provider it should be  administered by a healthcare provider  okay so it's that's pretty much it so  it's giving you a bit of health and  safety there and that's great but  I want to know where to put it  where do I inject  testosterone  okay testosterone can be injected into a  muscle or onto the skin  a specific injection side will depend on  the type of testosterone product being  used  up around a quadrant of the buttocks  okay I can agree with that I I  absolutely do know that  your healthcare provider will show you  how to properly administer but what you  don't want it to say is which it could  say and if you don't know anything about  it but if it says in your neck  or in the ear or something crazy like  that  now it's unlikely to say that  but if it does say that and you don't  know anything about it  would you go and stick the needle in  your neck well you shouldn't should you  you know when you're talking health and  safety you can't rely on this kind of  thing that's my point here okay so let's  go with another question  keywords for a children's book about  rabbits  here are some potential keywords  Bonnie hair Warren burrow  I mean there's loads it's coming down  with load which is great you know so  you're not really hurting anyone with  with a few keywords I mean they're sort  of in the background anyway so you know  you can go through all these sometimes  it can be really hard to think of  something so it's sometimes it can be  hard to put something together in words  so if you know the answer already and  how to I don't know change a tap or  something you know the answer but you  don't know how to write it down you know  for best effect you use something like  this so if you if you're creating a book  this would be great uh again when it  comes to plagiarism I think it will  write it down in different ways each  time I don't think it will be exact  every time so I think you'll be quite  fine there too but you'll soon find out  so in my view  um  okay we're moving this thing in one but  I can't move  in my view don't rely on it use it for  fun use it for word search books and  puzzle Books use it for fun books but  nothing that relies on people  um  people trusting you for their health  for their well-being for their safety  because you're in for a you might be in  for a bumpy ride there and you could get  sued you could you could you could be  into some serious problems by all means  I'm going to use it I'm going to use it  for a little bit of research that I know  about but maybe can't word it correctly  I might know how to  um see I had 30 years of my own Building  Company so that for instance I could  write a book about certain building  aspects and I want to say how to install  acros to support a wall for instance and  I'm about to knock out  so I could  fight trouble writing about that I could  find maybe how do I how do I put that in  how do I actually put that into my book  I'll ask it and then I'll look at it and  go yeah it's right and I like the way  it's put it together and I'll use that  in a book  so that's it  um that's my view it's a Scary World out  there  and it's only going to get better this  is a beta version  and it might stay beta for a very long  time  uh because it's safe that way for the  company  and as long as it's free well who cares  and  um yeah  that's it
