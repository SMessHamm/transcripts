 As we move into the future it is becoming&nbsp; increasingly clear that AI will replace a lot&nbsp;&nbsp; of jobs that we're used to these days. But one&nbsp; thing is clear, this will gradually happen over&nbsp;&nbsp; time so you still have some time to prepare for&nbsp; this change and maybe to learn some skills that&nbsp;&nbsp; will make you irreplaceable. But in order for you&nbsp; to do that you need to understand what the AI can&nbsp;&nbsp; do and that's exactly what we'll be covering in&nbsp; this video. I'll show you three examples of jobs&nbsp;&nbsp; that will easily be replaced by these advanced&nbsp; technologies that we're getting these days and&nbsp;&nbsp; it should be pointed out that for all these jobs&nbsp; it's really the entry-level positions that will&nbsp;&nbsp; be replaced first. Yes, very sad anyway. So keep&nbsp; that in mind while we move through the list. The&nbsp;&nbsp; AI that we're referring to here is open ai's&nbsp; chat GPT a state-of-the-art chatbot that has&nbsp;&nbsp; everyone confused by how good it actually is&nbsp; we're using the open Beta And if you want to&nbsp;&nbsp; try it out I made a video on how to set it up&nbsp; and how to get going really quickly. But now&nbsp;&nbsp; it's time to look at some of these examples&nbsp; of jobs that will be replaced by chat Bots&nbsp;&nbsp; just like chat GPT right here. Let's start with&nbsp; an obvious one copywriters. And as I mentioned&nbsp;&nbsp; before we're talking about entry-level copywriters&nbsp; here. Top-tier authors or people that are booked&nbsp;&nbsp; for their style or their unique vision still will&nbsp; have a place in the workforce and in our society,&nbsp;&nbsp; no doubt about it. But if you currently make your&nbsp; full-time living writing captions for social media&nbsp;&nbsp; posts or writing blog post articles. Well, it's&nbsp; probably time to start getting a little worried.&nbsp;&nbsp; But instead of me just talking about it let me&nbsp; go in here and show you why that is. So if it&nbsp;&nbsp; just opens up with write me a blog post here and&nbsp; then I pick any topic, it will do exactly that.&nbsp;&nbsp; There you go I mean have a look the voice&nbsp; is generic but it's really good. But okay&nbsp;&nbsp; maybe the AI doesn't understand the psychology so&nbsp; well and doesn't know who to Target here. Well,&nbsp;&nbsp; the thing is you can tell it if I just go in here&nbsp; and say targeting Millennials and I can do that.&nbsp;&nbsp; And it even accounted for my typo here but&nbsp; you might say hey Igor there is surely more&nbsp;&nbsp; to copywriting than just writing blog posts,&nbsp; well this thing can do most categories. If&nbsp;&nbsp; we go to Fiverr right here we can see some&nbsp; popular categories that people actually Book&nbsp;&nbsp; on a daily basis right? So, let's try sales&nbsp; copy and social media copy as an example.&nbsp;&nbsp; Foreign look at that, this is&nbsp; a very advanced writing style,&nbsp;&nbsp; and you can tell it what voice to speak in.&nbsp; I mean, come on, and even for social media,&nbsp;&nbsp; this just unlocks a ghostwriter that is available&nbsp; 24/7 and charges like a cent per caption. Look,&nbsp;&nbsp; it even did the hashtags for you, so clearly&nbsp; this is going to be very hard to compete on.&nbsp; But let's look at our next job that should&nbsp; probably be worried about these tools. Okay,&nbsp;&nbsp; and here's a truly scary one for anybody that&nbsp; acquired the skill of programming. *Everybody&nbsp;&nbsp; stay calm* As you might know, the skill set of&nbsp; this concrete chatbot goes way beyond just a&nbsp;&nbsp; simple conversation with a human being. It cannot&nbsp; just write code in multiple languages; it can also&nbsp;&nbsp; translate and debug it. And look, coding is an&nbsp; extremely wide field. Okay, so if you're a full&nbsp;&nbsp; stack developer with 20 years of experience, you&nbsp; have nothing to worry about, because there's just&nbsp;&nbsp; certain things that this thing won't be able to do&nbsp; for another 5 to 10, maybe 20 years. But if you're&nbsp;&nbsp; in an entry-level position that just kind of had&nbsp; to do all the footwork for the senior programmers,&nbsp;&nbsp; or your income is freelancing from tasks like web&nbsp; design or simple Python scripts, well this thing&nbsp;&nbsp; is going to be more responsive, and probably more&nbsp; reliable than most human beings, let's just start&nbsp;&nbsp; with an example for a simple Python script that&nbsp; automates the moving of files on your computer. Voila! It picks the right package, writes the&nbsp; whole thing for you, and the funny thing here is,&nbsp;&nbsp; if I take this code, I can even go in and say, 'I&nbsp; have this Python script that has a mistake in it;&nbsp;&nbsp; can you fix it for me?' and then all I'll do is,&nbsp; 'Sneakily remove this 'join' part of the script. And look at that, it re-inserted&nbsp; it. And what does it do if I say,&nbsp;&nbsp; "Create a simple one-page website in&nbsp; JavaScript for my car sales company? And there you go: a great starting point; and&nbsp; these are just some examples of tasks that the&nbsp;&nbsp; Senior Programmers would give away to Junior&nbsp; Programmers. Well, now they have this option,&nbsp;&nbsp; and you can do the same for different&nbsp; languages. Okay, so those are simple tasks,&nbsp;&nbsp; but what happens if I told it: okay,&nbsp; translate this Python script to Node.js? And it simply does it! Incredible. but let's look&nbsp; at our next job--customer support. *No, no, no,&nbsp;&nbsp; no, no, no, no* In a lot of cases, their job is&nbsp; looking at emails or requests and answering those,&nbsp;&nbsp; so let's have a look. Your company just received&nbsp; a customer email, and the chatbot is supposed to&nbsp;&nbsp; answer. Let's just tell it in human language that&nbsp; we received this email, and we need help from the&nbsp;&nbsp; AI. And just to have some fun here. Let's say we&nbsp; sold the computer, and the customer is furious&nbsp;&nbsp; because it doesn't work on the day after he&nbsp; purchased it. What would the AI reply here?&nbsp; I mean wow, we apologize for the inconvenience&nbsp; you're experiencing with your new computer.&nbsp;&nbsp; We understand how frustrating it can be when a&nbsp; product does not work as expected. Like, come on,&nbsp;&nbsp; this thing even has empathy built in! You want&nbsp; to resolve this matter as quickly as possible.&nbsp;&nbsp; And look at that, all from one line of input.&nbsp; If it actually knew what our company is doing,&nbsp;&nbsp; and had a database of emails associated with&nbsp; clients and their purchases, it would immediately&nbsp;&nbsp; know what computer he bought, and it could send&nbsp; it a tutorial on how to fix the issue at hand&nbsp; I mean, this is incredible. It costs&nbsp; virtually no money, it's available 24/7,&nbsp;&nbsp; and it's always forthcoming and helps in the best&nbsp; way available. So yes, all this is very scary,&nbsp;&nbsp; but it's also very powerful, and let me tell&nbsp; you that the best way to deal with it is not&nbsp;&nbsp; by ignoring it or pretending like this doesn't&nbsp; exist. The very best thing you can do is actually&nbsp;&nbsp; educate yourself on these topics and start using&nbsp; these tools to your advantage, and my mission&nbsp;&nbsp; here is to bring you content that will help you&nbsp; on that pathway. So go ahead and check out this&nbsp;&nbsp; video that shows you some everyday use cases&nbsp; for how this will be able to enhance your life&nbsp;&nbsp; today.
