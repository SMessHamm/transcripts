your attorney let's continue  from the previous conversation write me  a contract to send to the influencers  when they sign up and here is my  contract very well written looks like I  actually paid for it but no it was just  this bot if you are getting impressed by  this well let me tell you that this is  just the most basic things that you can  do here wait till you see the very last  examples but for now let's go to example  number number four write an email  template to send to customers when their  order is delayed dear value customer we  regret to inform you that your recent  order will be delayed our team is  working hard to ensure that your order  is cheap as soon as possible blah blah  blah blah blah we apologize for any  inconvenience if you have any questions  or concern contact us alright so that's  our template every time we mess up and  we delayed our achievements I will show  you how to access these two in a little  bit but first let's watch a couple more  examples to get you hyped up example  number five use it to make excuses for  you once again we're going to continue  from the previous conversation because  this template is a little Bland for my  taste and customers need always a reason  so we're gonna tell him make up an  excuse and include it in the template  dear value customer okay with regret to  inform you the reason for the delay is  that our warehouse experience a power  average earlier this week which has  disrupted our Shipping schedule  we apologize for the inconvenience this  is gold okay just for fun let me tell it  to make up another excuse make up a  different excuse  the reason for the delay is that we have  recently experienced a high volume of  orders and as a result our warehouse is  currently backlog we apologize all right  so now you have two excuses for two  times that you mess up and I'm sure that  you can keep telling him to make up  excuses for you you know it's a pretty  good liar alright so so far we have been  using this bot for mundane activities  just improving our quality of life when  it comes to you know managing and  handling an e-commerce store dealing  with customers and stuff like that but  what if we use it for marketing I  recently started a new company and I  want this bot to write me a blog post  that tells people why they should buy my  product and also I wanted to compare it  with another problem and whatever it  pulls out I'm actually gonna use it in  real life and I'm gonna put it in my  blog and to give you a little bit of  context the new company is about DTF  transfers direct to film people that  want to start their clothing brand they  can buy my transfers and they can apply  the them on hats shirts whatever  products they want and the alternative  is to go with a print-on-demand company  that they will take care of printing the  produce and shipping it to the customer  but you lose the quality control you  cannot choose any kind of products to  put it on to lose touch with your  customers because you cannot make your  own custom packaging and also it's a lot  cheaper to use my transfers and do it  yourself rather than send it to a  print-on-demand website so you get a  much better profit margin so let's see  if this bot can Encompass all of that in  one blog post make a blog post  explaining why direct to film transfers  are a better option than print on demand  when trying to start a clothing brand  also say that DTF llama can take care of  all your custom transfer needs if you're  looking to start your clothing brand you  may be wondering which type of transfer  method to use for your designs in this  blog post we'll explain why DTF  transfers are a better option than print  on demand and how DTF Lama can help you  with all your custom transfer needs  daily proceeds to tell you what they DTF  transfers are then also what print on  demand is and then it tells you several  reasons why DTF transfers are superior  to print on demand like better pin  quality more durable more versatile DTS  transfers can be applied to a wide range  of fabrics including cotton polyester  and even performance wear it almost said  everything that I wanted it to say and I  only put two sentences here but it  didn't talk about the price and also it  didn't say anything about how you get  more in touch with your customers when  you make their packages with their thank  you notes and all of that talk about the  price benefit of DTF transfers and also  that you have control over the quality  of the final product so it proceeds to  talk about the price benefit telling  them that they can get a higher profit  margin and also another Advantage is  that you have more control over how you  ship your products with print on them  are Services you have to use their  packaging and shipping methods which can  limit your branding opportunities  and now we're getting to the super fun  and mind-blowing stuff because so far it  has been just doing text for us you know  making content and you can imagine the  possibilities with this you can make  your ad copy prepare thank you notes for  your customers write mission statements  you can even ask him to make you a  script for a video for tick tock to  promote your product but this is nothing  compared to the real power that I see  with this so let's go with number seven  use it as your own personal accountant  hey bot make me a wholesale price table  with quantity breaks offer a higher  discount the more they buy with a  regular price of 24.95 for one share  right and quantity breaks are 5 10 25 50  and 100.  let's see what it pulls out  [Music]  alright so if they order five they will  get them for 22 dollars at a 10 discount  50 at 16 for a 40 discount it is a  little hard to read so put it in a table  a much easier to read now but add a  column with the total order price  [Music]  and there you go the whole table with  everything thank you both but there is  nothing compared to example number eight  use it as your own programmer alright  but I want you to write me an HTML code  that calculates the amount of time that  it will take to produce an order so that  the customer knows when to pick it up  each order can contain multiple pieces  and it takes 15 minutes to produce each  piece alright so it's making the the  layout of the website  it's adding some script in here  [Music]  and then it also explains it to you this  code creates an HTML page with a form  that allows the user to enter the number  of pieces in their order alright so how  do we check this very simple let's just  copy this code then we're gonna open  notepad and we're gonna paste this code  now we're gonna file save us and we're  gonna save it as time  calculator.html so let's test it out or  the production time calculator enter the  number of pieces in your order alright  so I'm gonna buy 20 pieces calculate  production time it will take 300 minutes  to produce your order alright not bad  right it actually brought the entire  code for me so to access these two  you're gonna go to chat dot openai.com  chat and you will be able to access the  initial research preview which is free  to use now I don't know how long this is  gonna be available for free but I will  keep the description of the video  updated now let's continue watching more  examples number 9 enhance your code so  we're gonna go back to the same chat and  we're gonna say make it look prettier  with some styling  and right now you can see how it's  applying some CSS right there you see  [Music]  and of course it explained you kind of  like what it did but we're gonna copy  this code and we're gonna test it out so  let's open notepad one more time and  we're gonna delete the previous code and  paste the new one file save it's already  saved as an HTML so now we open it and  boom  now it has some nice formatting  Calculate 90 minutes okay but look at  the text in this button is too big so  you better fix that make the text of the  button smaller  come on bot alright so let's just test  this script again and there you go now  the size of the text is a little smaller  and that leaves us with the last example  use it as Google so basically ask any  questions that you have and keep in mind  that this doesn't have access to  Internet and all the data that it has is  from before 2021 but still you can ask  him direct questions and get direct  answers for example how do I add an  announcement bar on my Shopify store  that says free shipping and this is  something that I will normally go to  Google and start researching on how to  do it or go to YouTube watch a few  videos until I find but look this guide  just gave me exact instructions on how  to do it and I noticed that when it  tells you something and it doesn't work  you tell him that it doesn't work and it  will fix it it will just show you  another way of doing it so above all I  am extremely impressed with this new  technology and I think this is gonna  revolutionize the entire world because  this is still a beta and I thought that  we were 15 years away from something  like this but no it is now imagine in  one or two years when this actually  launches how it's gonna change the way  that we do everything in this world now  let me tell you a few limitations that I  found I asked him to build me an app  that will do specific things and it  started writing the app but up to a  point it stopped and then I told him hey  the code is not complete so he said  sorry let me try it again and he started  doing it again and it stopped kind of  like at the same place a little bit  before actually so I did a little bit of  troubleshooting and it seems like they  have limited you know the length of the  responses and the kind of information  that it will give you because it's still  a beta now there are still a lot of ways  that this technology can help you run  your e-commerce business and if you  would like me to make a second part of  this video with more examples give me a  like and drop me a comment so I know  that this is something that you want to  watch thank you thank you thank you I'm  out
