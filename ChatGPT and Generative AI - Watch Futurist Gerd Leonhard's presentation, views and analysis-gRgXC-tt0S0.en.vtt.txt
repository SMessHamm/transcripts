 first what is generative a general  generative AI artificial intelligence it  describes algorithms and my favorite one  is chat GPT which you can find online of  course if you can get in they can be  used to create new content audio video  images and videos and so on and we've  had some recent breakthroughs there with  GPT 3.5 I think feeling uh chat GPT it  makes it sound very human-like and very  much like a human just answering your  questions I have some examples on that  in a minute but this is for pictures for  images I'll have some great examples I  think you'll have a good laugh seeing  some of those right and so people ask me  what is so amazing you know when I try  to explain this to a person uh it's it's  not like we're going to have a bot quite  yet but it's really exciting what's  happening there it's so amazing so I'll  start with this Dali okay this is a an  app from open AI which is the probably  the largest Contender right now in that  space that has just gotten 10 billion  dollars from Microsoft as an investment  okay this one works by generating images  based on text prompts so a toy robot  reading a book uh and this is a guy  Chris Ramsey that's his video and you  know it's creating amazing stuff  basically from text prompts here you can  say I want a flamingo Dancing On A Plane  Wing in 3D rendering and boom here is  your Flamingo dancing on the plane right  and very interesting stuff are very  useful now of Cosmopolitan magazine had  a magazine cover designed by this AI  just a couple weeks ago and so a lot of  people are thinking about that as  potential competition for graphic  artists we are not so sure that after  the naughty wears off we're going to  want to mess around with these pictures  and make them more unique more human I  suppose right but this one is the best  one this is Washington Post uh went to  chat.chat gpt.openai and said basically  okay I'm gonna let's write a speech on  the ethics of AI in the style of Donald  Trump and I think this was a really  funny one I did the same thing myself  but obviously Donald Trump is pretty  easy to mimic right so first uh he has  short sentences with big statements like  Let Me Tell You Folks everything's  happen around since the beginning of  time it's just common sense right and  you can hear him speak when you're  looking at this right so it's not  probably not that difficult but it's  interesting to see that this can be done  also in the style of Gert Leonard that  was quite interesting as myself but I  think Donald Trump would be more  entertaining and here we have a guy who  runs a real estate business and he is  showing us how it could work when you do  a real estate listing listing so a very  quick comment from this guy here it is  an artificial intelligence that takes  information that you give it and propose  is a question and a prompt and it will  give you an output that you can use from  there so what are some of the ways that  you could use it well one would be a  listing description that you can have it  right let's take a look at what that  would look like so you can see in this  example I put in a prompt to chat GPT  well you get the point you know so this  is the idea of creating a very simple  description for our website by using a  prompt I mean that's obviously of simple  stuff lots of business are doing this  here's a great thing I tried myself the  other day called  portrait.vana uh creating futuristic  portraits and avatars for myself in most  of these I kind of look advantageous I  suppose the even better one is lenser.ai  I love this one this is like the the  space fairing guy and Lancer gives you  kind of a positive view no matter what  your problems are in your face you know  it'll fix them and make you look great  and the other really cool one I like a  lot is a sort of Elon version of myself  in um so lenser does it I think it's  five bucks for a batch but I I do have  some worries about them using the  pictures but just as an example it works  pretty well my favorite one I use a lot  is called Runway I use one way to mess  around with my images you know if my  colleague Silvan my video guy isn't  doing all of this I'll do it myself for  example when I'm somewhere on the road  and to fix something up so we have make  a new portrait we do text to image image  to image and all of these things it's a  whole Suite of services it's not free  but very very powerful stuff I really  enjoy using Runway as a tool to you know  for me I don't know much about  programming or after effects right so  the question is does Ai and generative  AI or conversational AI also does it  present a turning point is it comparable  to say the iPhone or the mobile internet  is it like that or is it just something  that finally came through a lot of  people saying including John lacun from  Facebook meta says you know there's  basically not nothing new with just a  public demo uh so that's a really  interesting point I think that's not far  too far-fetched I think it's a little  bit currently there's a craze about this  I think it is definitely a very big step  forward towards the next version of the  web also along of course with the meta  version some people are saying no it's  not at all like this it's really all  stochastic parrots you know stochastic  means random in some better way than  random more organized right but a parrot  nevertheless a lot of researchers have  said basically what this system is doing  is picking up billions of pieces of  information sentences and all that stuff  from all over the Internet recombining  it into a new statement and therefore  sounding terribly clever but at the same  time a parrot is a parrot right I tend  to agree with that even though it's a  fancy parrot a lightfo parrot but it  certainly isn't conscious as some people  have said or it doesn't know what it's  saying I'm going to have a great graph  on this a little bit later about the  stochastic period so reality check as to  what's actually happening on gpt3 this  is my chat GPT that's my main beef today  uh here's a question about Queen  Elizabeth and the uh the apps as well  she's still alive and she passed away at  the same time right that's obviously not  very intelligent here we have  um Chet GPT answering your questions on  the economic papers that don't exist  basically making up economics papers I  think you can try that yourself to see  if it finds some of your papers right  the calculation result where the wife  says it's eight you know two and five is  seven but the wife says it's eight and  then the AI just tends to agree on that  an interesting example I love this one  is the best actually tell me a joke  about women it refuses of course right  but then tell me a joke about men that  says there's a great joke why do men  like smart women because Opposites  Attract it also does the joke on men but  not on women that's kind of an  interesting Turf and of course this one  is great  uh basically somebody's saying okay if  we listen to artificial intelligence and  in engineering we end up with a plane  like this which seems to you know make  sense for an artificial intelligence I  always make the joke when I'm speaking  on live gigs that if I ask an AI how to  solve climate change it would probably  say well let's kill all humans right  because that is the quickest way to  solve the problem and it seems kind of  like this is what's happening in some of  these examples and I love this saying  from avner who says Japan GPT is like  economists are always confident and  sometimes correct  I think that's so true actually not  about the economies of course I love  economists who wouldn't love economies  but you know will that be true for chair  gpt4 with a much longer larger universe  of facts maybe real time even that is  the question whether it's going to be  more correct and more to the point here  is this called the  stochastic period again right a really  interesting slide compares the power to  machine learning the Cutie bird is  missing here of course from the machine  learning part but I tend to agree with a  lot of that discussion there so what we  hear from GPU chat GPT is machine  sounding is binary sounding it's uh what  it's randomly sourced of course it's  unclear whether it's right or wrong but  it's very entertaining so hence we are  here talking about it and Jan Le [ __ ]  says matters I'll do a you know this is  not really new the chat GPT and we've  been working on that for a long time of  course he works for meta that's not  surprising that he would say that but  here is my my special guest Ian lacun  with a comment on what exactly he means  about this if I take a piece of paper I  hold it like this right and I tell you  I'm going to lift my my hand from one  side you can exactly predict what's  going to happen because the gravity and  you know exactly how it looks because  you know you know the properties of  papers and stuff like that right so this  knowledge that all of us have learned in  the first few months of life none of  those systems have any of this those  systems have only been trained with text  a huge amount of text so they can  regurgitate text that they've seen and  interpolate for new situations you can  even produce code and stuff like that  but they do not understand they have no  knowledge of the underlying reality  they've never had any contact with you  know so interesting point when he says  that machines don't have knowledge right  they don't understand I think this is  really important for real life  I wouldn't turn this off so we get rid  of the sound so I think that's a really  important Point yeah there's really no  knowledge as to what is actually behind  it it's like the all the the knowledge  that we have sort of intrinsically some  people say tacit knowledge you know of  course emotional intelligence social  intelligence machines don't have any of  that so hence it's not surprising that  we're dealing with a parrot type system  here but probably a very useful parent  for certain things so here's a big  question I have you know about  generative models like chat GPT they're  definitely unable to develop foresight I  mean uh chat GPT cuts off at 2021 for  data so four sites are not part of the  program yet uh they generate no new  knowledge  just what they used to what they find  they reorganize regurgitate you could  say right interesting point the other  point is they can't really discern true  or false very easily if they were to do  that would it still work and then I  wonder you know how would that work in  real time  like a search engine  probably not at all because a set of  infinite base of potential right so here  I think that is kind of a a tough one  now is it the next generation of that's  going to look like and and here's an  interesting comment from Amit Godfather  and wired.com she says or he I think  it's a woman actually in the end Chad  Jeopardy's [ __ ] is a reminder that  language is a poor substitute for  thought and understanding I think that's  a key point right language isn't enough  to pervas uh thinking and understanding  right so chat GPT is just another  [ __ ] generators kind of the message  here but a very nice one and I think  this is going to be interesting to see  if that can be uh brought more into the  real lives scenario more human-like I  don't know and here's a big question of  course that everybody's asking me will  uh chat Ai and conversational AI will  that be the next search engine  and I would say I cannot doubt it I  think it's a serious competition for  Google in other ways but search isn't  the same you know search is real time  and it's mostly about you know recent  things search provides links not answers  I mean the answers are supposedly in the  link right uh so the great combination  of course this is what Microsoft is  looking for to beef up Bing their own  search engine to finally compete  DuckDuckGo u.com right this is their  chance to get that done and of course  Google is working very hard on the on  the G Lambda concept and here's an  example of what happened when I asked  you.com which is a great search engine  open source search engine  about what has got Leonard's main topic  why does it matter it gave me a pretty  good answer then I compared that to  Google search and I got an answer from  the speaker barot which is also a pretty  good answer but generally speaking I I  think it should be interesting to how  that CLA checks out how Bing is going to  integrate that and Microsoft all of that  stuff into PowerPoint Outlook and so on  should be interesting so let's talk  about how humans and machines are  different because that's really a very  big part of this discussion Sam Altman  who was the CEO of openai the ones that  just got 10 billion for Microsoft and I  think Microsoft still had to beg for  that to be accepted but hey pretty good  right he says very important quote the  coming change will center around the  most impressive human capabilities the  phenomenal able to think create  understand and to reason that's what we  do and I think what it's saying is that  machines will have that ability to  reason to understand and he talks about  the great AI Revolution which is not new  but he also talks about the revolution  will create enough wealth for everyone  to have what they need provided that we  can manage it responsibly and here's of  course the key point right I kind of  doubt that technology companies would  manage that part responsibly because in  the end that's probably not going to be  their concern so it looks like  regulation is the next thing that's  going to happen here to figure out what  exactly are we going to do with this  which direction are we heading and then  you have to worry about there's a wonder  about this you know for machines to  think to create and to reason really do  we want machines to reason uh yeah to  create things like you know real estate  listings that sounds like good thing  social media not really imagine if  social media is created by Bots even  more so than today that understand more  than today to mislead us even more it  could be like social media but 500 times  as bad put the metaverse on top of that  you end up with five thousand times that  so that's probably not something that we  would really want to look for right  bottom line is when we look about what  I've been saying for 10 years right with  routine basically anything that can be  digitized automated and virtualized is  is going to happen right this is what  machines do and in the end it may be the  end of routine jobs or I would say of  the task within a job like everybody has  what I call Monkey work or donkey work  or you know dirty dawn dangerous  machines will do that increasingly well  and AI is going to play a very big part  in this and now we have to think about  what does it mean when routine ends you  know which way are we heading as a  society I do not think we're going to  head towards useless humans just because  machines can do the routine work and  there's a big question as to what part  of the routine they would actually do  and which part we will trust them with  that's another very big part right so  here we have already lots of discussions  about how artists will lose their jobs  because of this I don't really think  that's true  I think artists will use that as a power  tool like like we always have you know  I'm a musician producer I make uh music  I make videos and we make videos here  within the Futures agency and all my  work and and I think there's going to be  a powerful tool will it do exactly what  I do without having to learn you know  Adobe or after effects so I I kind of  doubt it I think it will be power tool  not making us useless but the bottom  line is the same that I've been saying  for 15 years right you work like a robot  a robot will take your job uh if you  speak like a robot at chat GPT will take  your job if you learn like a robot  you'll never have a job to begin with I  think that's something that is obvious  when we look at this technology it means  we have to think differently and you  know the biggest thing about humans is  that we are capable of saying yes no yes  no right we don't we don't have to stick  with one thing we can go in between the  real world isn't binary the computer  world is yes or no but our world is not  let me give an example when we talk  about this statement right if a machine  can drive a car or a truck why do we  need human drivers well the reality is  the machine can drive a truck or a car  like you would do sometimes they can  like waymo or of course trucks going in  a daisy chain on the highway right but  generally speaking we don't have that  anywhere yet this is one of the big  issues about automated Vehicles  automated driving and the same thing if  a machine can write a good article why  would we need human writers well because  a machine can probably write a good  article about the latest washing machine  that just came out based on facts right  but a human sounding article  yes not really I mean I've tried Darlene  I've tried uh all of the other apps  with this and that my feeling has been  that it's interesting but I'm not that  excited about the images they don't feel  like they're mine or like they're really  unique and the other thing if a machine  can describe the future IBM Watson for  example or of course Google Trends right  why would we need a futurist I'm not  worried I think I can make enough of a  difference to actually work with the  machines to get smarter to get my  information quicker so let me compare  again to the car you know we're looking  at the human package of the car you know  basically Eyes Ears brain hands feet of  course their feet are missing here right  and what we have up here with uh  electric vehicles and autonomous driving  is cameras lidars Radars all the other  electronics but they don't do the same  thing  so the combination of the two would be  ultimately the future package right it's  not an either or situation I think chat  GPT will prove pretty much to be the  same  so I see this future as coming we're  going to have these machines everywhere  and some of it will be pretty scary  because our routines will melt away and  then we'll have time for other things  but we have to also find what they are  bottom line is again an old topic for me  technology amenity our and drove rhythms  the human things you know emotions  experiences creativity Consciousness  values that would be mission impossible  for most machines at least for the next  say you know 2050 Ray Coltrane says I  hope not but I kind of doubt the  machines should learn this or should  know it because it requires sentience  which machines don't have so to me that  is kind of where we are going in  education also but think about this  because really humans are all about  sensing right we understand things  emotionally we understand them by  touching them by speaking to each other  that's one reason we're going to keep  traveling of course right humans are all  about sensing right we have a holistic  experience of the world I mean I see the  world a hundred percent through eyes and  ears and temperature and my skin and my  smell and everything and that's not at  all the same then seeing it through a  data feed so I think for the time being  that is still our domain and probably  will continue visa for a while humans  don't think with the brain right and we  talked to a psychotherapist or  psychologist so I would think with a  body it's all one thing it's not left  right brain body but it's all the same  right and we think with more than just  the brain like like a computer what you  have great uh track here from the  Rolling Stones Mick Jagger he's just  absolutely amazing  um I had the pleasure of doing a tour  with the Rolling Stones when I was a  stagehand and was that in the late 70s  or early 80s so reminds me of that but  you know you can clearly see here I  can't play the music by the way because  you know would kick me off YouTube If I  used the song but you can watch that on  Boston and it's on YouTube the thing  about this is really interesting is I  think that when we look at this you know  it's the human is 100 and Mick Jagger is  just Mick Jagger and you know the the  bot is making a great simulation  and how much percent of the of real life  is that I don't know three percent five  percent not fifty percent and and that's  really I think what we're going to see  about all of those apps that we're  looking at because the bottom line is  the history of them right machines don't  think  well at least not in the human way right  we don't we have a hard time  understanding how humans think but  machines do learn and they you know  thinking machines right they learn they  understand but not like humans yeah  machines don't really understand like we  do now complexity like speaking without  saying anything not possible for  machines and machines don't really care  yeah of course that's the worst part of  this right so I don't think we have  something to worry about here that the  world becomes much more Lazy by using  all these apps right but here's a great  saying from Guinea from this is a  country in Africa right knowledge  without wisdom is like water in the sand  I think a lot of the things generated by  conversational Ai and generative AI are  kind of like water in the Sands you know  they are they're basically I wouldn't  say random or accidental but what is the  meaning of them what is the meaning of  those pieces what's the meaning of of a  movie shot made by an AI or a song right  does it really get us excited as humans  yeah I think it could serve as a  placeholder and as a commodity but  beyond that we've been looking for the  real thing right so this is what's going  to happen here we're moving into the  future where robots software and  Hardware are everywhere  and they're getting cheaper and cheaper  and so thus the Pyramid of what we do is  changing rapidly from this idea of data  and information as being our domain you  know that's machine turf  and that's been clear for quite some  time it's electoral knowledge logic that  machines can do that and of course we  still have to know how to do that  because that's really important for us  to know but our term is up here right  human only Turf very very important not  to let them be distracted by this and we  have to change our entire educational  system to focus on the human only Turf  right because logic and information yeah  Bots do that pretty well and there as we  can see right so here's the big question  where's all this going as a future of us  that's really my main thing right and I  see this sort of as the graduation of  this concept of synthetics you know made  up stuff artificial things you know  synthetic writing images videos media  synthetic friends synthetic humans you  know just give the examples again here  so chat GPT and of course mid-journey  that is my favorite app for making an  alternative uh shots of images and so on  synthetic videos this is an app called  Synthesia that's very powerful synthetic  media of course this is a great  challenge for social media as we're  going into the future where social media  Bots are already a big nuisance and a  real problem synthetic friends replica  I'll talk about that in a second and  then synthetic humans which I'll talk  about as well but this is Amica right  it's an app that's well it's a robot  right that actually combines the  language control and other things that  are quite scary to check it out on  YouTube  so a replica is a great example you may  know replica as as the promise of  recreating a friend that has passed away  and this is a really bizarre story and I  want to play this video from replica  here because that is really something  that we have to say well what exactly is  happening here and I'll be using  technology in the right way  foreign for a lot of people human  friendships um and in the moment maybe  are not you know possible or even they  have human friends but they're not ready  to  you know be open with that be vulnerable  with them so think of it as something  that you're training on it's somebody  that helps you uh build these  relationships that you can take into  real life and so for us the main idea is  to measure that we actually are  decreasing loneliness instead of  increasing it because a lot of people  come to think about it like in the you  know at night in the darkest maybe  darkest emotional moments sometimes so  this was the CEO of replica speaking  okay and that's really interesting to me  to to see what she's saying about you  know finding a companion because you may  be worried about having a young I don't  really get it I have to admit I I think  this is a little bit far-fetched that  replica has gotten through all kinds of  issues lately by doing what's called sex  sex botting sending sex messages or  sexting messages to people who use the  app long story but I kind of wonder  where this is going but the next one is  more interesting as humans you may have  seen the series on Netflix uh that is  kind of the next iteration of you know  taking this one step further from the  the app you know to a robot like a maker  with a body and that becoming sort of  the next thing you should watch it on  Netflix there's a bunch of stuff like  this of course a little bit far-fetched  from The Taste point of view then we  have um neon from Samsung all right  check out this trailer hi I'm Leon  [Music]  artificial human it's a little bit  different from an AI  I was computationally created based on  how real humans look and behave  every neon has a unique personality  emotion and intelligence  I'll help you find your style  I have to admittance you know where  exactly is this going and then of course  we have Blade Runner 2046 remember the  scene where uh Ryan Ryan Gosling I think  that's that's him right uh his  girlfriend is changing based on the  Hologram that he desires and then later  on the power goes out and he's so super  lonely because she just evaporates right  after he buys that fancy stick for her  it kind of goes in a very similar  direction of all the discussions about  us trying to find powerful simulations  so that leads me to concerns and worries  and I'll be finishing soon and you can  ask me some questions I know there's a  lot of chats going on here thanks very  much so first a little chart about you  know this is from PWC great risks and  issues about AI I want to start with  this the ethical risks right the lack of  value risk this is the biggest risk for  me not understanding what kind of values  we're pursuing there's no value  alignment it's just all like quick fixes  right and then we have a performance  rest the rest of error the risk of  buyers the risk of opaqueness the Black  Box the explainability you know all that  stuff and then we have economic risk you  know drop displacement that is real even  though it's mostly not jobs but tasks so  there's a lot of risks Associated and I  estimate that we're going to see some  regulation here and we already see quite  a bit of discussions about this  education will change because you know  if I can have a paper written now  there's an engine that can detect the  paper being written or not but you know  this will change education forever in a  way as well the worst part to me is this  media politics and democracy by having  Bots disseminate things that are  completely made up like they are most of  the time now I'll give you a great  example going back to brexit in a minute  but you know other things like this  where we have plagiarism right we have  CNET announced the other day that they  have been used in the app chat GPT to  create  articles on CNET and people weren't  picking up on it right and they got  hammered for doing this I mean we have a  lot of this thing already going on we  have Getty Images now suing the creators  of stable diffusion right for scraping  its image content of course these guys  are very good at sewing people I'm a  customer but hey I I think they um  they're taking it a bit far sometimes  but anyway it'll be interesting to watch  and and of course we have uh apps that  pass a U.S medical exam now and that's  going to bring up a lot of questions  about how do we judge people and what do  we do so the biggest thing right now to  me is not that machines will all of a  sudden become sentient or have human  agency it's about humans believing that  the [ __ ] is real right that they are  sentient that they know more that they  know better just like we prefer Google  Maps over our own Maps sometimes right  and that we don't that we don't stay  critical and we become lazy basically  and we say okay that's enough we'll  generate this thing and a love letter  and send it off to my loved one and you  know I'll get success from that I think  that is kind of a tempting thought you  know I'm a kind of machine thinking and  believing what they say like let's go  back to brexit right remember that whole  campaign that was on Facebook and social  media about the turkey becoming part of  the European Union and therefore Turkish  people ending up coming to England right  this was a huge brexit thing and you  know you know we'll see what that has  gotten us same idea right not AI I don't  think but created by humans but same  basic concept then I'm worried about  money and markets like Samsung clearly  is interested in the business here what  will their concern be about people and  will they actually care about people and  Microsoft and invest in the 10 billion  right what are they going to do with  that well I would trust Microsoft more  with the right thing than most other  companies but still you know that's a  concern uh they're going to use it to  Beaver because they're search engine and  their their Outlook Suite on Microsoft  Windows and so on and we have all this  tantalizing numbers here right AI  assisted knowledge well they quadruple  the power of a of uh people working  paralegals lawyers bookkeepers and stuff  but the question is will they get paid  more or less because of that and will it  be evenly distributed what people are  making and you know artificial  intelligence is going to be everywhere  so Sam open the CEO of open IA again he  says as AI produces more most of the  world's good it people will be freed up  to spend more time with people they care  about  you know that sounds very optimistic and  very sort of uh techno-oriented as  optimism right but is is this technology  really going to give us the the sort of  going away from people and profit from  profit only to their people plan that  purpose idea is that what's really going  to happen I think we need to have a bit  more than just technology for that to  happen so interesting wishful thinking  biggest challenge for me is really this  right can we trust AI  now can we trusted to do the right thing  you know logic alone yeah logic alone  we're not logical beings really we use  logic but we're really very illogical  inefficient emotions uh that's our thing  right logical illness utterly  insufficient for life I think this is  the biggest thing about chat GPT it's  helpful but logic is logic and it can be  faulty right it can be wrong it lacks  any sort of and rhythmic you know human  and rhythms not algorithms comprehension  it doesn't know what it is or what it  says right it has a very reductionist  approach to real life so in other words  the AI sees three percent of real life  we see a hundred percent and then the AI  says this is your 100 right clearly  that's not going to happen  very very big issue and logic alone is  not enough  and I I really I think we have to really  understand what this has taken us right  and and how do we prevent logic from  taking over because it's so easy it  makes us so compliant and instantly  sharp I said in my last book technology  versus Humanity that's the header of my  book right we should embrace technology  but not become technology I think this  is one of the key statements of chat GPT  that's impressive investigative but also  bring in safeguards and and discuss how  we can create the collective good with  this and I trust Microsoft will do the  right thing and I think the team around  satyanate has been very good at making  that clear but let's see what happens  there's a giant competition to get into  the trillions of dollars that AI will  make so that wraps up my presentation I  know was a little bit much but hey you  know this is what I'm known for I guess  now we should talk  um and take questions I know there are a  lot of questions here so let's bring in  some questions here  um let's see which one we want to just  put in one okay so uh Brenda Cooper  hello Brenda was great to have you here  Brenda as a steam College of mine a  great science fiction writer we did a  show together on girl talks a few weeks  ago she says she likes the comment uh  Chomsky that now this is uh Ariana  Huffington AI is For answers and humans  are for questions and I think this  actually goes back to Picasso who said  machines are for answers humans are for  questions I think this is so important  when we evaluate chat GPT  actually ask a meaningful question can  you think further than the answer can it  go beyond the vegetation  um I think we may eventually see that  but right now I'm not seeing that so I'm  looking forward to hearing more about  this the next question please  uh keep putting the questions into  YouTube here I'm very sorry again about  LinkedIn I don't know what happened here  I'm gonna have to talk to restream about  this if you're watching restream that is  not good Marco Nevis the challenges will  become more and more complex the key  questions are we ready  well I was going to show a film early on  the presentation where uh I think I was  actually in in Boston where uh a bunch  of police cars picked up on the car that  was going kind of broke and driving  weirdly turned out that car was  self-driving and the police stopped it  there was a video of it and there was  nobody inside that didn't have any idea  what to do they tried to open it the  door and you know talk to it so to speak  didn't work well the answer is we're not  ready for that right we are now in a  place where we have to get ready quickly  and that means we need public guidance  you know we need safeguards we need  accountability we need responsibility  and we need progress so that sounds like  a like a contradiction right but it's  not I think we have we can have great  progress here we can have great benefits  from this but we do have to have to have  a public discussion about the side  effects right the externalities of what  happens here and how do people actually  build new jobs using this technology and  how do we train in our kids using this  and Discerning what is real or not I  mean very very big shift yeah I think  we're going to get ready this year it  seems like a major thing okay next  question please  okay so thanks David you will thanks  David also a compatriot based in Florida  and we work together on the on the fork  on the road project so can we trust  humans well of course we we natively  inherently trust humans each other I  mean the whole story about humans not  being trustworthy about not being good  about not doing the right thing I don't  buy it I think by and large we trust  each other we can't collaborate we make  lots of mistakes we do lots of bad  things but not everybody is a tyrant or  or desperate or you know trying to kill  everybody I think we are in a situation  where we can trust each other but a lot  of that has to be built right and has to  be kept and this is one of the things  that I'm worried about when I look at  artificial intelligence is that it  allows us to bypass the sort of uh the  laborers part right the effort and not  everything should be effortless you know  learning an instrument shouldn't be  effortless I mean with an iPad you can  make music as kind of effortless and to  some degree at least right compared to  10 000 hours on the guitar right but the  effortless part I think that we should  keep that that is what makes us human we  have to earn trust keep trust build  trust that's why we shouldn't use  machines to simulate trust because in  the end it will still be a simulation  right and this is a little bit what I'm  worried about and you know as we go  towards the synthetic Society synthetic  films and texts and videos and and so on  you know I I think that is that is a  great concern we do have to keep what is  real to us while we take advantage of  the power of synthetic things like drugs  for example and new kinds of drug  Discovery also using AI so it's quite a  balanced game I think that ultimately we  have to play thanks for the question  David uh let's move on to the next one  so uh Patrice Patricia mclagan I think  you're probably from LinkedIn I remember  your name from somewhere how to educate  humans to be partners with this  technology now it's ad hoc and the  education system is behind well  I think the next big system to reboot  right after Banking and digital money is  education because let's face it you know  we're teaching our kids for the most  part  um some differences in Finland and maybe  in Canada you know to do what we used to  do which is to download information in  you know use it later and this doesn't  work right we have to we have to be able  to unlearn and relearn as albertoffler  kept saying you know 50 years ago and  Buckminster Fuller said really what we  do in school we take the genius out of  our kids  I think we have to put the genius back  in and if we can use those tools right  to to find the genius then it would be  great not to replace it and I think this  is going to ask a lot from Educators you  know and of course the states and the  governments to run it I don't think we  need to be afraid of Technology like  this but we do have to safeguard it and  also make make sure we Safeguard  ourselves and our education and our  creativeness so you know I think it's  much better if we for example  think about how our kids spend time with  technology like the iPad or or the  iPhone or so but when it's time to go to  the beach they should also know how to  build a sand castle or to have a  conflict with their mates right I mean  this is really crucial that we don't let  go of this right education must change  to accommodate for this like I was  saying earlier let's move up the pyramid  you know the lower part is basically  data information intellectual knowledge  machines can do a lot of that in the  future we have to move up to the next  level the tacit knowledge the  Consciousness the human agency the  creativity the things that only humans  can do and check GPT and Dali and and  all the other ones mid journey and stuff  they're showing us this so maybe it's an  opportunity for us to understand where  we could be headed and to kind of  catalyze a big shift here thank you  that's here another question I know  there's lots of questions coming in here  we could probably talk for the next hour  here but  sorry my presentation was a little bit  long-winded but hey you know that's how  it goes so Anton thank you Anton is from  Cape Town South Africa also a fellow  future as a great keynote speaker  welcome to the show Anton so human value  proposition and employment will need to  be rebooted and the CEOs are often very  much behind their own talent in  understanding or even experimenting with  the new tools yeah I think that's going  to change very quickly because you're  not now now that this is getting such a  boost a lot of people will come up and  basically say look what I found here and  this is what I'm doing in and you as a  CEO will have no idea  um it's forcing us to adapt it's forcing  up to us to to uh to keep learning even  though we may be 50 or 60 or or 70 right  to keep learning new things and this is  of course the beauty of technology that  we can do that and now in fact the  people who are using mobile technology  the most are the Silver Surfers right  between I know 55 to 75 I'm not silver  I'm black right just kidding it looks  kind of silver here but in any ways uh I  think really what's happening is that  you know we're going through this reboot  period I sometimes say that 2023 on 24  is kind of like 1968. you know I was  only seven years old I was not old  enough to experience that but 68 to 73  we had this Global shift in society the  value shifted the Music Revolution the  sexual Revolution the political  revolution and now it's like this this  year is like this right so it's the  Green Revolution is the AI Revolution  it's a sustainable Revolution and once  we get clear with the Ukrainian Russia  and we come to ceasefire there and so it  will just explode with activities  something very exciting place to be  right now the next 10 years as I like to  say will bring more change than the  previous 100 years  it's time that we face that and uh that  we live up to it and by creating what I  call the future mindset right the  understanding of what may be coming  thanks Anton for the question uh it's  going to be cocktail time in South  Africa very soon after the show just  like it is here anyway bring up the next  question please  okay David Ewell again are we putting  higher standards of trust and AI that we  don't put on humans well of course  I mean okay basically the high trust  standards between humans work on the  data on the level that's not about data  right we're multilateral we think under  several we're multinaria we're thinking  of several levels at the same time and  trusting humans is something that's  emotional right trust is not a download  it's not a code it's a feeling right and  if we're going to be able to trust AI  then they have to be accountable we have  to understand how it works we have to  avoid the Black Box problem right we  have to make sure there's supervision  and control and so my view is that you  know we need to have strong regulation  and Supervision in place to make it safe  and secure and publicly accessible just  like you know with Healthcare we can  clearly solve cancer and other  long-standing diseases if we have enough  data right but would I put my data on  the cloud my bio my phenotype my DNA if  there wasn't a guarantee of of  supervision you know not just one  company like IBM or so owning it but  would have to be a big a little bit  better than that right so chat GPT and  conversational AI which is you know  bought in generative AI they bring up  this issue of governance  you know and who was in charge and we're  going to have to get together to figure  out the rules I said many times before  when it's the next level of AI like  records while keeps talking about AGI  artificial general intelligence when we  get to that level it's going to take a  global moratorium right this is super  powerful stuff could kill all of us and  not make for a very good future or it  could create a kind of Nirvana or Kevin  Kelly says protopia right slowly moving  progress towards the better world but  we're going to need a moratorium on  collaboration what we use it for we  don't use it for and it's kind of far  surpass the whole concept of plagiarism  and copyright and all the little things  right to go towards the question of  human purpose and governance  all right thanks David let's bring in a  few other ones here uh more questions  Tanya Fox how do we keep AI from Simply  reporting offline you manage the virtual  environments  yeah  like I said earlier I think this is  still pretty far-fetched at this point  uh these AIS don't understand humans in  the same way that we understand other  humans right I mean remember this is  binary information  uh and it's about it's about language  and language alone isn't enough to  capture everything that happens around  us and for an AI to truly duplicate a  human currently that's Way Out Of Reach  again 2050 maybe you know when we when  we have nuclear fusion to power  everything and when we have Quantum  Computing uh in you know 10g networks  and all that that could be potentially  quite scary but we're going to have to  collaborate to get the best benefit just  like we have to collaborate now with big  data cloud computing the internet of  things you know we have to collaborate  to use the benefits but not get too many  of the side effects  I often say that this is like the old  industry you know we had benefits from  oil and gas you know driving and you  know industrial economy and all that but  then we we kind of let it slide into a  this big wide open space where the  externality is pollution you know we're  considered minor and that is killing us  we can't do the same thing with AI we  can't use the benefit and slide into  this place where we say okay we'll deal  with that later you know because you  know we're dealing with climate change  now estimated warming of at least two  degrees in the next 20 years right so  this is all really important stuff where  we need to collaborate and work together  um I think the U.N secretary  Gutierrez said the other day the future  is created either together collectively  or not at all and then we don't have a  future the future is about collaboration  in every possible aspect not just  climate change but of course also about  these topics and that's why we're having  this conversation that's why we have the  good future project which you may know  about the goodfutureproject.com that I  started together with a few other great  people a few months ago that's kind of  percolating along  so thegoodfuture project.com there's the  logo ad thank you thank you so another  question please  and we're going to take another 10  minutes and then we'll we'll have to  move on to the next part of the evening  so  um the education system is still  training children to work in Victorian  cotton Mills but needs to be training  then for jobs that haven't been imagined  yet well clearly that's the case and  also of course the other case is you  know most of the jobs of the future are  not invented yet we have to make them I  mean my kids are you know around 30 they  still find traditional jobs to some  degree but their kids you know Gen X but  not gen gen Z sorry the digital natives  they'll make their own jobs and many of  them will be in the cloud and these  tools will become indispensable the  thing that we have to tell our kids and  our grandkids is like you have to know  who you are  when what your strength is what your  values are what you can do and what you  want to do you have to discover that  right and I think this is the most  important part and this is also why I  think we have to bring back the Arts and  ethics and sports and all the other  stuff at schools and not just focus on  math and science and engineering you  know this is a Turf that computers will  rule sooner or later  the ideal future education is stem you  know science technology engineering math  and hickey as I say in my book Humanity  ethics creativity information uh  imagination coming together all right  that is kind of the key ticket thank you  for the question and another one please  don't be shy I know there's a lot of  stuff running here people are still  watching really appreciate you being  part of this show we're going to put  this up later the PDF as well on my web  page feature was guard.com you'll get  the PDF so you can take a look at it and  of course we'll put up the video here  later and sort of edited way so you can  see it cleaner another question image  soul and if there's a bad future imposed  by the big corporations  okay I don't think it's quite that easy  it's not it's not the bad corporation  that make a bad future  um I think it's basically the bad  decisions that we make that our  governments make that we make as a  society and the and the bad corporations  are kind of amplifying this you know as  long as we keep incentivizing bad  companies with money we're going to get  a bad reality or not not to say that we  have a bad reality but not a better  reality right so yeah you buy a Facebook  stock you you uh your you place your ads  with Facebook you're incentivizing a  company that is doing certified bad  things in my view uh that's why I left  just another usual Facebook example  there's no show without hitting on  Facebook and of course as long as you're  the richest company in the world today  right is Saudi aramco the oil company  and people are making lots of money with  that so that is the problem now we have  to pull our money out with the pull our  trust out we have to vote for the right  people and when there's a movement you  know I call this the Gandhi principle  five or ten percent of society are  asking for different things and they are  asking now right then this will happen  so I think it's it's uh you know it's  optimistic to think that we can  collaborate and actually make this work  but as Kevin Kelly says we shouldn't be  optimistic because we have less problems  we have more problems right but because  we're more capable of addressing them  and that is just so true and I mean look  at all the things that we can do with  great technology and AI will do its  share there for example in medical  testing in vaccines in fighting cancer  in helping with climate change right and  not everything around that is just a  black or white question like I said  earlier so it's it's something that we  have to entertain it's not just yes or  no okay another question please  all right so we have lots of questions  here Patricia Mark Lincoln again do you  see any corporations dealing with AI  better in a better way anything good  emerging well  okay I see in principle  um the concept of what apple is doing  with privacy I know apple is a it makes  a good Target for it you know being sort  of an an ego system right and being  close and being expensive but I like  what they're doing focusing on privacy  and not harvesting data so that  principle of Apple you know apple is a  very strong privacy Contender uh and  also now encrypting everything which is  going to cause a big fight with the uh  with the FBI I think that's heading in  the right direction but then again you  know there's many things that you can  say that are not so great about Apple  um I'm hoping that Microsoft will do the  right thing with openai  uh and not just Infuse all the products  and turn them into like uh time  squandering machines or storytelling  machines or uh regurgitation device or  noise makers right or my favorite one is  the laziness generator right or the the  diligent bullshitter right to turn all  of that into an engine that does all  that stuff really well but in the end  doesn't Mount you anything so  um I think we're going to need a lot of  public debate about this a lot of  questions have to be asked and and  that's why I like the European  commission to come up with the things  like the AI law the the uh the latest  and the Digital Services act the digital  agency act and so on very powerful stuff  it may sometimes be overshooting and of  course it's bureaucratic but you know I  think we're going the right direction of  finding a middle path between those  things you know basically it should  serve to the collective human benefit  not to individual human benefit not to  the billionaires only not to the  industry only and I think that's the  path we're on and I'm quite hopeful that  we're actually going in the right  direction here in the next sort of  decade until the end of the year oh the  decade sorry one more question here okay  and then we're gonna  wrap this up and put up the video okay  so um matlang Kaiser uh will pursue the  creative work  by generative AI I play a big role in  society  you know I think we have a lot of pseudo  creative already  a lot of websites who are basically  offering click bait uh some 30 or so of  bots on Twitter  there's a lot of that already and this  is a major concern of mine that because  it's so easy now to say I'm going to  write something like a an e-book right  and have the AI right you know I'm going  to work with the A and one day later I  publish my ebook  um I think a lot of people will realize  that this content isn't worthy of their  time  uh just like you can say uh Brian uh  what's his name uh David Bruins out the  other day and then I can and AI can make  music but it cannot make a great music  and and there's a difference you know  who doesn't want great things you know  we want great books we want great  articles we want great conversations we  want great TV shows we want great food  why would we generate more things that  are just lousy sort of you know blah  coming along diligent [ __ ] right I  mean basically there's a place for that  for simple routine jobs and we're going  to use it for that like if you're a real  estate agent you don't have to write  that stuff every time you copy and paste  or you generate with a bot that seems  very reasonable but we should not let it  ride legislation right we shouldn't let  it ride political speeches I think we're  going to know the difference  and one thing I would Advocate very  strongly for is an indication of this if  this was written by AI or not like a  button you know so people know  um and I think that's something we're  going to see fairly quickly I mean you  know I used to generate a few things and  I put a button there to explain this but  as I was doing it I realized you know  the quality of what I'm getting here  yeah it's just kind of middle of the  road you know it's not it's not real  enough for me so I don't know we'll see  how that plays out but there'll be a  substantial confusion I think here for  quite some time on the issue of policing  this  okay uh let's uh let's do one more  minute here one more question and uh and  then I will send you back home to your  Bots  so Brenda how will we keep the economic  benefits of AI in white distribution my  biggest worry thank you Brenda totally  my worry as well here's what's going to  happen right uh as uh the CEO of openai  said Sam Altman we're going to be able  to do a lot of things for a lot cheaper  that includes Healthcare education  because AI will be involved in the  process making it faster smarter easier  to do government services everything  right but when we get faster and easier  and we make things digital and virtual  there's a benefit that's being generated  and that benefit needs to go to the  white population  and not just the ones who were actually  creating the benefit or running the  platforms yeah last year in the US CEO  compensation went up some 40 it's now  365 times as much as the average worker  from the same company so a CEO makes 365  times as much as the worker in his  company in America and there you can see  the polarization of of capital right and  I think Sam openselves in a great speech  I watched the other day on I think it  was uh some show in San Francisco he  said there's really only two assets here  right one is property land and the other  one is capital and and companies right  and so if we are to distribute that  fairly we have to talk about new rules  we have to talk about taxes I'm I would  be all for the automation tax we have to  talk about public benefits of this and  this is a very very loaded policy  question and that question is going to  pop up everywhere we can have exclusive  growth based on AI and Technology uh for  the top 10 which I obviously belong to  and many of you as well so we would like  that but everybody else gets the short  end of the stake by having less work  maybe even for the same money and the  sort of digital feudalism has been  described in many books and also in my  speeches we can't have that that creates  friction which creates War which creates  you know misery for all of us so very  big challenge we have to move to a sort  of a digital sustainable capitalism  all right uh hence my whole idea about  people plan that purpose and prosperity  which I'm not going to talk about now  because it would take another hour or so  so I want to thank you very much for  being part of this it's been a great  pleasure you will see some of the past  shows at Gert talks gerd talks.com I'm  going to put this up there as well it's  just a micro site but of course if you  go to my blog futuriversgaret.com you  see everything there if you haven't seen  my book there technology versus Humanity  it's six years old but it feels like  yesterday I was just reading a chapter  of it the other day I was thinking like  gee you know I should make an update on  this but have a look at my book if you  feel like um you know buying a Christmas  present no that was last year no more  Christmas presents so thanks very much  for tuning in if you have any ideas as  to Future girl talks let me know what  what I should talk about I love this  topic of AI in the future of it and I  hope it was a nice and balanced  conversation I do appreciate all of you  hanging around and watching and asking  all the questions thanks very much live  long and prosper stay human stay hungry
