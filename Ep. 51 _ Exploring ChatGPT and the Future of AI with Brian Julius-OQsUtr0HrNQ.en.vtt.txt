 okay welcome everyone to the analytic  mind podcast I am joined by Ryan Julius  it's awesome to have you on um Brian and  being been too long been too long since  we last had you on and way too long I  think I think I was I was episode number  one so yeah it's been it's been a lot of  a lot of episodes gone by since then I  know and you've even you've even held um  you've even run a few of them so  um you know really appreciate that but  in my opinion I think that we should  chat more that is my my honest opinion  we should chat more regularly there's  just so much going on  um externally with just power bi and  also Power Platform and also a lot of  these other technologies that we're  getting into at Enterprise DNA and also  internally with all of the a lot of  exciting initiatives that that we're  trying to uh roll out ourselves so to me  there's just so much we should talk  about more often and I think the  listeners would really enjoy it  um I think we've got some pretty awesome  topics today that we've noted down that  we can chat about  um one thing I will say is unfortunately  this will be just slightly shorter than  normal because I have something that I  have to run to uh in about 40 minutes or  so but I think we'll be able to cover  quite quite a bit even in that time  so yeah it's funny you mentioned that  Sam because I um there's a lot of times  when we're chatting just you and you and  I and by the end of it I think wow that  would have been a good podcast like we  yeah we covered a lot of stuff and so  yeah I think you know having our regular  chats kind of with the mic turned on  would be great I think I think that's  what we should do yeah instead of um  just having our chats on on teams we  should just push record and uh and and  you know structure it around around a  podcast I mean that to me that makes a  lot of sense because we always I think  Phil quite uh quite rejuvenated and  excited about about the future every  time we're chatting about data related  things that are going on in the markets  or things that we're doing internally so  yeah we've got to do it we've got to do  it in any case I I think the first topic  and you know the most  exciting then globally at the moment is  this chat GPT and how this I mean it  impacts so much it's absolutely insane  um but  I think more than anyone you've probably  done more testing on how this actually  can interact with your or affect your  power bi workflow your power bi  development and so my question is what  was your first impressions  and how have they evolved  um over over the recent days since  they've started using it  yeah my first impression was I was I was  knocked out by it I mean I I just I was  feeding it questions you know really  specific questions  um like you know I was having it right  particular M code functions I was  feeding it kind of the The Narrative  version of the Excel bi nightly uh Power  query challenges so like for one that  was like you know  um write a function write an M function  that will count the number of vowels in  a text string  and it just it pauses for a sec and then  it just starts writing code and the code  it writes is not perfect yet but it is  shockingly good in some cases you know I  mean there was there was  um in that case it it used a function  that didn't actually exist  um but with a couple of changes the  general structure of what it wrote was  excellent I mean it used a list  accumulate structure which is one of the  more complex structures in M code and I  was kind of knocked out by it and then I  I had it run a I said you know in R  write a um  code for a common Garden of Smirnoff  um  non-parametric test with a post-hoc  dones test and a bond for only  correction and Bam it just it just  banged out the the code for that  perfectly and  um  yeah I I was I was I was really taken  with it initially you know and the more  the more I played with the more I  realized you know there's still some  some limitations but the  the difference between Googling  an answer and then running an answer  through chat GPT I think it it just  shows the potential of what this thing  can be and at first I was like oh this  is you know for anybody who's in  education this is there's a problem  um and the more the more I thought about  the more I thought you know I really  I don't think that's I don't think  that's true and you and I chatted about  it and it was like  like any other tool you've got to know  how to use it and I think there's still  going to be a a real role for  educational providers and content  providers to teach people how to use it  properly like any other tool  um so I I'm I'm you know there's kind of  a backlash online about it now you know  people say no when you dig you scratch a  little bit into it there's really not as  much there as you thought but I'm still  seeing a lot of potential for this  but I'm in this just the first  generation I mean right  it's only going to get better and think  about it this it's it's general purpose  right now so what if you what happens  when everyone starts applying this to  very like the very Niche cases like you  know and for those of you who don't  realize is that  um uh GPS can actually write Dax it can  write M I can write R I can write Python  and write all the languages it helps you  write all of the code that you possibly  could could create  yeah um and that is like phenomenal  absolutely phenomenal and it's something  that internally we've always tried to  recreate or we've tried to recreate with  our code libraries and the analyst Hub I  mean that is like a  um  um you know that's that's like a horse  like the analyst Hub now is like a horse  pulling a carriage you know versus like  some Supercar  um with with what chat GPT can do but in  saying that and saying that one thing I  have realized through discussions with  Brian but also watching a ton of like  YouTube videos of others using it like  other developers who might work in other  languages is that it doesn't you still  need to know how to architect you need  to act it takes away the the sort of  grunt work but you still need to know  how to architect a solution and  um you know so no one's jobs going  anywhere in my in my opinion this is  just going to be an enabler it's gonna  it's gonna bring more scale into what  we're doing right so you know it's just  gonna it's just gonna enable more  reports to be created better reports to  be created more optimized reports to be  created right  um I don't think it's you can't build it  itself just yet but I mean I wouldn't I  wouldn't count against that happening at  some point  um but uh that that is that is what is  it it is really enabling is scale speed  and so I think you know from our  perspective is um we're gonna we're  gonna lean in here I think I think it's  an amazing tool and  you know we will um we should really  create content around how you could  actually use it to architect a solution  faster you know we've always we're  always about fast  um development you know really to try to  keep things simple and effective uh and  this this could just be one of those um  tools that you can use to to actually  enable that  you know I've always I've always thought  Googling is a skill you know and it's  like I mean I have a lot of Solutions on  the Forum and some of those Solutions  are just because I Googled better than  the person asking the question you know  and it's like I was able to find the you  know the answer to some obscure thing  and you know I think in in some respects  this is is very similar in that  what you ask it and how you ask it and  how you follow up in probe  um  matters in terms of the answer you get  back and so I think kind of being a good  user and consumer of this is just like  you know learning the tricks of of  Googling well and um you know yeah I  think we definitely want to want to dive  in and you know kind of provide some  learnings and best practices and you  know kind of incorporate that into our  into our teaching so yeah I completely  agree I I think it's I I think it's  amazing I mean I just didn't see this  coming in terms of how sophisticated the  the AI was and you know how advanced it  was at this point  yeah I mean what what like I was  um as I was reading I'm reading a lot  about it  um yeah to me this is like a  a technology a technological moment in  time where there's the realization that  these AI engines can can really actually  change the world like they that you know  maybe everyone I think already has  already known that but now we can see it  right and I don't think it is going to  hurt anyone's role or job if you lean  into it because all it's going to enable  is is for you to become when you're  getting you're going to have more  superpowers you're going to be able to  learn Technologies quicker  um and so you know instead what it could  actually mean is that there becomes far  more power bi developers than there ever  could have been in the past because you  know maybe there was some  um  um you know mental challenges of of like  learning encode and Dex to to actually  really master power but it could really  double triple quadruple the amount of  people who you actually use in develop  inside of power bi same with any other  language like if if I think of myself  personally and I think about you know  wanting to Learn Python extensively for  example right that to me is still  daunting for the vast majority of people  right but or or learning how to use apis  or some of these other like key  Technologies like some of these or even  getting into crypto you know like all of  these things seem so daunting these  languages you have to learn but if you  can have a ever have a bot that  um or an AI that just advises you along  the way and you become just the overall  architect I mean imagine these  superpowers that you you could  eventually happen and how that could be  compounded by millions of people  worldwide I mean that is just so  exciting so exciting and you know yes it  seems like wow this could just take over  the world but I think it's just going to  empower the world  you know I I had a similar reaction when  I when I first saw it it made me think  back to when Steve Jobs did the original  roll out of the iPhone and I watched  that you know as it happened and I  thought  I don't even understand what the  implications of this are but I know  they're huge and it's kind of the same  thing when this dropped it's like you  know where this goes in a year and three  years and five years I I have no idea  except  this feeling that things definitely  changed at that point  yeah  yeah change for everyone change for  businesses individuals I mean I think  you've gotta you've got to be aware of  it you've got to be on top of it  um you know I think I think it says it's  as big as the internet you know like  just the concept of the internet right  like it's someone it's boosting  creativity it's boosting output it's you  know it's a it's a force multiplier and  so yeah  I think it's amazing I really think it's  amazing I mean I I would never have  thought I would enjoy watching YouTube  clips of someone typing into a chat bot  and then seeing coach  code uh code being written but it is it  is mesmerizing absolutely mesmerizing  well it's actually I love I actually  like the way from an interface  standpoint it does it that there's this  this kind of pregnant pause before it it  starts answering and then it gives you  kind of a brief text explanation and  then it goes into that black box and you  just see the code unwind and it's it  it's pretty dramatic if uh you know as  you watch it um yeah but you know one of  the things that I I was surprised about  was the quality of the narrative  explanations like I was asking it things  like you know explain when you would use  measures versus calculated columns and  it really gave it really gave some  is a quite sophisticated answers you  know that weren't just you know kind of  obvious cut and paste  um one of the things I'm really I  haven't tested yet but I'm very curious  about is whether it has any capability  to optimize so if you were to take a Dax  measure and submit it and say you know  um using using Dax right a measure that  does the same thing but performs faster  um can it do that and I you know I have  no doubt at some point it will be able  to but I think that is you know the  ability to use it to optimize code I  think I'm I'm very curious to see  whether it has any capability to do that  I haven't tested that yet  yeah  um  that would be to me I mean that's just  inevitable it's totally new and for  those of you who don't know Microsoft  actually have an investment in open AI  they have a significant investment open  AI uses Microsoft's Azure servers to run  a lot of these  um and so I think they've did some trade  where  um I think I mean I don't know but I I  read uh read once that openai had you  know unlimited access to Microsoft's  server Tech server capabilities or  server infrastructure for X number a  percent of the company so these are  going to be Microsoft is is going to  want to monetize that more down the line  and power bi is their core analytical uh  you know talk so I mean it is just  inevitable it was absolutely inevitable  right so you know it's got to get into  it got to get into it it's super super  exciting  I did wonder what their Cloud bill was  going to be because it's like I saw over  the weekend it's like in five days they  had a million people and there were a  couple times this weekend I tried to get  on and it was it was  you couldn't get on it you know it was  it was  capacity over overrun question on that  what do you think do you do you do you  believe that this could happen to  Google's dominance  you know I'm I'm kind of bad at  predicting that stuff but you know I I  kind of looked the first thing I did was  looked at Google stock price last week  and I saw that it was down like seven  and a half percent for the week and I  thought well clearly I'm not the first  one to think that Google is going to  have problems with this  um you know I think a lot of it kind of  depends on what open AI does with it do  they go with an ad supported model and  make it public and try to be a  competitor to Google whether they go  with a subscription model where it  becomes a kind of a high cost high-end  you know add-on service you know I I  don't know what they're going to do from  a business standpoint and so I think the  choice they make will will really  Drive whether this ends up kind of  competing right in the teeth of Google  or not yeah I I I if I was to tell you  my own personal View and based on what  I've seen how can I do in the past open  AI charge on from from a API point of  view so they charge you for every time  you  um uh you  um submit a query or something what I  think is going to happen is I think if I  was to really try and be futuristic here  which I'm not always the best at that  um I think they're going to empower the  rest of the internet  to compete with Google right Google  kills it because they've got the best  search engine right they they put in  front of you the best answers at the  best time out of out of anyone they have  for a long time right and they just  absolutely dominate that but open AI is  going to enable any website to have that  literally any website will be able to  have that right and so we could have  maybe a better version of that yeah  maybe a more a niche down version right  like maybe you can get a model which  trains just on Dax and just on M or  something  um and it's going to empower in my view  other websites so that you won't have to  go back to Google every time to get an  answer say you came to our website and  we we connected the API well you could  query for very specific Dax questions  and we could be like the  um the power bi bot for you and you  didn't wouldn't have to go back and  Google and Google and Google and so it  has a number of permutations a number  the reason why I think that is because  to build the infrastructure that Google  have created I mean I've read I've read  books that and and  um articles where people think that that  it would almost be impossible to  recreate the model that they have  created like it would cost you too much  too much of infrastructure costs  um knowledge you know ad Network all of  that just too complicated like you just  could not recreate it  um but  a distribution model of just giving your  API out to everyone and just enabling  you to connect to the API so that other  websites can compete better  that seems very double I mean they  already do it so that to me is what I  think is going to happen and so that's  exciting for us like we we want to lean  in here we need to have that connection  all lined up as soon as it's ready to go  so that users can come to our search  they can search through our content but  also they can search through very  specific questions that you know almost  almost turn our support Forum into  literally that bot turn it into the box  and then we would we that would cover  like um that would cover 80 to 90 of  questions and then the the final 10  might be just like architecting things  like build model related related things  um so I I mean to me that's that's damn  exciting  yeah you know I I I think there's so  much going on that you know as I I post  died last night you know it's just like  the world changed in a week you know on  a lot of different dimensions and you  know it's kind of I I find that hugely  exciting you know to just see where  where all this takes us and we're kind  of continuing to evolve our offerings  and you know it all kind of plays in the  into all that so yeah I'm I'm you know  I'm very excited about and it's like if  you think about the fact that  the the millions of people using this  and probably the billions of you know  queries that are getting fed through  it's like the training and the learning  that's going to go on and this is just  going to be you know kind of exponential  so yeah exciting stuff  yeah  also like sorry to go on to the point as  well I think that also the model of of  Google is is truly being broken down  because if you think about it everyone  who has a website has been a supplier to  Google for a long time you're supplying  them content so that you can get traffic  from Google right so we're just  suppliers really we're content suppliers  but if you if you don't need to be a  supplier anymore because you can just  give the content to someone when they're  on their website it just really changes  things right it's like you know do you  need if you can get someone onto your  website by any other means other than  Google and keep them on there  you know do you need to be a Google  supplier anymore so it's very very  interesting very very interesting  um okay let's move on let's move on I I  really it's a really fascinating chat  and maybe we'll get about it again but  um we can move on if you like yeah and  you know the the open AI thing I mean  the thing that we didn't even talk about  was Dolly and um you know I think I  think that that is a whole nother Game  Changer from the standpoint of you know  the the idea of  AI created  pictures and  um you know illustrations and art and  you know I know for a post I did the  other night I was looking for a a  particular thing and the only thing I  could find was Getty Images and um you  know I didn't want to pay a royalty for  a LinkedIn post and so I just went to  Dolly and had it generate a photo  realistic I said I need a picture of  glass doors  padlocked with heavy chains  and it created a perfect picture with no  royalty you know I said photorealistic  style and you know I'm sure when you  when you look at that post it looks like  a photograph of a of a bank that's been  you know been seized and locked and um  you know that that in and of itself is  remarkable and we're not even really  talking about that because you know chat  GPT has kind of taking the the  conversation over but you know there  there are so many other things going on  in the in the AI world that I think are  going to influence  you know our our work and you know just  kind of general you know education  content in  Myriad of different ways  yeah yeah  that's that's incredible it's really  this year hasn't this the last couple of  years yeah maybe the last like the last  12 months  absolutely absolutely incredible  um cool okay let's move on it's such an  interesting topic we could probably talk  for hours on it  um  but uh what's what's what's your  thinking about some of the recent power  bi updates give me give me give me give  me a few highlights and and for for  listeners  um the few things that are exciting you  it's always interesting because I I look  at it I always look at the the monthly  update and I think what is my first  reaction of the thing that is going to  be the big winner on this and then how  does that square with  what actually happens as we as we use  the updates and kind of incorporate the  functions in our day-to-day development  and I'll give you a kind of an example a  while back was that they um when they  came out with the custom buttons  it was kind of like the third thing on  the list and it wasn't like a big hoopla  there was some other big thing that came  out that month that everybody was  excited about and from my standpoint in  terms of what's really influenced  my development that custom button and  icon and  um you know the the ability to tie those  you know to actions and to format those  in different ways that's had a huge  impact and you know at the time it was  kind of like okay custom buttons and  icons cool  um and so similarly last for the  November update you know the one that  had been  really anticipated was evaluating log  and this was a function that they had  previewed Jeffrey Wayne had written some  great blog articles about it  um in in kind of preview mode and um it  finally rolled out in in November and um  I I thought I was going to be super  excited about it and there were two  other functions that rolled out one  called two Json and one called two CSV  and um  and  there wasn't any Fanfare on those you  know and there was a lot of talk on  online about okay I don't know what  these are cool but what do we do with  them and it was basically outputting  your Dax measures to a Json format or to  a CSV and we started playing around with  them and all of a sudden evaluating log  which became which was kind of the the  big debugging  um innovation  I kind of dropped that one and realized  that two Json and two  um  to CSV are amazing you know that they  they let us do things that we've never  been able to do except using external  tools like tabular editor Dax Studio  which was to Output  the the result of a measure to a table  you know the measures the the kind of  law of Dax is that measures return  scalars and there have been ways to kind  of subtly cheat that with concatenate X  and unicar 10 but there's never been a  way to directly return a table from a a  measure and that  you know you can do it in a Dax query  mode with external tools but we started  playing around with this and all of a  sudden realized oh my God you can  dynamically in your power bi report have  tables materialized as the result of  measures and that to me that just blew  my mind and it's like for from a  debugging standpoint and an  understanding of what Dax is doing  internally that's that's the best thing  I've seen in daxed all year I mean in  power bi all year  um and it's a function that's barely  documented nobody's really talking about  it and to me it's like  you know we we started talking about it  at the accelerator that we did um last  week and there was a  um a participant um Henrik westergard  um who had done some experimentation on  his own and he messaged me during the  the accelerator and we we collaborated  and I I posted on this and he's got some  really sharp ways of doing this in terms  of formatting and um outputting you know  that to make it really really usable in  the in the output and um you know so  that one to me was a game changer and  then  um just this week  um Microsoft dropped the December update  which I wasn't expecting until later in  the month and there are three new  functions in that which are offset index  and window  which let you I mean you know you and I  have talked a lot about over you know  over the years that were huge fans of  the offsets that Melissa de Corte uses  in her extended day table and so kind of  using that as a way to to  basically run an easier version of all  the time intelligence functions but the  downside is you have to use a day table  that incorporates those those offsets  and this set of functions basically  I've only been playing with it for a  couple of days but  it lets you do all that dynamically  easily within within Dax measures  um you know create these offsets in a  virtual way use them and not have to  materialize them as as physical columns  and  they're I I think there's some  incredible use for this you know so I I  um I posted about this last night on  LinkedIn you know we're running some  test examples I mean interestingly right  before this um  this podcast Greg Deckler had posted  um a video I haven't been able to make  it all the way through that yet because  we had to jump on here but he's got a  little different view on it you know he  and I usually are very much in agreement  on things and I think we  he's a he's a bit less bullish on these  than I am but I I think I think these  have huge potential to be very  consequential in the way we do Dax so  you know there's a lot going on in power  bi that I think is you know definitely  kudos to the the Dax development team  that they're they're giving us some  great new capabilities  yeah you know I've got a good um  yeah it's good stuff it's good stuff  um again I I would I would happily admit  I haven't I haven't tested them out  extensively myself  um  um due to other other focuses but yeah I  mean I I I get a feeling I mean I and  one of my  um recent  um podcasts uh was was it was Chris  Chris Chris  Yeah Yeah Chris Webb  the general just there was that the  power bi team know that power bi is  still too hard  um and and is not giving everyone  um you know is it is empowering a ton of  people no doubt about it but there's  Millions tens of millions more that they  can Empower if they can make it easier  and so you know whilst whilst these are  new functions being laid onto many other  functions you know  um things like debugging decks has been  notoriously difficult  um has been you know things like  um various uh date table  configurations and Analysis on  non-standard tables I mean it's just too  difficult it's too hard for the everyday  user right and so wherever they can I  think they're trying to  um you know give users options to get to  um what they need and  um yeah with all these changes it's upon  us to  um to to also help that you know push  that direction get the user what they  get users of power bi what they want and  when when they need it and also Empower  it and enable faster speed and scale and  how they execute on it  you know it's interesting because I  think oftentimes when Microsoft tries to  make things easier for beginning users  they just make it worse for everybody  and I think there are some horrendous  features that need to be shut off or  gotten rid of you know that the auto  detector relationships I think is the  worst feature in the program Auto auto  day time is terrible  um  there there are some other things  they've done you know I think the the I  I think basically implicit measures are  very wrong-headed  um and are not a good  are not a good route for for users to go  down  um I think the natural explain it unless  it measures just favor so so basically  rather than so in the in the in the  field well when you click on  um a a column you can you can have that  aggregate within the co within the the  field well so you can you can add an  average or a sum and you doing that  rather than just writing a simple  measure is just the in my mind there's  never an advantage of doing that totally  yeah other than doing some you know  really quick and dirty debug checks but  it's so easy to write those those core  measures and you know I and you do it  you do it through you know kind of  pulling it in on your template I do it  through scripting in  um in tabulator I mean I literally have  one script that writes all my my basic  measures it'll write 15 of them at a  time and or or more  um I think NJ Park had a um a great  video where he um  he he created like a hundred measures in  like 30 seconds  um you know just basic measures that he  he was going to use and scripted and so  you know there's easy ways to do that  properly and I just think  some of the attempts to make Power bi  easier just make it worse and actually  lead beginners down a very bad track and  you know I think for example the you  know the and it's just a preview feature  and maybe it gets better you know it  kind of goes back to the AI thing but  the natural language Dax  just doesn't work at this point you know  I think somebody tested it on  um  on Ruth's uh 25 days of Dax and it it  missed 22 of 25  um answers you know and that's just  never going to be close to good enough  and um  but I think you know on the flip side  you know when I look at what I think  they're really doing right is not to try  to make things automatic but to make  things transparent and I think these  these new to Json function to CSV I  think the index and  um  an offset and window  make Dax easier to see what's going on  behind the scenes and to me that's a  much more productive way to go if the  thing that makes Jax hard is  that you can't in some cases break it  down within context and see what Dax is  doing you've got to kind of visualize it  in your head and that's hard to do for I  mean that that's hard to do for us and  it's certainly almost impossible for a  beginning user to do and so being able  to see on screen what your intermediate  calculations are doing  um to me is a huge plus and I think it's  gonna it's gonna change the way not just  people debug Dax but I think the way  they learn Dax you know you can just put  a a measure up that just shows what your  intermediate tables are doing it just it  becomes so much clearer as you as you  step through your slicer and you step  through your your tables to be able to  see that and so  um I'm using it extensively and I I kind  of think it's one of those things if we  can show beginning users  how to do that it'll make it'll make the  the program much clearer and so you know  some of the things I think I'm quite  critical of that Microsoft's doing but I  think some of the things they're doing  is fantastic  yeah no I agree totally great totally  great um okay so let's move on to this  last last key item that I wanted to  cover before I need to I need to run  unfortunately  um  we've got some exciting things going on  we've got some exciting things happening  at Enterprise DNA and behind the scenes  I mean we've had I was I was trying to  describe the year uh Enterprise DNA's  Year to my um in-laws yesterday actually  and I was I was saying I was thinking  it's been been let's call it a  transformative year whether it really  transforms what we've um what we're what  we're what we are and what we want to be  um you know at Enterprise DNA this year  and but it doesn't stop it doesn't stop  we've got more things that we want to do  um and we're constantly thinking about  how you know we can Empower you know use  users around not only Power bi now but  also various other tools around the  power bi ecosystem power automate power  apps python R  um SQL Excel  so  we've obviously been really branching  out on our content but we've got some  other things in the works and maybe  maybe  um you know a lot of these have been  um your creativity that has sort of  brought constructed them so do you want  to maybe maybe let everyone you know  give a little bit of a sneak peek on  what we're thinking about  yeah so we've got we got a we've got a  whole bunch of stuff coming um you know  the first thing is you know just  coursework that um we've got an amazing  array of stuff coming up we've got I  think I've tallied up and we've got 15  new courses that are going to be coming  out in the next three months and you  know everything from you know  certification courses we've kind of  dived in on Excel which is historically  something we had not done a lot of  content on we've got some great Excel  series as well as you know kind of a  full Excel certification  um series coming you know dp500  certification on the heels of the the pl  300  um course so you know coursework is is  is always a big part in kind of making  making sure that you know we're always  talking to our subscribers and you know  kind of saying okay we're we're the gaps  in in what you need and filling those  with with new courses  um from you know great instructors and  experts  um but I think for me you know  two things that come to mind you know  one of which is the platform itself  um you know that  when Enterprise DNA started you know it  was a it was a platform that you had put  together you know kind of using some  off-the-shelf parts using some you know  Custom Custom Design and  it was great for its time but I think as  we we got more complex and we more  content and more functionality it kind  of outgrew that platform and I think you  know kind of the way in which you kind  of burned that to the ground this year  and rebuilt it entirely from scratch I  think it just it opens the door for us  to do  a million things we could not do on the  old platform and I'm super excited about  that and so you know one of the things  is  we've really  I think you know courses and training  and webinars are great but you got to  practice you know I think you've always  been you know proponent that you know  until you get in and get your hands  dirty and do it yourself you're not  really fully learning it  and uh can I just stop in there for one  second and I do want to say Brian I  think that Enterprise DNA along those  lines was the first to create a  challenge program we were the first  and um that was because of that very  reason now every every damn person on  Earth has copied us but  um that leads into into our new our  newest idea  and you know I I still think you know  the the the challenge serves a great  purpose and I think  um it's there's very few learning  opportunities that are as rich as  building a  a report start to finish  um in community getting comments on that  seeing how other people address the same  report and I think you know from a  career standpoint  um there is no better investment you can  make than to build out a great portfolio  and I think one of the things that I run  into all the time with people is they  say well how do I build a great  portfolio if all my work examples are  confidential  and you know my my answer is you know I  think one of the things you can do  sometimes is you can mock up the data  and kind of use your your work Report  with non-confidential data but even that  in some cases isn't possible and so the  way I've seen people do it and the way  I've done it myself and actually what  led  you to get to know me and recognize you  know  my potential to come on board was  participation in the challenges and um  and so you know I see over and over  again the ability of people to  build careers and build recognition by  participating challenges getting that  out on social media  um but I think we for me one of the  light bulb moments this year was  um the Excel bi nightly Challenge and  you know one of my goals I always said  learning goals for myself and one of  them was to get better with em code this  year I knew I knew my encoding wasn't up  to Snuff and I really wanted to improve  that and so  um about four months ago Vijay Verma um  started posting these nightly challenges  and I jumped in on those and there's a  whole community of us that you know for  me it's at about 11 30 P.M every night  it posts and everybody jumps on and  starts doing these and I've  I've  gotten  orders of magnitude better from just  four months of every night banging out  code and I've learned from the people in  the community and we've actually  enterprised DNA has partnered with Vijay  so we we're an official partner of excel  bi and that gives us the right to  basically use all of the examples for  teaching and for  um you know challenges and for you know  kind of  to help our subscribers kind of Leverage  the great work that he's done but I  think what we what you and I talked  about was really hey that model works  for everything  um you know we can we can do data  modeling we can do Dax we can do you  know power query at a less advanced  level than what BJ's doing for for  beginning users we can do visualization  we can do all sorts of things that you  know somebody can jump in and say okay  what do I need to get better at and  maybe for somebody you know it's not  power query or encoding it's it's Dax or  it's improving their their visualization  skills or it's you know they want to  learn deneb  um and being able to jump in and say  Here's an exercise you know there are  multiple exercise per week you can kind  of jump in and you know when you and I  were chatting about it you know the  thing that kind of came to my mind was a  a gym or a workout facility where you  you know you're not you're not committed  to you know running a marathon but  you're committed to going to the gym  banging out 45 minutes of hard hard work  you know going home going on with your  life and then doing it again in a couple  of days and over the course of a period  you just get stronger and you know kind  of develop greater ability and I think  that's really what we want to do with  this and so we I think we're we're very  close to  um you know to getting that rolled out  and we're again kind of scanning the The  Horizon for our experts and some  external experts to run these these  different workouts and so  um yeah I'm I'm gonna be running some of  them I I think um I'm going to be not  only running some I'm gonna be doing  some of them you know that I'm you know  I'm already not sleeping that much  anyway and I think I'm going to be  sleeping less you know staying up doing  you know denim Challenge and doing Dax  challenges and so  um yeah super excited about this yeah I  mean I'm so pumped as well I mean and  the idea came from came from just out of  thin air of you know how do we how do we  impact more how do we impact more data  analysts every week that's that that was  kind of my my vision and then the  workouts idea I think is just brilliant  right it's like you're going in for a  short workout  um do some reps and then and then and  then you're done and then you can you  know go on with your day you know you're  you're just slowly building up  um building up the muscle memory right  like that that's that's kind of the  that's kind of the idea and I think I  think it's it's exciting on multiple  fronts because we're we're really going  to expand across multiple different  languages and Technologies so you know  where it's not just power bi here it's  going to be a whole raft of different  um uh different streams and uh also it's  going to be completely integrated into  various aspects of our platform so  you'll be able to earn points you'll be  able to Showcase your portfolio of um  submissions to to your workouts uh We've  even got a portfolio feature that we're  really thinking hard about that will  bring together your challenge  submissions your workout submissions  um your certificates your certifications  all into this one public page that you  can showcase and you know that that to  me is  in combination  quite transformative so I've gone from a  transformative year 2022 and I think  we're going to do it again we're going  to do it again and this is just going to  be one of the first things we do around  that  um  Brian I'm very sorry but I I do actually  have to  um wind things wind things up and we  just haven't had had enough time that's  why we need to do it  it needs anytime anytime you want I'm  I'm happy to have more I love talking  about this stuff and uh there's there's  so much to  you know the changes in the course of a  given week there's always going to be  going to be interesting stuff to chat  about so happy to do it yeah sounds good  sounds good okay  um thank you very much thank you very  much Brian thanks all for tuning in and  sorry we had to wrap up early but um  yeah we'll we'll get some more of this  uh more of this chit chat um and and  discussions uh out to you because yeah I  think I think it's good we probably  don't actually talk enough about what's  going on internally at Enterprise DNA  and probably most of our listeners are  our Enterprise DNA users so  um yeah so so I think I think I think  that's a good a good thing to cover more  more often as well okay yeah we got some  big stuff we didn't even hit on so we  got we got material for the next one  already yeah awesome awesome okay thanks  Brian thanks all talk to you next time  foreign  [Music]
