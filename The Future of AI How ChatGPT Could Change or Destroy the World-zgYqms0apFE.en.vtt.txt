 hello and welcome back to my channel my  name is Carson and I want to talk to you  today about Ai and how it's going to  change everything  if you haven't heard about AI yet  specifically around chat GPT  um this is a new program that was made  available a couple weeks ago from a open  AI so this is a company that works on  artificial intelligence and they've  opened this up to the public and all you  need to do to access it is to create an  account and then you can play around  with this yourself  but what this tool actually allows you  to do is it's like Google search with  um Google search plus that's a good way  to describe it so if you just Google  Search right now you say  um you know give me ideas for an essay  that I need to write about this or  sometimes you can put in very specific  questions and you'll get a specific  answer so but typically it's a little  bit more General and you have to go in  consume the content understand the  content and then push that content uh or  synthesize that information yourself and  use it as you need  however with chat GPT it has the ability  to take its vast amount of information  or data that's already available to it  synthesize that data down into a way  that is easy to understand and usable  for the average person it can also write  things like programs it can code for you  so I'm just taking the moment to  appreciate that there is now something  that is generally available for  everybody out there that can program for  you that can write essays for you that  can write business plans business models  that it can write YouTube scripts for  you it can do just about anything that  you want now there is some ethical  concerns to come along with that to make  sure that we're not all just copy and  pasting what chat and GPT can do for us  but there is a million different ways to  make money from this there's tons of  videos going around about that  there's also  um what I start to think about which is  how this is going to impact the overall  economic output of individuals and just  the system that we're in as we generally  are with a lot of people working nine to  five some are business owners but we're  all in the same kind of economy and  trying to learn how to best  pretty much add value to that economy  now  let me go into saying that I think chat  chat GPT is the beginning of a  revolution that will change the world I  genuinely believe that I think that  there is going to be some incredible  incredible things that come from this  there's also other AI programs out there  like Jasper AI  um that can take  pretty much a bunch of inputs that you  have say you wanted to make an image for  you so you can say I would like an image  of a blue dinosaur in space driving a  Tesla specifically maybe around Mars  and it would generate these images for  you and you can adjust them change them  around and this is something that has  never been available before in the same  way we've had tools that were created  like word or Excel or some of these  um software tools but it required our  input to be able to create now Chad gbt  is going to work like an AI assistant  that can probably perform not probably  that's that's an understatement  it can most definitely perform the role  of a true assistant for you in almost  whatever job that you have it can  automate emails which looking here on  Twitter there's  um apis that you can do so pretty much  just integrates over into a different  program  um and the AI can actually write out  different email responses for you it can  self-generate all this content that you  need you can go and say I would like you  to research all of the different  businesses that fit this following  criteria X Y and Z that maybe it's a  under 20 man operation that's been in  business for over 10 years that has a  significant client base maybe a good  social media following and I would like  you to write out a prospecting email to  book a meeting to sell whatever service  it is that I have to this person or to  this business and use the best contact  information you have for them now I will  make the caveat that this is only up to  date uh limited knowledge of the world  and events after 21  however if you're doing this to say I'm  looking for all of the local  um I don't know um  what's a good example like a local  plumbing companies well if you go back  to 2021 that information technically  would still be there and be available  for you you can do this with like MLS  listings now that can be another weird  one because there's you know you know  newer listings than 2021 so just be  aware of that but I think for a lot of  people this is going to be game changing  if you're able to get on top of it go  explore try things out try typing  different things into chat GPT and see  what it can do for you if you're in a  job where specific knowledge for example  if you have customers coming to you  constantly wanting customer feedback a  customer support and service when you  can have chat GPT  um build you itself which is really  interesting because it can program but  you can actually build an uh a chat bot  that can use chat gbt with the  information that you provide for it say  your terms of service for your business  you can have your return policies if you  sell products your fees associated with  it and they can go and interact with  this bot ask the questions that they  need and all of those kind of General  FAQs that you go to or different forms  for if you can have that as a feel kind  of back and forth with a with a customer  the the level of service that you're  able to provide them can be that much  better and you actually haven't been  involved in that process at all there's  some crazy crazy ways that this can be  applied and utilized that I think is  um  it's being sleeped on right now A lot of  people are sleeping on it that's for  sure so this is something to get your  hands on right now go and type in a  million different things that you can  better understand if you are in customer  service how can how can I improve my  customer service if you want to start a  business how can I build a online  business that's going to make me 10  grand a month what's something that's  scalable that way how do I work on my  personal finances hey these are my  measurements and body kind of uh body  composition what's a good workout plan  for me  you can do just about anything with this  so I have here um read out a 200 word  rationale on why AI will change the way  that everything  um at the way everyone does work in the  coming years  um uh in point form okay  boom here it goes so this isn't working  in real time again this is a tool that  is available in Access accessible for  everybody out there this is incredible  on my YouTube channel typically we're  talking about crypto we're looking at  what's going on in the the crypto space  but this was so important and so  mind-blowing that I needed to make a  video myself about what is going on with  AI because you can make a ton of money  from it you can generate a lot of  content and this is a tool that  everybody needs to use  okay so  um AI has the ability to automate tasks  and processes freeing up time for human  workers to focus on more high-level  creative work that in itself is  incredible all those repetitive tasks  that you have to do data entry and time  consuming  um entry or information that you need to  do for your job well if you better  understand this technology you can  probably come up with ways to automate  that incredible yeah I can analyze data  and make decisions faster more  accurately than humans enabling  businesses to operate more efficiently  and effectively so if you think about  there is a bunch of information coming  back from the market with regards to  what products are selling better from  your website or from your corporate job  and to be able to say okay we know that  and can anticipate some changes in  Market condition because of X Y and Z  maybe some tariffs that are coming which  which of our products are going to be  impact by said tariffs or by sanctions  or by  um you know the cost of Labor is  increasing so we know that the what  consumer goods that I have on my website  are going to increase in those  manufacturing costs or can we anticipate  a increase in manufacturing costs from  that you can make some really good  decisions because you have the if you  have the data and you have the ability  to kind of bring AI into it so I'm not  going to go through each of these but I  think this is really incredible  um that's going on right now and I want  to jump over to Twitter there's a few  things here as I mentioned with the  email assistant so you can send emails  off I really like there's a chat and GPT  add-on that you can add into Chrome  which will just allow you to when you go  to Google and you type something in so  how to start and grow an online business  it will generate this here so starting  growing an online business can be  rewarding and exciting Venture but it  requires careful planning and execution  here are some steps you can follow to  grow your online business  and fill this out identify your target  market develop a business plan choose a  business model set up your website build  your marketing and sales strategy launch  and grow kind of what that looks like so  typically you just get your little kind  of blurbs over here a ton of ads all the  way down but this is actually giving you  kind of a more of a in-depth view on  that which I think is incredible you can  even ask it from book summaries whatever  you want  now over here if you just go on Twitter  um shout out to Elon Musk for you know  making Twitter just incredible as it is  um you can go over here follow open AI  so these are the developers of this this  program I think it's important to note  that openai's mission is to insert  ensure that artificial general  intelligence uh  artificial general intelligence benefits  all of humanity and we're hiring so boom  go hop on that  um so I think there's some really really  incredible pieces out there  um and I think this is something you  can't be sleeping on you need to go look  at it you need to go look at  um what it offers what it does and go  mess around with it type in  um how uh you know write me a 500 word  essay on why  um Mr Beast will uh next billionaire  um in  10 years I don't know  okay so this is a great example of why  whatever you type in needs to be  something that makes sense so you can't  do that  um so that's really interesting so let's  go back to here let's go  um uh  um what are  what is the best way to  uh actually let's ask it about Bitcoin  um  what is Bitcoin and does it have value  okay well I've been like that one either  so let's try one more  okay so now it's not uh giving me any of  those uh responses so let's see  um maybe there's something else here  um  can you explain to me what blockchain  technology  um  okay so I I broke in  um that's kind of funny uh we'll see if  it  okay so I broke so something to go and  mess around with  um try refreshing the page if something  like this pops up  um it's kind of interesting that I broke  it there it's not perfect but it is the  beginning of some incredible changes  that are coming to the Creator economy  um our individual jobs get on top of  this go research it Go understand it Go  learn it this will save you and make you  tens to hundreds to millions of dollars  if you utilize the tools you have now  and available for you like watch this  stuff if you've been watching my videos  about  um Bitcoin or  cryptocurrency in general you can ask it  a ton of questions about that you can  ask it about  here's the white paper for something  copy and paste that information in and  say here's some questions that I have  about this is this described in the  white paper you can do some incredibly  valuable things and pull out some  incredible insights and information that  you couldn't in any other way shape or  form before without spending hundreds of  hours going through stuff you have an  incredibly powerful tool like your  fingertips and if you do not utilize it  somebody else will and you will miss out  on this so get on top of it don't forget  to like subscribe share this with your  friends on what chat GPT is and what it  can do for you go do a bunch of research  get involved and let me know Below in  the comments if there's any kind of  questions that you've uh have with  regards to AI what you think it's going  to do in the coming years and  um yeah I look forward to hearing from  you all and I'm sure I'm going to be  streaming or sorry I should say posting  more videos uh regularly especially  about stuff like this also if you're  interested you can go check out my blog  the financial Divergent so you can  actually just go and
