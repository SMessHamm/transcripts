 hey right riders Keith wheeler here back  with another video for you and today  this one's going to be a little bit  controversial I know because we're going  to be talking about artificial  artificial art artificial intelligence  that's right artificial intelligence and  how we can use artificial intelligence  to help us write good children's picture  books now I know in the title of this  video I talked about chat GPT which is  where we're going to head on over to I  also talked about is it the future of  picture book writing or a threat to  authenticity and that seems to be the  controversy that everybody's talking  about but before we can come up with a  rationale and a decision one way or the  other let's see what we can actually do  with chat GPT so we're going to head on  over there I'm gonna show you exactly  what you can do with chat GPT and  specifically when it comes to writing  and creating children's picture books  let's get started now here we are on  chat gbt and all you have to do is  scroll down here if you don't already  have an account click try chat GPT you  click on that it's going to ask you for  an email address  to log in as you do that it's going to  then send you an email to verify the  email address it's going to ask you your  name so you put your first name your  last name whatever you want to use and  then you'll get to this page and this  page and again this is absolutely free  and then you just right down here it's  got a little icon you just start typing  now it's just like with anything else  that you create what you get in is what  you're going to get out so if you put  hot garbage in you're going to get hot  garbage out so what can you use this for  when it comes to Children's picture  books well maybe you want an idea for a  new book you just want an idea like you  don't even know what you're going to  write about but you do know that you  want it to be you want the main  character to be a turtle so how about  just coming up with it with ideas now  one of the things that you it's all  about how you word things if you want to  create something unique something  specific to what you're going to put in  here then you want to use the word  create but if you want a list or you  want suggestions then you can say  something like list or suggest so for  example if I type in here suggest five  I'm gonna say children's picture book  ideas  see it's going to start telling you uh  books that already exist  okay  so I'm gonna wait till it's over this so  it's again all about what you put in so  I'm going to type down here create five  plots for a children's picture book  about a turtle  named Ted so here we go we've got Ted in  the great race Ted's big adventure Ted's  Incredible Journey Ted in The Secret  Garden and Ted in the lost city and you  can pause this if you want to see what  the actual plot is but as you can see  they're very unique they're each one you  know they're using the The Prompt that I  gave it's about Ted but the rest of it  is all just artificial intelligence it  just pulled it out of The Ether you know  maybe some other story ideas that are  already out there but there you go that  right there I asked for five and I got  five so what if you don't even know that  you want a book about Ted you know maybe  you you don't even know what you want  your children's picture book to be about  so instead of create Let's Do List how  about find  five and I'm only using five because  it's it'll be quicker I mean you could  say 10 20 100 whatever you want find  five picture book Niche ideas  as you can see it's you know in in the  last three it uses the word young  because it is for children uh I would  say that especially if it's come coming  up with titles  uh if you plan on using anything that's  suggested you definitely want to go in  and and do your due diligence and check  Amazon and see if the title already  exists and I would suggest going one  step further if that's the title you  want to use and go and and look up uh  see if it's trademarked and you check  out the trademark on USPTO so we've used  it to come up with just unique picture  book niches you know for for children's  picture book we've also done it to  basically come up with a plot for a  story for you know a turtle children's  picture book that word that we do where  we know the the main character uh you  can also use it for for series names you  know if you've got a collection of books  that you want to do but you want to come  up with a good series title so I said  create a picture book series title for a  series of books about animal characters  that go on adventures  the wild explorers how about that okay  if I don't like that I can just say  regenerate response the Wild Adventures  of whatever  okay I love these the wild explorers  animal Adventures fur fins and Feathers  the brave creatures the Critter  Chronicles try saying that 10 times fast  so there you go you know you can use it  to come up with book Series titles one  of the things that I really love about  chat GPT and other artificial  intelligence is it allows us to very  quickly do something that we really  don't enjoy and one thing that I don't  find myself very good at is writing book  descriptions so here's what we're going  to do we're going to write a book  description for one of the books that it  suggested all right we're gonna use this  one right here we're gonna use the Eco  Warrior okay I said create a book  description for a children's picture  book called and I just put in the name  and then which is and then I just copy  and pasted that now of course if this is  your own book and and it's not one that  it suggested it's a book that you  created just give a little bit of story  like what's it what's it about and let's  see what it generates  okay and there you go it's written a  fairly lengthy three paragraph book  description that I can put on Amazon now  again if it's for your book you want to  make sure that you that you read it and  and it doesn't make sense is is it  actually relevant to your story because  obviously unless you put in a lot of  details about your story it may not it  might assume certain things so you want  to make sure that again you put in as  much as you can as much as the story is  about so it'll actually spit out things  that are true now if there are things in  here that aren't accurate to your book  take it out change some of the wording  whatever another thing that this is  really good for is and I know a lot of  my viewers are outside the U.S if  English is not your first language this  is a great way to get really good book  descriptions written where English is  clear you know I've read a lot of really  good books but the book descriptions  it's clear that it's written by someone  who English is their second language and  either they didn't have somebody edit it  or someone didn't edit the book  description well either way but if your  audience is in America or the UK or any  other English-speaking country then you  want to make sure that the English  that's in your book description is spot  on because if someone is going to  purchase your book and they see your  book description and your book  description is off grammatically then  it's going to be a huge deterrent and  they're probably just going to keep on  looking for the book somewhere else now  do I suggest using artificial  intelligence to create a book in from  start to finish no but you can have it  create a story for you I just put create  a picture book story about a turtle  named Ted that gets lost on his way home  from school and how he finds his way  back home  and as you can see this is not going to  be a lengthy story and I am in no way  shape or form suggesting that you do  this and then and then print it no I'm  suggesting you do this to give you ideas  again artificial intelligence is going  to come up with a way that you might not  have thought of of telling a story and  so you can use it to trigger ideas think  outside the box and find new ways to put  a Twist on the story that maybe you're  you're in the middle of you know writing  and and you just get writer's block or  whatever this is a great way to to just  trigger different ideas in your mind so  again I am in no way shape or form  suggesting that you tell artificial  intelligence to write a certain story  and then you just publish it no that is  no that's that's not a good idea that's  that's basically stealing and it's going  to give you it's going to give you  garbage I mean if you read this first of  all this is a very short  children's book story but also it's got  good ideas in it so again I don't  suggest you writing what it says here  word for word I'm not even suggesting  that you change a couple words I'm  suggesting you you tell it you know if  you're stuck and you want an idea  something to again think outside the box  one of the things that I like to do if I  get writer's block is is I like to to  read other children's books and and see  how people are doing that and and so I  can get inspiration that's the word I'm  looking for inspiration you can use this  to inspire you you know to to make you  think of other ways to approach the the  book you're writing so again I am not in  any way shape or form saying that you  should take this and publish it but use  it as inspiration just like you would  use uh you know another book off the  shelf as inspiration you know you might  buy go out and buy three or four books  and yeah still do that you know because  again it's it's giving other  perspectives but this is just another  way of just getting more ideas from you  know the ether and having it brought  into you again in the limited time that  we have so that's chat GPT artificial  intelligence let's go back to the studio  and see what I thought so what did you  think about chat GPT when it comes to  helping us write and create children's  picture books I'd love to know down in  the comments whether it's positive or  negative let me know now the question of  the day is is is does chat GPT or other  artificial intelligence does it hinder  creativity and authenticity is it the  end of it and I actually think it's the  exact opposite we as human beings have  only a finite amount of time in our day  and it's not realistic for us to think  that we can research all the different  possibilities in our Niche and outside  of our Niche but using this artificial  intelligence we can actually use it to  help us learn more and think outside the  box which I talk about all the time on  this channel think outside the box and  learn new ways to approach May maybe a  topic that we've already done before now  fun fact about chat GPT and artificial  intelligence in general I actually used  it to create not only the title for this  exact YouTube channel but the video  description down below so take a look  let me know what you think in the  comments about that as well don't forget  to subscribe to the channel and click  that Bell notification so you get  alerted every time I put out new videos  just like this one and hey give that  thumbs up a smashy smashy gives me that  nice warm fuzzy feeling and it lets  YouTube know to spread this video around  now don't let the learning stop here  speaking of YouTube that artificial  intelligence says that this video right  here is perfect for you now I don't know  I like this video right here it's one of  my favorites I'm not artificial and many  times I'm not even intelligent so you  pick which one you want to watch and  I'll catch you on the inside and  remember to write right
