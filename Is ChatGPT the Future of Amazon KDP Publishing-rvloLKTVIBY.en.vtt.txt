 we're talking today again about chat TPT  it's a hot Trend as always and how it's  going to enable you to publish more  books and to have a more successful  publishing business because you can take  advantage of this great tool to put  books out much quicker and at a much  higher standard but it comes with a  caveat and that is what I'm going to  discuss in this video some of the ways  that I use it and some of the ways that  you should not abuse it I highly  recommend that if you're not doing it  now that you start using chat GPT to  write book outlines  before writing book outlines would take  so long you would have to trawl through  all the five-star 4 star 3 star 2 Star  one star reviews of books to gain  insights about your customers to find  out what their pain points are to find  out what the things that they liked  about the books were you'd have to mine  the books for the content to understand  the niche better and to really get a  full picture of what you're going into I  would even go as far as looking at  YouTube Google and udemy for ideas and  titles and content and that could take  me up to three hours now all I can do is  just go on to chat GPT and say write me  an outline for a book about ketogenic  diet or give me some ideas for chapters  about ketogenic diet  and within a few minutes it's going to  produce all of that into a neatly and  concise written outline and from what  I've seen so far the quality is just as  good and and understands that Niche just  as well as doing it the hard way before  why waste that time and why waste that  brain power on something that you can  just give over to artificial  intelligence because it's some partner  business that you should not be too  heavily involved in if you were doing  that before then you should step away  from that and give it to a virtual  assistant or now to an artificial  assistant and they can write that much  quicker for you and then you can send it  to a real writer now moving on to  writing a lot of people are saying you  can write books with chat GPT I'm sure  you can but I wouldn't recommend it  the reasons why I say that is because if  you haven't noticed when you put stuff  into chat gbt it seems to produce  similar results and I'm pretty sure that  big companies like Amazon and all the  other publishing platforms are well  aware of this and they will be able to  detect it and I've heard of people  getting suspended and terminated their  accounts because of these reasons now do  so at your own risks you might be able  to get away with it but if you're a more  established publisher then I would be  less likely to take that risk I know  people will say yeah you can run it  through chat gbt and then through a  rewriter but are you really producing  valuable content then is it going to get  good reviews is it going to have a good  flow of voice is it going to have a good  tone and is it going to be something  that offers value to the customer and  are you really going to understand that  Niche if you look to have longevity in  it rather than just some short-term pump  and done strategy sure try that if  that's what you want but you know you're  just not going to get very far and very  deep with that I think ultimately to to  make good money from publishing you're  always going to have to build a brand  and that's going to allow you to  leverage other ways to monetize your  income on publishing through monetizing  your lists and other channels related to  the publishing maybe it's video content  maybe it's courses maybe it's coaching  and so on if you're just using  artificial intelligence to make that  content and it's going to be very  difficult to link that value to a human  and to and to explore at a potential  revenue streams that's where the cap is  and maybe chat GPT would have been  amazing six years ago when people were  much more pump and dumped with Kindle  publishing but right now it's more  focused on Brands and I don't think that  you know you will get very far trying to  write books with it maybe things will  change in the in a few years I'm sure  they will I'm sure chat gbt will get  much more advanced and we as Publishers  and entrepreneurs we need to keep an eye  on all of that and to move with the  trends and to make the most of this  technology you know so as I said the  outlines it can be great for it can be  great for writing descriptions for your  book for the blurb that you put on  Amazon you can just get it to spin off  multiple versions of book descriptions  for your books and then you can tweak  and mesh those together as you wish and  then you can use it for your email  campaigns you can use it for creating  titles for your book and for just  keyword ideas as well it's a incredibly  powerful tool for that and should make  the most of it but remember don't abuse  it and don't try to take shortcuts we  should always be trying to add value to  our customers and the way we add value  to our customers is by understanding  them and in order to understand that  customers we need to understand the  content that we that we produce I'm not  saying that you need to be an expert but  if you're just putting a few sentences  into something and then spewing out  content and hoping to be able to relate  to your customers and build a solid  brand around that I don't think it's  going to be a successful Endeavor I'm  open to you proving me wrong  if someone gets out there and starts  crushing it with chat GPT and you know  building a sustainable brand around that  empowered to them but just be aware that  it comes with risks Amazon is aware of  chat GPT as are all of the large  publishing platforms and you should do  so at your own risks and make sure that  you're always focused on reducing the  best quality content just a small thing  to add on that as well is there's a lot  of development recently even Google have  launched their own artificial  intelligence program called bad and  that's going to be a groundbreaking  thing because if you know Google they're  huge right and Microsoft have also got  the chat gbt combined with their search  engine as well so keep your eyes peeled  things are going to be exciting for the  future don't be afraid of this  technology embrace it learn about it and  utilize it
