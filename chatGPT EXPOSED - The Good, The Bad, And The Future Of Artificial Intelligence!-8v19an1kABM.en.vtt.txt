 hello everybody Welcome to the channel I  found this awesome article talking about  chat GPT and how it's basically causing  a lot of problems in our community I  made this channel recently to talk all  about Ai and its effects on our  community it is going to be crazy if  you're watching this video right now and  telling you in about a year from now  things are going to be very very  different the card is out of the box  it's crazy okay and I had no idea it was  this powerful to be honest now I'm  almost passing you know companies have  been using this for a while so it's just  new to us like we're finally getting to  play with it and it's insane the no chat  GPT look at this Valley the 29 billion  dollars Microsoft has exposure let's  read a little bit on this it says chat  GPT is a topic that got everyone talking  these days and AI chat bot so I'm gonna  go over this chatbot and show you how  it's done if you don't already know but  basically it's saying that it has led to  worry about certain professions becoming  obsolete I would say more than just  certain professions I mean just this  chat GPT yes it's definitely gonna take  a lot of people out of work but it's the  AI as a whole how people are you know  chat GPT it's just a chat box that you  ask it to do to write you things but  people are using this AI to basically  solve real problems like do you know to  make planes faster to make you stronger  do you know how do you basically how do  you disperse a budget you know and What  needs to get prioritized AI is now going  to infiltrate every part of our society  and basically you're not going to have a  room full of people thinking about stuff  you know and what's the best now what we  have is basically computer is going to  speed out the best possible outcome so  we don't need a room full of Engineers  trying to figure out you know how to  make a car safer or faster or whatever a  computer is going to do it in seconds  that computer can just go right into it  and print into whatever it is that you  want to do like 3D printed and it's done  so as far as like humans you know like  think about healthcare for example think  about you know going going to see a  doctor you go to see a doctor right now  you're basically asking the doctor to  think of all this knowledge about what  could be wrong with you and then the  doctor kind of figures out well it could  be this it could be that let's dream  this let's see what happens we'll  imagine you walk in and see an AI doctor  you tell the doctor your symptoms and  the AI doctor could probably come out  with a better plan than just a regular  human doctor I mean there's stories  where these AI robots are passing in no  medical exams but they're more efficient  and faster than humans and this stuff is  now accelerating very very rapidly so  check this out on Microsoft invested 1  billion to open AI back in 2019 and was  able to find concrete information under  the implied valuation of Microsoft deal  but it was two years before the 14  billion dollar deal it looks like  Microsoft is sitting on a significance  of paper games additionally Microsoft  was able to pay for the deal with the  combination of a short credits in cash  so basically there's some people are  going to make a lot of money this would  be a good time to get into Microsoft but  it's not Financial advice but you know  what this is just insane what it could  do so a lot of people are hearing this  they're reading these articles even  though they're thinking Okay blah blah  blah what does this mean right well what  is Chuck GPT right what is it at the end  of the day so for those who don't know  if all you have to do is Google Chat GPT  go to the first link it's called  openline.com GPT you click on that you  make an account and once you make an  account you're going to be sent to this  chat GPT right and then you say okay  what is it it's basically this chat box  you could ask it to write you anything  you could ask it to write your code to  make a website you could ask it to make  you know mathematical equations that  solve problems you could ask it to write  you an episode of Friends you know on TV  you could ask it to write you literally  a new story you basically put in a few  little things and I don't exactly know  how it works but it's amazing it's  literally amazing check this out I want  to start pretty simple I asked chat GPT  write me a business model for you too  very very simple okay like I said this  thing is very very powerful but I want  to just start off simple to show you  what it does look at this it creates it  writes everything for you so when you  think about like your average corporate  office right you're going to have all  these sorts of employees there's usually  an employee in charge of writing stuff  right the copywriter or you know the  marketing manager will right now I just  wrote it in seconds I just typed into a  chat box drag me a business model for  YouTuber influencer and it's done I  could literally say you know look at  this I wrote write me a 30 second  commercial for Coca-Cola soft drinks and  there you go it's you know it's  guaranteed if I was to read this it  would come out to exactly 30 seconds  what does it say it says thirsty for  something delicious deliciously  refreshing look no further than  Coca-Cola are plastic carbonated soft  drink will satisfy your Cravings blah  blah blah blah if you understand what  this just did you know you could imagine  you have a room full we know creative  people trying to come up with something  that this chat GPT basically just came  up with in seconds so you could see how  is that going to influence our future  business meetings when they're sitting  there saying you know I have an idea  well who cares let's just type in your  idea and chat GPT and see what it comes  out with and then you know I could  definitely see this is going to destroy  a lot of people's jobs and basically  anybody writes writer is this is not  looking it's not looking good for them  furthermore school right University the  idea that the students can just go in  here and type in you know write me an  essay about whatever add sources and it  automatically does it like I said this  writes anything you could write write me  code me a landing page with photos and  whatever and it's going to give you the  code that literally the HTML code that  you could copy and paste into your  website this thing is incredibly  powerful it writes codes it could write  functions it could write you like I said  essays or whatever you could say right  write me a resume write me a cover  letter unfortunately yeah it's going to  write you a cover letter but there's not  going to be any jobs available so this  is very very scary stuff and this AI is  not just this chat box it's everywhere  school has to change because anybody  could cheat now cheating is basic and if  you look just type in chat GPT and  education news you could see some some  colleges are trying to fight back but I  don't think you could fight back it's  the cut is out of the bag everybody for  traditional schooling in many ways  because like I said you could just write  it here type me an essay or write me  whatever you could ask this thing to  write your rest the best grilled cheese  recipe it will write you whatever you  want it is so insane and then you could  tweak it right you could do different  things so again chat GPT is here it is  you know pretty scary but it's also  pretty awesome what is the world going  to look like in a year from now and  telling you things are going to be  different a lot of people are going to  get laid off we're just going to hop too  we're going to have to evolve a lot  faster to keep up with these computers  or else we're done the computers are  just going to take off and do their own  thing without us who knows how that's  going to look like but we're definitely  no longer the top dog in this world AI  is here and it is smarter than us and it  is quicker than us so we really really  hope to see what's gonna happen here but  I feel like we should be excited but  definitely very worrying pieces this is  something that we've been talking about  for years and years and years and it's  finally here for the average person and  it is just mind-boggling
