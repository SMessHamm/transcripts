 hello all my name is krishnaik and  welcome to my YouTube channel so guys uh  chargpt yes the Talk of the Town right  now obviously charging is performing  well you're able to get the solutions  quickly uh even for some of my office  work and for for some of my video ideas  I use chat GPT for quick Solutions I  definitely go to charge a bit and ask  the questions right  but the question still comes in our mind  will charge up to create our creativity  skill  and to tell you the answer directly guys  it may kill the creativity skills for  the future generation and for the  current generation also  there was a time you know we used to  learn each and everything from scratch  we used to probably learn those things  we used to practice those things and  then probably go ahead and do Google  Search and come up with more amazing  things right now with the help of charge  Deputy obviously uh it is a boon to the  developers because you get the solution  quickly but understand this generation  developers like we have like people who  are having uh five years experience or  two years experience three years  experience they have learned something  from scratch and then they probably ask  for different kind of solutions with  respect to their work right with respect  to learning anything and charge if it is  directly able to give the answer  for us it is definitely good because it  is helping us to do our work very  quickly but when we think about the  future generation you know when they  learn everything from scratch you know  at that point of time if they just  understand that okay charge up it is  there to help us out they can probably  do the entire assignments College  assignments schools assignment directly  from chargeability they may get the  answer and they may just directly but  not only that guys even writing a leave  letter you know they will not think of  their mind like what they have to  specifically write and they may directly  go ahead ask chargpt and chargeability  will be there to give you the entire  Solution by this way I feel your  creativity skill are going off even  content writers right there are so many  content writers who write different  different blogs who write different  different things right who write  articles they also will probably take  the hap help of charge APD because  charge Deputy will be able to provide  you the solution very much quickly now  this is a bigger bigger blunder that is  that may happen guys so uh my suggestion  to you all will be that always make sure  that you try to learn something from  scratch practice as well unless and  until you don't practice it you know  even though you know that you may  probably get a solution from charging  Beauty but practice well when you are a  learner whether you're learning any  technology whether you're going to write  any content whether you're going to  write any blogs regarding any any  subject as such right first of all you  give your best efforts and then probably  try to make it better right even  translator work has also been taking  handled by the entire chart GPT right  there's so many things obviously there  are so many jobs that chair GPT can  definitely hamper but the most most  disadvantaged thing that I feel is that  it will  kill your creativity skills right that  is the thing  now there are many people who may be  thinking that okay charge Deputy may  take out our jobs also it may happen  this yeah it may happen in the future  currently what I feel it is helping the  developers to do their work quickly yes  at one point of time we don't know what  may happen because now Google is also  probably coming up with its own chat bot  you know which will be able to answers  like this and they're still in the  Improvement stage right and charge a bit  I don't know like  the next version may be a supermodel  right super NLP model you know which can  do many more tasks compared to now  so creativity is the thing that you  cannot probably gain from any tools as  such creativity is a thing that you can  probably gain from your learnings from  your process from your hard work from  your practices from your own research  when you start working in that specific  way your creative security skills comes  right so this is the thing that I  probably want to talk about  chargeability and creativity  please be cautious right with respect to  using charge GPT  uh if you want to start my only  suggestion will be that if you want to  start learning anything learn it from  scratch  practice it right it may be let's say  consider data science right you may get  all the solutions you may get code right  you may get steps but before that learn  it from yourself right try to practice  that  try to see what kind of Errors you are  getting instead of directly asking the  errors to the charge repeat  this way you will get to know the entire  process once you probably get to know  this process for multiple projects let's  say then you will get to know like how  you can probably solve the issue right  because understand if I say that I'm 10  plus years of experience right this  experience is with respect to the work  that I have done right yes I may have  done Google search during that time to  find out issues to fix the issues  through the community and many more  things but now chargeable is so Advanced  that whatever question you specifically  ask you may get the answer right so  always try to use this cautiously don't  kill your creativity skill don't clear  your experience unless and until you  work on something you get you solve that  particular issue then you get to know  about that issue and because of that  issue there may be other issues that may  be happening you will get to know about  that also right but the the thing that I  feel is that yes for the future  generation  because in schools and colleges right  all the assignments everything was done  by me right and because of that I was  able to become knowledgeable right I was  able to have some creativity with  respect to the subject that I'm studying  but now the situation is completely  different everybody wants to do their  work quickly so they will directly help  take the help of chargeability right so  they should not happen guys so please  make be cautious regarding this uh try  to learn anything from scratch yes when  you want to done your work done quicker  right then definitely take the help of  chargeability in companies and all if  you're working  uh but uh don't make this as a habit to  learn everything from chat gbt no you  will directly get the solution but  you'll not get that in-depth knowledge  that in-depth knowledge is required  unless you don't get that in-depth  knowledge you will not be called as an  experienced person in this generation  someone says probably in in the upcoming  20 30 years someone says me I'm 10 years  of experience I will know that what kind  of experience he or she will have  probably taken the help of charge deputy  and all but right now for the people who  currently like have passed out of the  college they are still in first year  second year they're working or let's say  they're working in some companies some  startups right for them chargability  will be helpful for the learning purpose  for finding out the solution quickly  for my generation specifically I've seen  everything like from 2000 2005 till 2020  I've seen everything I've seen the  generation changing from mobile phones  to laptops to desktops and now chat GPT  obviously so many AI Solutions also have  seen so I have actually done that kind  of hard work I have seen each and every  phase I've learned through things I've  fixed through things I have solved  complex problems and that is the reason  I you see in most of my videos I talk  about my experience like what how did I  solve this particular problem or if you  probably see any of my machine learning  videos that I first of all talked  in-depth Mac mathematical intuition and  then probably go towards the  implementation side right so it is good  to learn in this way instead of skipping  that part which is the most hardest part  right the learning from scratch is  always a very hardest part right and  probably once you learn from that and  once you're solving problems right you  will be able to solve multiple problems  in an easier way right yes through some  research obviously you'll probably do  Google research and many more things but  now I see most of the people directly  asking the solution to charge ABT  without even trying right so this is a  suggestion that I would like to give  everyone please make your learning  completely from scratch  there is chargeable to give you the  entire Solutions don't go through that  even coding practice problems also right  do it from scratch understand build that  logic building that is required once you  are able to do that then probably charge  up it is the best friend of yours  but I still think what will happen to  the future generation you know so yes  let me know about your thoughts in the  comment section of this particular video  I hope you like this particular video uh  please make sure you share this video  with everyone I really want to know many  people comments on this particular topic  will it create will it kill your  creativity or not right and I feel yes  because now person who is even in the  Masters of PhD for writing the thesis  paper right they they will be taking the  help of chargeability before it was more  about experimentation it was more about  doing multiple things now even word to  word if they really want to form a  sentence they will be thinking of  Charity so this way your creativity will  go right so let me know about your  thoughts in this particular video share  with this video with many people so that  we get to know more comments like what  they think about chargeability with  respect to creativity so yes this was it  for my side I'll see you all in the next  video thank you
