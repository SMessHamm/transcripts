 something I've been paying attention to  for a couple weeks now chat GPT ladies  and gentlemen it's only been out for a  couple weeks but those of you that have  been nerding out like myself and just  absolutely  mind-boggled by this uh advancement in  technology I felt like we had to talk  about it here on the good life because  it's going to make some people's lives  really really good really really good so  if you have not been uh in this world of  chat GPT I'll give you the other side  really quick before I dive in for those  of you that have been seeing these AI  visual pictures you see people posting  pictures of themselves but it's got all  this AI uh Cosmic art behind it and  everybody's just putting pictures of  themselves out there well that's the AI  side of art now imagine you take that  and you take the AI side of words and uh  uh coding and and articles and  everything that comes down to chatting  or right the word side of things not  just the picture side the word side  this is what chat GPT is if you have not  looked at it I highly recommend you look  at it this is going to change our lives  significantly we've all heard that AI  artificial intelligence is going to be  something that's going to continue to  progress our the uh our society we're  going to be able to have smarter uh  technology that helps us get to so to  speak third base in any type of  interaction you've seen this with bots  on uh social media your message uh an  account and it gives you automated  responses you go to your favorite  website you go to you know you get some  uh customer service on a website and  it's a bot that just continues to answer  your questions by you prompting it well  imagine that Google meets a virtual  assistant and they had a baby and they  gave you everything that you could ever  possibly want as far as information  that's what chat GPT is it is an amazing  uh platform amazing app where literally  you can go in and type in any query  anything that you have a question about  anything you want to make happen and and  it will spit out  the answer for you it'll actually  formulate and pull data from the  internet and from sources it can scan  right all over the internet all over the  web and pull uh resources to be able to  answer that question not just like  Google Google or any search engine Yahoo  Bing Ask Jeeves whatever it is  you type in  how do I  uh how do I sell products online  and it's what it's going to bring up a  bunch of websites it's going to bring up  30 50 100 websites you're going to click  the website then you got to scan the  information you got to see is this a  reputable site is this something I want  to learn is this something that is  actually uh factual and correct Maybe  not maybe I moved to the next site  that would be your action if you were on  Google or some type of search engine  but now we take it to chat gbt and jack  chat GPT what it does is you can type in  that same thing how do I sell products  online and it's going to give you not  only the website well it's not going to  give you the websites it's going to tell  you exactly what to do  it's not going to give you just the  places where you can go scan and find  out how to how to sell something online  it's actually going to tell you step by  step how to sell something online it's  going to synthesize all the information  that was there on the web and it's going  to put it right in a small paragraph in  a small bullet point uh uh sentences  that's going to give you the information  right away  that's a basic example you take it down  I've seen people do this over the past  two weeks since this app has been out  and people have said hey write me a code  write me a code for a video game that  does I don't know XYZ and guess what  chat GPT will do it'll write you a full  code  it'll literally write code for you you  can put that code in and you can  actually build that that game that  platform whatever it is that you wanted  if you dove into now the health and  wealth side of things I've seen some  people playing around with the algorithm  to say hey can you predict kind of  what's where I should buy a certain  stock or where I should buy a certain uh  um a certain  um  Bond or something along those lines  guess what it'll it'll give you all the  information you need to make an educated  decision on when you should buy at what  price point all those types of things  as far out as your mind can think ladies  and gentlemen this is what this  technology will do the most disruptive  piece of technology that has come out  probably in the past 15 to 20 years and  it's going to change our lives not to  mention copywriters people that write  blogs people that write copy for  internet for for social media posts all  of that stuff continuously you just type  in hey write me a Blog on the best way  to to budget your money and guess what  it's going to do it's gonna write an  entire blog post on the best ways to  budget you write out tell me create me a  meal plan create me a meal plan  that uh is good for a 35 year old woman  with high blood pressure  and guess what it's going to do it's  going to create a full meal plan for  that person  the things that this is going to be able  to do is going to be incredible it's  going to completely change our lives and  that's why I'm so excited about it not  to mention though  this is going to change this is going to  take jobs away from people this is going  to completely change our industry so for  those of us that are listening  you got to know that if this technology  already exists and now they're getting  it to the public what does that mean for  your job what does that mean for the  sector that you're in what does that  mean for the uh the the interaction you  have  with your client base or with your  customers how could this technology be  used to replace some of those things  replace some of those employees it's  going to happen  we can see it happen on the wealth side  of things where people's jobs are going  to be taken away and now you're going to  have to find ways to create other  streams of income for yourself for those  of you that are ahead of the game if you  play around with this technology you can  start businesses that are simple that  can go out there and use this technology  and help more people  from a health perspective  if you needed things like meal plans  things like uh under understanding how  to  um uh pay attention to certain aspects  of your health it might be right there  in this app  I'm excited about it I believe it's  something that's going to change our  lives drastically and I can't wait till  uh this thing really really gets to  scale so we can see how this will affect  our lives  that's all I got to say about that I'm  fired up about it  let's go ladies and gentlemen I was 10  by 10 because my man over here is so  excited about chat g d something  something  okay put
