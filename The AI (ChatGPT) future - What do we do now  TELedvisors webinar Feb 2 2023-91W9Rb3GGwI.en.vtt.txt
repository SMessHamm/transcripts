 foreign  welcome everybody to the February  televisors webinar first for 2023 we  have a super hot topic to talk about  today the AI chat GPT future where are  we and what are we going to do now I'd  like to begin by acknowledging that I'm  coming to you from the lands of the  warangiri people of the coolant Nations  and I pay my respects to Elders past and  present  um those people who aren't familiar with  the televisors network we are a special  interest group  um we're part of escalite the  australasian society the computers in  learning in tertiary education and we  act as a community of practice senior  practitioners for people working in the  education third space so learning  designers education technologists  academic developers all those kinds of  people  in terms of the session today obviously  we've got this wonderful panel before us  um  how we're going to run is we've come up  with  um up a dozen also questions that we're  kind of going to work through uh please  do put your questions into the Q a we're  not running the chart because there's a  lot of people and after a certain point  chat just becomes impossible to follow  so please do have your conversations  there if you do if you are in the back  channel on Twitter because I know I do  that all the time please use the  hashtags televisors or hashtag AI Ed  um  I think that's about it so I'm now going  to hand over to associate professor Tim  reforms who is my colleague at mono she  works in the Monash education Academy  and he will be your host for this  session  thanks very much Colin it's an absolute  thrill to be part of this chat with such  an amazing panel of  um speakers with various different hats  on I think today  um and equally terrifying to be part of  this chat in front of so many people I  think the latest numbers are about 2.4  billion  um  although some of those might be Bots  um so my job today I'll introduce the  panel uh but my job today is to try and  keep them under control so good luck um  to me with that the  the speakers I'm gonna have  um the chat running for you but not the  the participants in the hope that I can  say George please stop talking  um and if that doesn't work then I'll  wave frantically at you and in really  subtle style and if that doesn't work  I'll just try and find the mute button  um so without further Ado I will  introduce the panel then we'll have a  few kind of established questions and uh  then we'll leave a bit of time for  questions from the audience so please do  use that q a function although some of  the panelists might if they get bored  with what one of the other panelists are  saying  um answer some of those questions uh  through typing  so you've already heard from Colin um  Colin is an educational technologist at  Monash University in Melbourne in the  teaching and learning portfolio he's a  leader of ascolite televisors network  which you have just heard about he's  also an ad Tech columnist for the campus  morning mail which is worth a read we  have Anna Mills a teacher of writing at  the College of Marin in San Francisco  that's right isn't it Hannah  um and we are calling you you might not  call yourself this but we're calling you  an AI in education thought leader and as  George said you have started preparing a  whole lot of fabulous resources that  everyone should check out really really  helpful thank you for your work in that  sector we have Professor George Siemens  at the University of South Australia  Adelaide and George is very well known  for his research into human and  artificial cognition the impact of  Advanced Technologies like Artificial  Intelligence on University Systems  um really looking forward just hearing  your perspective on all of this stuff  we have Anisha bakaria senior manager of  learning analytics at The Institute for  teaching and learning Innovation at  University of Queensland Brisbane and I  believe your PhD was in a really  relevant field so you've thought a lot  about this for a lot longer than some of  us  um Trish McCloskey associate professor  and director of digital learning and at  deakin University in Melbourne so  overseeing some fantastic people as well  as processes and systems  um so I'm just going to throw this over  I think we maybe start with Anna  and then I will let others come in as  they see fit or if that's not happening  I'll prompt you via the chat  um so the more immediate and practical  stuff to start with I think what kinds  of things do you think that Educators  can do right now to strengthen their or  their assessments or feel better about  the Integrity of their Assessments in  the short term  hmm  well I think  um my Approach is that there's not one  practice that's going to sort of address  everything but we can look at a range of  options  um the first thing I think is sort of  obvious but to focus on intrinsic  motivation and engagement and clarifying  why we're assigning writing and what  students will get out of the process of  writing itself that writing is a tool  for thinking  um so you know kind of foregrounding  that even more than we already do  um establishing policies at the class  level  um maybe asking students to affirm that  their work is their own  um establishing a norm of transparency  around what is AI text and what is human  um I think is going to be really  important and we might want to at this  point mention that  um  AI identification software exists and is  evolving  um that's a big conversation that's  controversial but um perhaps students  should know that that is  um a possibility and that um you know we  shouldn't go into this imagining that we  can use an AI text generator and keep  that private forever in every situation  and and claim that we put those words  together  um so if we can just sort of  part of the norm around these tools  um  and you know we can experiment with our  own prompts and see if we can adapt them  so that chat GPT is not very good at  them that is tricky  um there are some ways to make it harder  to use chat GPT to do a passable job on  a writing assignment maybe analyzing  multimedia analyzing longer texts  referring to class discussion or  um  peer collaborative annotations  um  nothing is a is  foolproof  um but we can also look to some sort of  tried and true  um writing pedagogy strategies for  assigning steps in the writing process  um conferences with students allowing  some time for in-class writing that  students can then build on  um so all of those things can help make  it more attractive to for students to to  do their own work and to disclose if and  when they are using some kind of AI  assistance  um so maybe I'll I'll stop there well  that's correct that's a lot of territory  and I guess you're talking about uh a  balance or a or a multiple approach of  thinking about ways to make it more  assessments more secure and thinking  about ways of motivating students to do  things and designing things that they  work differently does anyone want to  wade into the controversy let's we may  as well start there wade into the  controversy around detection and  technological kind of approaches to  dealing with academic integrity  yeah oh so I I think one of the the main  things is just the  way that these tools are going to be  embedded in just normal things so you  know Microsoft's come on board and have  jumped on board really early so we'll  probably have Microsoft integrating with  these Technologies tools like notion and  canva already have Integrations in beta  I think sometimes students won't even  know that they're using it  um the trouble with the detection is  that we're always going to be playing  catch up so I think you know open AI  introduced a new little classifier tool  yesterday and I've been playing with gbt  zero it it's there's large false  positives basically the more you prompt  and the more you direct the output uh  the less accurate it's going to be When  people's own ideas get get into it and  um The Moment I Saw I think the first  tweet I saw about the detection software  from  open AI itself uh what I basically found  about it was  um straight after that there's a tweet  with someone using something called gbt  0 or gbt minus one which was actually  paraphrasing so you could take your AI  generated text it's classified as a  generator text and  um essentially it found synonyms  paraphrased it and then the detection  software failed I do think there's a lot  of work still happening in this space to  try and make it that way  I think you know with the amount of  startups in the space and paid services  that are coming from open AI exposing  this as an API it's going to be really  hard hard to police and I think this is  where  um you know I think it's really  it's not so much rethinking assessment  but you know I think  it's perhaps a bit quite controversially  embracing some of these new technologies  and so I actually feel much more  optimistic about chat GPT in education  versus the predecessor just tbd3 and I  think the game changer for me really was  that it was able to take feedback rather  than just you give it generate this and  it gave it back to you it could take  feedback you could evolve it you could  direct it in my experience with it uh  there's a lot more evaluative judgment  and critical thinking and so I think as  educators  the move forward would be not to just  accept the First on odd to to build  student competencies to not just accept  the first output that these systems give  us I mean and it's using it as a  starting point and then using all our  human skills and our human knowledge and  creativity to actually rapidly iterate  and direct the output into what we would  like to evolve it into  um and  at that point I think this is where  perhaps assessment artifacts could  actually be looking at things like the  actual prompt history to see how you as  a human directed the output in and  changed it and delivered something of  much higher quality uh and you know when  thinking of that those are higher level  skills and at some point it's  self-sufficiency self-reliance and and  base competencies that also need to be  developed and I'd love to see more  discussion with curriculum about what's  the right point to introduce these after  these base competencies are established  um essentially and perhaps even it's us  moving rubrics further along and so what  was you know what was a credit  no longer is a credit and what used to  be a distinction is now a credit  opening up loads of territory sorry  Colin lots of lots of lots of ground  covered in that and and I I agree I  think that particularly the detection  side of things  um it's going to be an arms race  um  I don't know if that's necessarily going  to solve the issues and I actually come  back to a lot of what Anna had to say in  terms of  the way that we design learning and  teaching activities and not not just  assessments but just the way we actually  use this in learning and teaching is  going to be much more significant and  yeah I think all the things you know  like obviously we consider the  limitations of the talk right now the  fact that some of the data sets are a  little bit older so if you're talking  about current news stories it's all it's  a little bit harder for the um  for the technology to kind of you know  fake it uh getting people looking at  images and analyzing and just evaluating  and you know sort of the higher order  stuff in Bloom's taxonomy essentially  um I think that there's a I don't know I  feel like there is still a lot that can  be done  in the way that we teach  um  and I mean there's two sides to this  question as well but but maybe other  people on the panel did want to talk  about  um talk about the educational approaches  that we might take  um yeah it was just out of the dressing  do you speak Anisha I was reminded of  Maslow's  um law of the instrument you know which  says that if the only tool you have is a  hammer everything looks like a nail and  if we position our students as you know  in the negative of being cheaters rather  than eager curious Learners then we tend  to look for that and I know that in all  of our conversations around um chat GPT  it has become in some camps cheap GPT  you know that's the focus rather than  looking at what the options are the  opportunities are for us to actually use  it for good  so  um turning that slightly towards  concerns around students rather than you  know the issue of worrying about the  students Integrity Anna um if you could  you contribute to the discussion around  the privacy concerns especially to do  with detection of of artificial  intelligence  yeah I think  it's an important concern that um  someone raised in the Q a too that um we  really shouldn't just be copying and  pasting our students writing into a  third-party tool when we don't know what  they'll do with that data  um and we don't we haven't established  through the institution some kind of  um contract with permissions negotiated  there around the data so I think that's  an important point that I learned from  Mark Watkins  um of University of Mississippi  um I would hesitate I would say you know  if we're going to use detectors we  really would have to ask for the  student's permission  um my vision of the detectors also is a  little bit  um  that that it could help facilitate  um  use and education about  um these tools because it helps us to  continue to distinguish between what's  what's human and what's Ai and continue  to reflect on what are we getting from  the AI where is that coming from  um as kind of as Anisha mentioned we  might want to watch the the transcript  of a chat session where it's clearly  labeled what the student says and what  chat GPT says  um we might want to use the identifiers  to help us keep those distinct in when  students turn in their writing  um  but I do think that the the data privacy  needs to be resolved before we try to  use any kind of detection tool at scale  and we also need to recognize that these  tools are currently not at all reliable  they have a lot of false positives and  false negatives and  there are so many ways to evade them it  will be an arms race so maybe if we're  going to use them we could develop a way  to use them that's more collaborative  with students rather than you know we're  threatening you with expulsion  um that it could be more of  um  one one opening for discussion with the  student that's not  um not about questioning their integrity  um  that's what I'm interested in developing  thank you so um owner here from George  in a second but before we do  um maybe this was a good one for you  Trish  thinking about all the things that we've  talked about so far what do you think  are the the key considerations from an  Institutional response point of view not  speaking for Deacon um but just roaring  it out um if you are an institution what  are the main factors you're thinking  about when you're coming up with a  response to this situation  had new technology and I've been around  the sector for a long time we get  warning off it we buy it we have  contracts we you know um plan for its  low light we get the the  um information for staff we run  workshops then we soft launch it and  then we hold people's hands this has  just arrived and none of us know how to  navigate it because it's not as stable  as it's been in the past and I'm getting  continuous responses for from the staff  to can we have a workshop well it's  changing all the time so you might run a  workshop on something and says you know  use only information pre-2021 well it  could be that next week it's updated  with everything there's post 2021 so  it's a continuously shifting space at  Deacon what we've done I'm sorry to  speak about Deacon is that we've taken a  4A approach so we're actually talking  about raising students awareness and  staff awareness of it  um getting people to acknowledge that  they've actually used it so putting it  into either citations or something that  identifies that it has been used to  support the submission of an assessment  and looking at our assessments are they  fit for purpose could they be done by a  bot and also looking at authenticity  that can be mapped across a whole  program  so we're trying to take a four-pronged  approach to it with staff and students  this is not just about getting staff up  to speed or making sure that students  are not using it it's and I think that  we can co-create that with our students  they've been using it for years  various iterations  thank you so given this shifting  landscape and the way everything changes  I might come to you George for this one  if it's okay  um what do you think the role of  research is here and are the researchers  and the experts being listened to and I  suppose relatedly who are the experts in  this territory  but important questions and and I I  think some there's a component here  that's interesting so just by way a  little bit of background and you know  obviously we've we've heard so much  development about AI for a long time but  all of it was disconnected right it was  it's almost like it escaped the lab in  the form of chat GPT we were reading  articles about Blake Lemoine and Lambda  with the Google platform and we were  reading articles about uh you know  whatever platform beats uh whatever lead  expert it'll go or chess or pick  something and even strategy games and so  I think part of the hype that we're  experiencing right now which feels like  it's Web 2.0 blended with moocs and then  Amplified is what it sounds like because  yeah chess can't get away from it but uh  so the um there's an important  conversation happening here which is a  sense making conversation and a sense  making conversation is when we're  whacking our way through a jungle and  trying to say like what the hell is this  thing like is this important what does  it mean here what does it mean there  there's what's the what are the uh  implications and how I teach next week  how's this reflected in my classroom  what should I do you know and we're all  in the middle of that right now in these  kinds of events are part of it I think  this there's at least I'm aware of about  another five or six panels or webinars  of this sort that are going on within  the next two weeks and through Grail  we're hosting several of those ourselves  um but what I think is important now is  exactly this it's a sense making  conversation you're trying to orient  what this is potentially and what it  means and that's why we're getting all  of the usual oh you know it's this in  this kind of a context or it's you know  it is the I don't know the Napster of  something I'm just uh you know waiting  for those kinds of conversations to  arise but that's what we're trying to do  we know it's different and I think one  of the challenges is we start to use it  in a way that wants to put it in a very  natural kind of a psychology of learning  lens into a category that allows us to  stabilize this and apprehend it in a way  that we feel okay with what it is so I  want to honor the importance of the  practical side of it and the  conversations that you know Colin raised  about the design aspect and the learning  implications and you know what what  others have shared you know Trish about  the experience of students or I know  you're talking about the the use of  plagiarism detection software and the  list goes on these are all critical  components  the research lens to finally get  to your question I think is one of those  slow Burns right when your house is on  fire you're not looking for your life  insurance or for your house insurance  policy you're trying to get everybody  out and then you're going to sit down  and look at okay what are we up against  I've already started to see at least two  or three academic articles peer-reviewed  that made through some kind of a process  with a chat GPT Focus but it's worth  emphasizing Chad GPT is just a small  part of a much broader Suite of tools  that have been adopted for an extended  period of time you know we've run uh I  guess coming up this year our fourth uh  conference in uh you know empowering  learners for the age of AI which we've  covered everything from could be  robotics it could be in this case  automation tools Predictive Analytics  tools chat GPT gives us a brief sensory  experience with a really complex piece  of technology you know the large  language model that we're interacting  with sometimes it's ridiculous but it's  vain enough for us to keep listening to  it's kind of like you know you go to a  pub and you meet somebody and they're  talking nonsense but sometimes they're  saying something really interesting so  you're not quite sure is this going to  be a fun conversation are we going to go  off the deep end at any point and that's  the chat GPT conversation and research I  think is the group that has to unpack  that there are as I'm aware of now four  NSF funded research programs out of the  U.S looking at Ai and Robotics one that  was just announced that looked at uh you  know sort of language and disability  Focus that was announced I think  yesterday there's adult learning and  that's run by James Lester out of North  Carolina and there's another sort of  lifelong learning angle that's run with  the Georgia Tech system out of Europe  was just received a 60 million euro  Grant around Ai and lifelong learning  and in Australia I know there have been  attempts to get a similar approach  research-wise so to your question the  final one is that the researchers you  should be listening to are really any of  those Center leads or any individuals  from My Lens I'm coming at a very  specific lens which is through the  learning analytics Legacy into this  space that's sort of the door to which I  arrived to this there's a lot of other  perspectives of Monash as well I know  Niels selwyn's doing quite a bit of  critical work I know University of  Edinburgh has applied a critical lens to  this conversation as well so I'm just  trying to emphasize I speak from a  perspective that I unabashedly believe  that AI is a critical part of the future  of Education I unabashedly believe that  there's fundamental systems change that  needs to happen in that conversation uh  and right now I'm at the Let It Burn  stage right like let's figure out what  this is rather than Force into an  existing perspective but the research  needs to become more Central to the  conversation because I'm hearing a lot  of people who never looked at AI  extensively don't have a research  framework to interact with AI that are  getting airtime on what it is and what  it isn't but there's individuals that  have been you know Google's team that  was disbanded that looked at algorithmic  bias uh you know any of the individuals  that left that team you know Melanie  Mitchell uh is fantastic researcher that  people should be tracking there's all  the traditional Hinton Lagoon uh Gary  Marcus uh bengio and others that people  should be tracking as well so there's a  range of researchers core researchers in  landscape to pay attention to but I  think right now is a moment of sense  making with the research team coming on  a little bit behind but all of that  still says it's this system's effect is  the part that really matters and how  that cashes out  fantastic there are a lot of thumbs up  to let it burn I don't know if that's  good or bad but  quite I suppose there are a lot of  potential thumbs so there are a lot of  people who didn't put their thumbs up to  that as well  um but thinking about okay this is going  to keep being a thing going forward  um the next question is going to be  around how do we get  um Everybody students teachers  educational stakeholders to build their  digital or AI literacy whatever that  means I don't know if we know what that  means yet and and also  um thinking about how that's connected  to other types of literacies to do with  the practice of education and assessment  nobody volunteered to answer that in the  chat  but uh whoever speaks or Trish is there  you go Trish and then um we haven't  heard from Anisha or Colin for a bit no  no pressure  I'm happy to  have a gem I'm not sure that I actually  have an answer and I'd have to say that  you know um artificial intelligence  literacy is an extension of digital  literacy but even now a lot of people  don't have the ability to even enter a a  valid Google search we don't know how to  use Google well in terms of searches uh  using Boolean language which is  something we were taught years ago so we  have to actually work with academics who  understand teach them how to teach  students so it's a double-edged sword in  terms of actually how we get it to the  students by empowering the or enabling  the the academic staff to know what  activities they might use looking at  things like currency validity  reliability  um doing evaluative judgment on the  source of the information and the  transparency and we also have to model  ethical use of it because ethics is a  huge thing I think there's so much  opaqueness in some of the the origins  and the algorithms associated with um  chat GPT on the route of other tunes  that are out there  I can I can jump in next  um  so I think  just from you know not timing to really  be an expert I I've really been playing  with the technology for a little bit now  since it got released and  uh my advice really is  uh especially for academics or anybody  else doing this and I do see a huge role  for learning designers as well in this  space  um is to learn Advanced prompting  um and you know I'm seeing a lot of  people  on Twitter and you know LinkedIn  whatever uh I'm taking my assessment and  I'm copying the question exactly as it  is and pasting it in and seeing what  comes to return and then picking out  weaknesses from it  um my advice is there's actually a whole  nother field that's  um being established at the moment  called prompt engineering and so this is  where you're actually rephrasing things  so that these language models better  understand it uh Chain of Thought  prompting is where you're actually  actually giving examples  um so you can you know ask a question  and then actually give a few examples  and show reasoning and then you get  better results coming from it and so  those are all the sorts of things that  people need to be aware of and using it  for more productivity type tasks will  get you into that kind of digital  literacy and these are also the skills  that that students are going to need  but what does kind of concern me is that  we're thinking of  uh the cheating element really being the  that the AI generated my assessment item  for me  I think once people uh start putting in  their own input and get their own ideas  into these tools they can craft new  Solutions and improve the quality of  what's coming out  um but for me the cheating is not really  going to be  that I've used AI from directly from  these systems the cheating might  actually be that I've built this really  great prompt and it returns really good  results and it's got all the feedback  built into it and stuff like that  and I'm now sharing that with other  students or there's prompt moles as I'm  kind of thinking of it where you can go  and and buy these particular prompts you  know for different types of assignments  and stuff like that maybe that's that  level of of cheating uh and that's where  we need to be more concerned  and that I mean that sits  so far to the side of what we would  conventionally see as cheating this kind  of collaborative generation of bronze  like no one's even thought about stuff  like that I'm quite excited about this  um  I wanted to come back to a couple of  things I think  um the things that sort of Trisha was  saying about  how essentially yeah like we really  okay let me start again  what I think this was really doing is  sorting out who  um really take a look at the standard of  quality the standard of learning and  teaching practice in institutions and  many of the suggestions that I've seen  particularly in the resources that Anna  has shared are all stuff that as  educator advisors learning designers  academics whatever we've been advocating  for for many years you know more  authentic learning experiences more  reflection  uh all of these kind of themes  and now it's like we have to do this  because  it's potentially taken us from this  level up to this level in terms of what  knowledge becomes I think in the same  way that you know calculators remove the  need to be able to do calculations with  a slide rule or you know in your head or  whatever  that bit of mathematics has gone on so  now you're working at the next level  where you've just got that tool and you  use it and now you're thinking at a  richer level about maths and we're doing  that except with writing or concepts or  information or knowledge  um  and institutions are going to need to  invest in  raising Teaching Standards and having a  much clearer understanding of what good  learning and teaching needs to look like  nice  um there's so much more to say and is  putting things in the chat about how  critical AI literacy can also mean  teaching students to recognize errors  Fabrications and bias and outputs George  is talking about the importance of  moving assessment conversations from  product to process unfortunately I'm  going to skip over those points  um because we need to get also to the  audience questions but we may cover some  of that stuff in those questions the  next move I want to make is  um to the idea of equity  and access to artificial intelligence  Technologies and tools as they become  commercialized and will they just become  a tool for the rich and what are the  implications for education of that  um Anisha I think you volunteered to  come in on this one  yeah so to me  something that's really concerning me  so  at the moment there is a free version of  chat gbt but we've seen how rapidly lots  of people started using it and then paid  Pro plans have come so you're paying  about 42 a month for it there's a new  plan for twenty dollars which is kind of  shearing up that you have access when  you need access  um  so you know I don't think these tools  are really expensive to train and  they're really expensive at the  inference level  um and so it's not going to be free  forever and I think even including it in  our class Technologies you know you  can't be reliant on on the free version  of these things but more concerning to  me really is that the whole open AI  model is that all of this is exposed as  apis and so you've got a number of third  party  uh startups and providers that use their  apis but they fine-tune it and when I  talk about fine-tuning they're actually  taking a new customized data set  um and running it over that fine-tuning  it asking it questions checking the  answers that it's giving providing  feedback and they come up with a new  customized model and this is how you're  getting these these paid Services some  of which might be more fine-tuned for  actually University assessments but this  is how you've got things like jasper.ai  for you know social media posting  um a lot of these are also incorporating  things like including references  perplexity.ai does that uh live  integration with people from alpha for  mathematical stuff but these are all  going to be paid applications and so  that's a really unfair equaling ground  for students as a starting point and  that I have no answers but other than  say just be aware of it and you know it  leads me to thoughts of you know  contract cheating sites  they would have access to a full data  set for university university written  assessment and they could find unit and  set up a new business  um  and you know these are scary things with  the future that you know we really  really need to start thinking about  I'm happy to jump in there Tim  um I think that um the digital divide  has been an issue for us right through  the pandemic and always has been  um some students will have access to the  open version of it which may be some  part of what the paid one is so even if  it if they do keep a version that is  open access that creates problems as  well but I think in terms of equity it  is also an equalizer in terms of  providing students with  um  more scaffolding and support and  personalization of their learning so  those students who perhaps have  struggled with the traditional model by  actually having this it it creates a  better sense of equity because they can  actually use it to self-teach to  self-learn to practice  um rehearse their their answers or their  knowledge  um in using the tool  and I shouldn't call it a tool someone  said on social media yesterday but  anyone who continues to call us too is a  tool  Alexander  so why does he not why does he not think  it's a fantastic tool  it's that concept of it's it's almost  post-human it's not just a tool that we  use it's something that's going to grow  and evolve with us I don't know haven't  read enough about it but I was  fascinated by the greatest I think it's  a structural imposition of a language  game and I think we're early in the  conversation on this that we don't need  to do that yet  I think we can have a lot of  conversations without active policing of  the particular type of language you're  using and I say that because we're in  the sense of every opinion right now  ridiculous or not has some place to sit  in this conversational ecosystem  and I think I'm a little worried if  we're like well you can't say exactly  this or you can't say exactly that  because that's the outcome there is no  outcome yet we don't have a structure on  which we can hang this as a tool  efficient moderation Tim  um Lisa made a really good point about  the equity dynamics of it uh if you  bring this into a classroom you know  twenty dollars a month uh for the pro  version of the US which is where it's  only available right now is going to put  a lot of students Out Of Reach In in  that landscape they say well there'll be  a free version but then now you have the  same thing there's certain better things  in the paid version and you have an  unequal landscape so I think that is a  first doorway that needs to be addressed  in the conversation  after we've passed through that doorway  I would suggest almost all conversations  related to Ai and chat GPT in education  are secondary to my thinking to the  enormous potential this has for a  creative explosion for an Innovative way  of engaging and interacting with the  world I'm not trying to belittle that  there's concerns that that are there but  I'm trying to say you know what I get it  it's fantastic there's a risk that if I  go to Tahiti that I might get a virus  once I'm there I'm going I'm going to  figure out how to deal with the medical  system later so uh but I do want to  emphasize the one that's non-negotiable  are the equity of the the harm that can  be caused especially the minority  population that one needs to be tackled  up front but beyond that I don't want to  I hope we don't Focus too much on all of  this peripheral stuff  that has to be navigated  and we ignore this stunning potential I  mean it is amazing to sit there and have  it recite how to make a peanut butter  and jelly sandwich in the style of King  James uh like that that's it's just a  fun thing to morph information from a  JavaScript code into Python and to have  that happen in real time I mean that is  uh everything else aside from the equity  and the harm conversation is a secondary  concern so bring on the good stuff and  backfill uh the visit to ER later  you've done a beautiful job for me  um uh because the next question was  going to be uh what are the key things  that you would like Educators to know  about artificial intelligence  Technologies not tools  um and the kinds of advances that they  can expect in the next year we'll go to  Anisha first but I suspect George will  have a few things to say on that as well  all right can I just quickly interrupt  for a second uh this is actually just a  request to attendees  um in the Q a we've now  um activated the ability to upload  questions obviously there's a lot of  questions there's 90 odd questions in  there  um if you could go through and just vote  for the questions that you like the most  that might help us um actually make some  make some progress on on those questions  sorry thank you although I don't I don't  promise to adhere to your voting system  it's not a democracy  um but but yes it will help us  um it will help indicate uh yeah so  Anisha um what are the things you think  Educators what what are the things you  would like Educators to know about chat  GPT and other Technologies and the  advances they can expect in the next  year and if George or Anna or anybody  else has  um good things to say then just come in  on the back of that please  um so I think what's already happening  is a race with startups in all the  different directions and and fine-tuning  data sets  um from the educational perspective I  think it's going to be much easier to  actually build  a  chat box with reasoning that can  actually answer questions related to  your course content because it's going  to be easier to build semantic search  that's fine-tuned on your course and I'm  starting to see this from different  websites and different sites so it's  much better than any of the chatbots  that are currently out there and it can  also do things like explain things in  better ways to students so you know you  can go I'm having I'm struggling with  this particular concept and even have  things like study advisors recommending  learning strategies to students and  stuff like that  um  you know I think this is the question of  you know should Educators be actually  making lesson plans and generating  content  my thoughts on this is we're really  thinking of this as static content you  know  um and you know you know  do it really want our Educators instead  of  writing things out fully to be using  this technology when we don't want  students to be using it and things like  that so  my thinking on that really is  if we move away from thinking of the  output of these systems as static  content and static lesson plans which  you might already have  um and more to the level that it's going  to be dynamic Interactive  question answering and concept  explaining  systems that we can build around to  actually help students that might be  having trouble or want to you know make  different notes about things and things  like that  um that takes it to that different level  um I think the key thing also for  educators and and learning designers is  just the productivity aspect  you know  um I would not really encourage anybody  at this point in time until there's  clear guidance from you know your  employee about generating this content  and using it in your work like you know  doing paper writing with it or doing  other things but  for me the big potential and  opportunities are actually in not what  we are experts in  so it's those other tasks that we have  to do  uh you know it might be that you have to  you have a table in a certain format and  you need it in another format in in  latex for your paper chat gbt is great  at converting those formats it might be  that there's a range of other  technologies that you know you as a  learning designer  you are working with a platform that  supports HTML and you want to customize  things and something's air it out you  just copy that HTML  get your gbt to try and fix it for you  so these are these side tasks that we  have to do you know I've even seen  things like somewhat not know how to use  Excel but describe the problem in chat  gbt and it actually is replying with you  know here's what you do as your formulas  for these particular cells and it knows  how to do that kind of stuff really well  um these are all things that can help us  in productivity Without Really  infringing on you know our core learning  designer pedagogy knowledge or writing  for us or in any of those particular  areas so I really encourage people to  experiment with those particular  tasks that they're doing were they not  expert but they have to do it day to day  and you're usually Landing up using  Google search to try and find something  chat gbt might know the direct answer  so that would be my advice to educators  yeah I just wanted to add  um that there are significant  or that open AI is planning to come out  with um a version that's significantly  better  um  and that the underlying structure of the  technology is likely to remain the same  so there are certain limitations to what  language models can do  um because they're looking at word  prediction they're not drawing on sort  of  um an underlying reasoning structure or  ground truth and this is something Gary  Marcus talks about a lot but  um so even when we we might use them to  learn things there are kinds of errors  and fabrications that we might see that  are coming from that that they're  they're just predicting what words are  likely to go together they don't  necessarily they're not you know  operating out of understanding in the  way that we might be  um so we're likely to still see those  kinds of  um structural limitations and we're  likely to see some big  um potentially big jumps in quality we  can't count on  um you know some of the mistakes that  they're currently making or limits on  um on the outputs now  on there  right so  um this has been fantastic and and uh  you know I suppose we could be talking  for hours on this but because we only  have 15 minutes left  it seems appropriate to shift across to  audience q a  um and there are a lot of popular  questions about acknowledgment and  referencing so I might just smush them  all into a garbled version that I come  up with and then throw it open to the  field  um and it it seems to me to boil down to  practical advice around how we might  treat the referencing of  um of artificial intelligence  um the interrogation of references  produced by artificial intelligence and  the ways in which we might  define acceptable and unacceptable uses  of artificial intelligence within  assignments  we're just going to drop a quick note in  there Tim on on that I think it's a good  a good question I think there was a  large language model that meta developed  called the Galactica they ran for about  three days and then people got extremely  upset because it was literally just  making up citations one thing that's  important to look at chat GPT is  currently taking all the oxygen out of  the room but it's a small company open  AI it's been very well designed from a  public-facing interface for me by far  the big elephant in the world is Google  and Google's very broad range of  platforms some of their protein folding  research that they've done through  deepmind is has the capacity to change  the quality of human Humanity's life  everywhere Beyond teaching us how in  chat GPT how to make a recipe for for  pasta and related shopping list so  there's real practical work that AI is  doing in research Labs it's unfortunate  that chat GPT is drawing that oxygen out  as sort of the Soul entity there's a lot  of other things going on that I think  are quite a bit more impactful down the  road so I just want to briefly flag that  that's something I don't want us to lose  sight of is that that's going to become  a growing conversation that we need to  focus on  I was just wondering if um if Trish has  someone sort of in a leadership role in  this space you might be able to tell us  a little bit about  um the direction Deacon's taking when it  comes to expectations of citations and  referencing  have you Frozen  I think true nicely played Trish nicely  played  uh well in that case I might I might  speak to it a little bit  um some of the I mean obviously this has  been a significant discussion that I've  um certainly seen  and uh one of the better responses  actually saw was from um  University of California San Diego I  thought their policy response has been  really sensible and I think I actually  pinched that from Anna's um collection  of resources  um and it's essentially acknowledgment  um if you don't acknowledge that you're  using the tool  um then yeah it's  it's essentially contract cheating so  in the student work obviously you need  to work out how much is acceptable I  mean are you providing  um what's the track changes on your  document so that you can see which parts  you've imported which parts you've  actually written do you go through a  series of steps where you're showing  draw so you can actually see the  development of your work or are you  showing the prompt that you used and the  changes that you made for that I think  this is probably  um the conversation the big conversation  that we need to be having in terms of  um assessment work and just  acknowledgment and referencing and  citation of it now I'm aware that  there's a bunch of um  academic journals and scientific  journals that are saying yet you cannot  have chat GTP as a co-author and gets  that kind of makes sense  um but yeah bringing it back to the  Practical kind of education Focus that's  just wondering if anyone had specific  thoughts on that  or move on to another question I'm uh  I'm pointing to Anna in the chat but  Anna may not  may not be prepared you might want to do  a Trish what you do right is you just  hold your face really really still for  about three seconds and then we we  assume there's a technical problem and  we move on to someone else  um  yeah so I I wasn't quite ready for that  one no that's fine that's fine  um  so okay nobody knows the answer to some  of these questions that's fine  um we're still working all of this out I  think one of the other questions I was  pretty interested in it relates to a  question that Colin also fancied I don't  know who should answer this one I'm glad  I'm not on the panel  um in terms of chat GPT and other  artificial intelligence Technologies  being used by staff where are the lines  there for example would it ever be  appropriate to use them for marking and  feedback of students work  so my take on that is it's a technology  it's not illegal it makes us smarter it  makes us it it solves mundane tasks that  allow us to you know Elevate or move up  the ranking of creativity or to solve  more complex tasks and activities so my  take on it is if it's legal and if you  can use it use it uh teach students how  to use it like I'm all AI all the time  there's a big difference between legal  and moral  no there is but I'm saying like from one  end how would you frame that in this  case in what aspect of using it as an as  a teacher would would you define as  being uh immoral or is there a domain at  which like if I'm going to use it to  give students better feedback on their  assignments where would you cross over  into an immoral line in that end from  your perspective I guess I have a few  thoughts like  how are we in a position where a  computer can give better feedback than  an educator  um and you know that's that's a much  broader discussion for Learning and  teaching  um I wonder how students would respond  if they  should there be acknowledgment that  their feedback has been generated  through AI are students going to feel as  though they're kind of being robbed of  the teacher doing their job in some ways  may not I I get it it's a tool and maybe  it is actually helpful  I think there's a whole other question  is if the feedback goes wrong and the  student follows it and the student fails  and they appeal their grade what how  does the institution deal with that  Trish is nodding  I'm nodding I'm happy to say my  apologies um I had a bit of a technical  malfunction there thanks to eduron as  those guys in Australia you know that  that's our system so I had a frantically  a hot spot and yeah look I'm sorry I  missed the last question and and with  this  the the one about uh should we use  students uh put students material into  it or mark their work I think that Phil  Dawson has had quite a few thoughts on  that one around its student data and  putting it into a a an opaque  system where we don't know how that  information will be used but in terms of  actually getting the the bot to write  feedback they've been doing that for  years school reports now are usually  generated with automatic can responses  that are put in and the kids recognize  it so you know so all this teacher says  that you're good at whatever or you're  doing well they didn't write that that  came from you know and that that's  a normal practice so where the responses  come from or who writes them is um  students quickly figure out authenticity  and  care Factor  I wonder let's say a rubric you know how  is a rubric different than using chat  GPT  can generate some brilliant rubrics  rubric is a pre-structured model well I  guess what I'm trying to get I'm trying  to unpack I think Colin raised a really  important topic which is where does the  morale  the using the technology to provide  feedback you can start to run into a  line that makes people uncomfortable and  what is it specifically about chat GPT  when we use different Technologies and  tools all the time in our teaching our  evaluation I'm not quite sure if this  Liberty student failing but uh you know  it's it's I think a question to unpack  on what  look like  oh and  I should just jump in quickly here I I  actually think  um again to my a point I think I made  previously is that we of course might be  looking at it as you know this this the  usual ways that students submits an  assignment then there's this one-step  feedback that comes back I actually  think that's sort of flow we need to  start thinking about as a chat bot that  perhaps students might interact with to  get feedback incrementally on what  they're doing and that takes much better  advantage of what the underlying  Technologies and um what chat gbt as a  chatbot is is quite good at it's how we  prompt it to give and train it to give  those right uh responses and you know  there's a lot of you know I think from  UTS there's a lot of learning analytics  research on writing analytics and it's  how we combine all of that with the chat  GPT technology to actually get these  incremental writing feedback or you know  problem solving feedback integrated in  what we do it's it's less to me about  um the feedback comments that an  academic might write right at the end  it's you know it's been part of the  learning process and integrating these  tools into the learning process and I  think then students are less likely to  get upset that it's written by an AI  so here we are  um we're three minutes to go thinking  we've covered an awful lot of territory  and there needs to be some sort of  um  way of closing down a session that is  massively open covers a lot of territory  we want it to be reasonably positive so  we could go to George for this but then  we also have a lot of people I think in  the audience who are quite worried about  their short-term practical side of  things  um so I'm thinking about Anna and I'm  thinking about George if you can just  start readying your minds for like a  kind of maybe  a final statement from Anna about some  sort of practical approach that you  could take in the short term  um and then something from George to  make us feel better about the future and  then I call in if you want  um you might want to say a final word as  the sort of organizer of this session  does that sound okay but please uh keep  it brief because otherwise people will  have to  believe during your amazing statements  okay  um I would just say to focus in our  assessments on intrinsic motivation and  engagement with students and to just  start to establish these Norm of  transparency around when we're using  AI assistance and when we're not and how  we're using it and that can go along  with some introduction of a  critical AI literacy  um as we're learning we can share with  students some basic information about  how these models work and what their  limitations are and you know that may  lead to discussions of what their  appropriate uses are  um so I'll stop there  well I just I think I you know I don't  want to be sort of pollyanish in the  general orientation I think I'm  encouraged though by the ways in which  AI can handle routine sort of uh  systemically relevant but learning  irrelevant activities and I so I think  that is the sort of dynamic that I see  promising um I also see it promising  that there's you know genuine degree of  excitement around learning and engaging  with ideas and shaping and sharing and  creating and the thrill of discovering  something new I think the part that  still fascinates me most about chat GPT  is the ready trend expert from one  information state to another information  state with whatever layer you've added  over it whether it is in the style of  Shakespeare or Bell hooks or whatever it  is that you end up doing I think that's  the part that we we shouldn't lose sight  of our existential angst of oh my  goodness what's it going to do what's it  going to do an experience that we're  actually in a really fascinating  explosive period of time of direct  engagement with learning learning system  of public conversation on I think that's  important as I noted earlier there there  are key issues around the consequences  of equity and access that cannot be  ignored those are first line  conversation and the second first  conversation is around harm especially  to people who are traditionally  marginalized or exclude from the school  system those are non-negotiables in the  conversation everything that follows  later once we've had or at least made  that Central to the ongoing discussion  the rest of the details we backfill  I made it through the entire thing  without talking on mute now there we go  um look this has been a wonderful  session and I would really like to thank  everyone who's been involved in this  um I feel incredibly  um encouraged about the vibe and just  the general kind of thinking that is  going on we're mindful of the  accessibility the equity the fairness  um and the opportunities in this space  um  or Educators and advisors and leaders  out there I think we just need to keep  this conversation going and  think about all the ways that this will  potentially reshape learning and  teaching  so  um thank you also Tim obviously for  doing such a marvelous job wrangling out  um the next televisors webinar will be  at the start or at the end of February  and it will be again with a focus on AI  and specifically academic Integrity  questions and we will promote some  information with that so with that I  will thank you all and um  have a great day  [Music]
