 hello everyone and welcome to the  ventures podcast I'm excited to share  this conversation with Alex shalash with  you he is the co-founder and co-ceo of  meta engine and they are providing a  infrastructure for anyone who's building  metaverses to be able to have the  technology available to interoperate  with lots of other metaverses out there  and it's an engine that is highly  compelling so along the way in this  conversation we talk about uh chat GPT  which is all the rage the last week we  talked talk about gtp4 and how these new  AI you know our new AI overlords are  going to be present and and what the  implications are in different metaverse  spaces and sort of web 3 in general so  if you're listening to this conversation  you can also watch by visiting  wclittle.com there I'll have more  extensive show notes different links to  the things that we talk about today  and if you're watching you can also  listen anywhere that you get your  podcast you can search for ventures and  it should show up so with that please  enjoy this conversation with Alex  shalosh  [Music]  all right Alex welcome to the show  thanks for having me will yeah I'm  excited for this conversation uh there's  a lot going on metaverse world web 3 uh  it's definitely been an exciting year uh  exciting in quotation uh marks  uh love to start out just tell us a  little bit about uh yourself your  background and how you how you got on  the web three  you know it has been a a roller coaster  right first huge excitement a year ago  then kind of  you know wobbling around there and then  you know a big uh disappointment with  some some news from the market that um  yeah so um uh where do I come from and  what's what what you know how I got to  web3  um I have been for the last 12 years  have been involved on the game  development infrastructure side was a  company uh called the deer fabric we  developed and owned a game development  engine for massively multiplayer online  games  and about a year ago a little over a  year ago in the summer last year we  started seeing a lot of projects being  funded on the metaverse side and a lot  of game five projects and so on uh so we  got really curious you know what kind of  Technology are they using because when  you say metaverse is in in our  understanding metaverse is really all  about scale  um massive multi-user massive  multi-developer also huge in scale  multiple experiences and so on we see  that as kind of a huge collection of of  massively participatory experiences and  the majority of the the projects that we  have seen were relatively Limited in  both in scale in scope in number of  players and also they they even limited  themselves to a smaller map so they  would have limited number of plots so  that that would on one side would be  good for the real virtual real estate  economy but it would uh not allow for  that you know Gram expansion right in  general uh of the space so um what we  ended up with is at the end of last year  we came into web3 Market by saying look  there is there are professional  technologies that are being used in  traditional game development let us  bring those Technologies into the web 3  space and help web development sorry web  3D experiences in game developers to to  create much more interesting highly  scalable types of experiences so that's  that's how we started about a year ago  cool cool yeah I recently read Matthew  Ball's book on the on the metaverse he  paints a pretty interesting picture of  how hard it is because we're limited by  the speed of light we're limited by  computation we're limited by all kinds  of connectivity issues we're limited by  interoperative operability uh issues in  terms of coming to standards uh you know  all the sort of business incentives etc  etc around that  how how do you think about when when's  when somebody casually on the street  says hey Alex  what are we going to have the metaverse  like ready player one or snow crash or  any of those I recently read snow crash  too which was interesting  um kind of late to the game on that one  Wendy when do you say uh  how do you answer that question  I answered that question by saying um do  not expect it to be here soon  and especially yeah because of those uh  challenges that you just mentioned that  Matthew is communicating through both  his strategy work and also in his book  uh I actually subscribed strongly to his  definition of metaverse not many other  differences  so I do believe this is you know when  you look at the com if you break down  his definition of what metaverse is in  his view it really fits with that  massively scalable massive participation  massive activity  um interoperability and many of those  and when you start ticking those tick  boxes you really understand that this  that's not a trivial task uh to to  resolve and it's going to take a long  time the one good thing is that we do  with meta engine we do have technology  that was used already for massively  scalable experiences so or games and  simulations so one can reuse some of  that technology uh one thing that  Matthew is not um  emphasizing a lot is the is the the web  3 directly the web3 part of it he is  more focusing on the experience and um  what I believe that metaverse is at that  meta engine we're building that  infrastructure for is a it's digital  asset ownership through which we we are  all going to both participate not only  as users players but also as part owners  of those experiences so that's kind of  part of that web free definition  um that if one were to add it on top  that's where we come in because our  motto because behind the platform and  the product is really providing a full  infrastructure spectrum of all  infrastructure pieces that are required  for you to build those experiences and  you if you are a Creator just coming in  and and do something using those tools  got it got it okay so help us understand  where you are on the stack  um in terms of building right I mean  over the summer  I participated in yoga Labs you know  other side the first journey in I think  they used M square m Square technology  right  um uh which I think at least that group  is doing I know at least one other  metaverse or something yeah it seems  like they're working on a bunch of  different things but where where do you  fit in the stack and who should be  building like who should be partnering  with you and building and building with  you  right so um when you look at if we take  the other side the M2 you know that that  whole basically the uh the group behind  this is um improbable right improvable  right so improbable guys they have um  they tried to integrate  different engines and provide that  unifying platform  um it looks to us that they have uh  basically have taken and built plugins  into unreal and unity in order to enable  some of the experiences that need  networking right so for multiplayer  experiences and this was the other side  demo that we have seen was exactly to  highlight that those capabilities the  difference  um so we are actually sitting kind of  we're covering all the whole Spectrum so  we do have  similarly to Unreal and unity we have  the rendering engine  which allows you to to see what is on  the screen right  um we have what the other side is doing  which is you know the networking the  server infrastructure we do have a  database fully integrated which allows  for real-time development collaboration  and and finally it will allow also for  asset interoperability and in addition  to this we're about building as as I  mentioned before a full stack for web3  uh of web 3 functionality that would  allow for uh digital asset ownership  decentralized storage plus also security  provided by the blockchain itself are  you using polygon and R weave and others  with that are you building your own or  what what tech is behind that so that  right so we are building a polygon to  start with okay but the idea is a  polygon is uh was one of our seed  investors as well in the company so um  we are also building  um a the the in the future multi change  support uh because we as two providers  cannot really Force developers to tell  them look this blockchain or that  blockchain right especially now with so  much volatility on in that market  um yeah it's it's better to have many of  those at least core blockchain platforms  covered so we always we cater to as many  projects as possible yeah yeah it's good  that's good okay so basically if I were  to have a you know a sizable nft  Community for example like a comparison  to a Yuga yep instead of working with  improbable I'd work with you is that  essentially because you have more web3  native built in is that is that what I'm  hearing correctly it's uh it's actually  both so we do have much longer  experience on the web 2 side  um there are we at least not publicly  known there are no  um MMO Games built on  um on improbables technology they simply  there are none of them are public uh  although there are several projects that  were announced some of the projects that  were built our original technology have  been running for more than 10 years now  as MMO games right so we we covered the  web 2 side because of that experience  which you know 20 years in in total 20  years in the gaming infrastructure plus  we are integrating the web to web free  features that that allow for basically  building  um a broader architecture that you can  rely on as a Creator to build your  product  so as a Creator am I still writing in C  sharp or C plus plus with unreal and  unity type things or is this a different  are you approaching it differently with  a different engine so no I mean we uh  our core engine is in C plus plus okay  some of the tools that I expose to the  outside communication date c-sharp and  we do have also our internal scripting  language called hero script and that's  uh I like to say scripting language that  allows for uh basically everything to to  manipulate everything on what you see on  the screen through networking and server  management as well okay so all the rage  the last week has been uh you know hints  of of GT GPT 4 uh What uh five six days  ago uh open AI released chat GPT I'm  curious how how like Ai and and this  type of content production  is going to impact the metaverse it  seems like we're gonna have maybe  non-player characters that are going to  be extremely intelligent that are going  to be AIS walking around  uh I don't know what are your thoughts  on this have you have you played around  with any any of this yet and and what  are your thoughts in terms of its  implications this coming year  um I think I haven't played around  myself uh but um the the thinking on our  side is that the more tools you have the  better uh the core the Richer the  experience that you can create it is the  better I mean we even with phone  um some of the phone services sometimes  you don't even know if you speak to a  real person onto a AI  um to to have a real person always  guiding you through your experiences it  will probably be too you know cumbersome  complicated maybe even expensive so AI  definitely has huge potential in that  but more importantly I think is when we  have the crossover between  the entertainment part of the metaverse  and also the  what we can do like I I we were talking  to one potential client and these guys  are saying look so I want to create  something that is sustainable something  where I can also do what we call serious  games in that environment which means  maybe simulating some of the you know  processes that I have I'm running in  real life and that's where I think AI  really has a huge opportunity to step in  whether you are creating a smart city  that is running and digital twin and a  metaverse that helps you to optimize  your traffic optimize your pollution  optimize many of the city management  tools all the way through you know a  really boring uh from from an  entertainment point of view really  boring tasks like you know managing your  infrastructure and things like this that  that are currently very difficult to do  so I believe that AI has implications on  all all the sites not only the  entertainment side  yeah yeah for sure because if if because  we're basically talking to this this AI  now I mean they just crossed a million  users I think today in five six days  um we're basically talking to an AI and  asking in all kinds of questions you  know it's it's basically our Oracle  right we're we're asking its opinion on  what we should do about ABC and and it's  giving out extremely thoughtful answers  it's sort of an interesting corollary to  a to a Google search think think about  it as um you know kids of the future but  even already today as USA right that  they are going to use AI instead of  their teachers to answer their questions  right because yes the teachers have  studied and they are Professionals in uh  in some subjects but they they might not  have the same depth of understanding of  some of the uh parts of the curriculum  especially if it is in just a little bit  outside of the core right so  um having Ai and creating those kind of  call it gamification of education type  of experiences will be perfect because  all of a sudden you know I I look at my  kids you know they they learn a lot  through watching YouTube videos  which I explained explanatory right uh  in in nature they're trying to simplify  some of the difficult things whether  you're you're looking at physics math or  any kind of science or or even the  latest developments right so I think we  have ai has huge potential on that side  we even had in the earlier days we had a  similar kind of idea we were planning to  develop with Watson you remember how how  Watson was uh you know how how big it  was supposed to become right  um we don't know what really happened  there but the idea was really Watson  could source of that all that the  knowledge and obviously based on  probabilities of whatever answers they  would provide you with certain answers  for specific uh subject of questions  yeah yeah so maybe our AI overlords can  help us with this next question but it's  uh the up I'm very curious about the  combination of the interoperability  between these metaverses  and the incentives  for the game makers and for all the  for-profit companies that are that are  would normally in a web 2 Paradigm want  to keep everyone in their silos and keep  them super engaged so they make more and  more money and extract as much sort of  rent or cash out of their users as they  possibly can but that world is Shifting  right and we're going to have to have  interoperability we're going to have to  figure out mechanics so that people can  still make money as entrepreneurs  and businesses can Thrive but users have  this this this way of moving assets  around  how do you think that this is all going  to go down uh I'm I'm really curious  what this is what this is going to look  like  yeah so I think uh this this is the  biggest difference uh in terms of Prior  time shift between web 2 and web3 right  it's the ownership culture So currently  you have uh large whether it's game  Publishers or social platforms they own  your data they own  um and when you buy for example a  digital asset within a certain whether  you buy skin in a game or anything like  this you really are stuck to that  specific game you cannot take it out  it's not something that if the game  publisher decides to shut down the game  that you can carry on and have it as  your collectible at some point you know  20 years down the line it will remind  you of some really great times you have  and at the same time maybe you know  somebody else would appreciate it as  well if you needed to  um the large Publishers when they invest  billions of dollars into creating those  games and experiences they are expecting  to receive a return right to build a you  know a big franchise game can cost you  between 100 and 500 million dollars  right so you're not expecting the the  public to pick it up that's that's why  you know  from a get-go right so you are creating  subscription models you are selling  skins and you're doing all that stuff  inside the game in order for you to to  get a return on on that investment uh  the more we move into web 3 world the  more the ownership is going to shift and  it doesn't have to be 100 of ownership  of a specific product but the ownership  it will shift to the players so players  will be able to use some of that  um and and keep those assets  um we see also  uh some of the larger nft collections  like you you mentioned yoga and was  there a great nft collection although it  did lose some value uh due to the market  correction but if you had a great  following  um behind the behind your collection you  had you built millions of followers uh  it's the easiest way to bring them into  some kind of interactive experience  instead of just having it as a  collectible that's that's where the  other side uh game in general the idea  or the other side metaverse idea came  from but there are so many other  collections that have built large  following and those followers they are  now looking for use cases of what they  have in their wallets because just  sitting on it and looking at its value  it's not fun  so we see a much higher participation  from from those collection owners in  actually in the creation of those  experiences whether they will  will be a Kickstarter type of idea right  where they can bring this in or it can  be also them simply becoming the  audience or the potential players of  those games  so if I were to think optimistically  then that for for in terms of the  consumer right The Gamers the people who  want to spend time on these metaverses  it could it hopefully if we're able to  figure out interoperability standards  and move in between different  blockchains or whatever  it hopefully will just be a I can you  know if I have a sword or a gun or or an  avatar with certain armor or a shirt or  shoes or whatever I like or my car  uh hopefully optimistically I can bring  that to who whatever metaverse is  willing to participate in that and and  the game makers and the metaverse makers  are incentivized to want to under  operate because they want me to bring  all my stuff in and then maybe they can  sell me stuff very similar to going  around IRL to different shops or  different stores or different cities  um if they're going to attract me with  their skiing or with their surfing or  with their you know whatever whatever  I'm into then then I'm gonna do Commerce  you know the sort of like the tourism  economy so I wonder if the tourism  economy is going to be analogous whoever  creates the best experiences in this  sort of multi-multiverse uh is going to  be able to attract users and then  extract some kind of rent or some kind  of Commerce from us uh to just make it  better for everyone is that how you see  this going down or is that am I way too  optimistic there I think uh so uh yes  um and and no so the yes is definitely  uh capability of using your what you own  right you bought an avatar on a on a  third-party Avatar creation website so  you are not linked to any specific game  then you got skins and everything and  you like it so why not be able to use it  in a in a game or metaverse  so if you have that capability of  Crossing between different experiences  that's that's exactly the platform that  we're building having uh having  capabilities of moving between different  worlds uh also multi-chain capabilities  will allow you to to bring  those items from different chains into  the same environment so you don't have  to yourself get involved in you know  trading swapping and thinking of how to  deal with those at the same time  um also I do believe that we should not  try to commercialize everything  yeah because I I think that's that's  what killed game five uh too much uh  commercialization in a way uh that um  your traditional Gamers  um and people that just want to be there  because their friends are there they  just want to you know hang out right if  you if you put a price tag on it or if  it costs you  several you know you know tens of  dollars to get in plus you have to go  through complicated wallet you know  buying some uh not well-known token yeah  in order just to participate that is  going to be difficult to build big  audiences and I think this this barriers  of the main reasons why we do not have a  huge adoption  that too much commercialization  I mean as a tradition if you ask any  traditional gamer they're not playing  there to make money they're playing that  we have fun and to hang out with their  friends  [Music]  yeah that's right so what are you most  excited about then in web 3 in the  metaverse and what you're building like  what's what's it in the one two three  year Horizon like what are the what are  the things that you're you're pretty  amped up about  so what I'm the most excited is actually  creating that bridge  when when you started talking about  metaverse uh so the nft collections and  some somebody else has been building  experience we have uh uh capability of  uh creating a real Creator economy sorry  for uh  using creating career but uh really  bringing uh people with multiple skills  onto the plot onto the platform where  they can express themselves whether  whether you are good at creating  2dr or a 3D object or you can program or  you just want to to hang out with with  your friends that have built this  so as part of the platform we're  actually creating a community platform  as well which will focus specifically on  on the creative individuals across  different  um  different types of art let's say that  they can bring in at the same time  providing them with relatively easy oh I  mean you can go really deep and and very  complicated Technologies but at the same  time also you can build some simpler  experiences so bringing that together uh  expanding the the usage of tools  uh into not just your you know  traditional or professional game  developers but building a much larger  audience that uh that's where I think we  will see over the next couple of years a  big change and then the participation  from different uh people through  collaboration right one of the biggest  advantages of our platform is real-time  collaboration so similarly to if you and  I were working on a in a collaborative  environment like Google Docs and we we  start writing something I see what you  write I I can add additional content or  start changing all happening in real  time that is Imagine blowing that up to  a full three-dimensional multiplayer  environment that you can see everybody  in that environment whether they're a  player or they are Developer and you see  the changes happening in front of your  eyes that's the type of technology that  we're providing and that's where we we  think that that that's how the metaverse  is going to develop as well although you  know maybe it's not going to call  metaverse or these are going to be these  chunks of it but we will start with some  experiences and then we'll start adding  them but adding them in real time so I  don't we don't have to kick players out  to upgrade to the next version or the  next additional content but it's  actually is going to grow in front of  your eyes more or less like internet was  growing although you had to go to a  specific website to to see the content  so if I understand correctly then the  people that should come build with you  your goal if I were to State it would be  to have multiple projects multiple  projects using your same technology  because they'll be they'll have the web  three components and the  interoperability built in is that right  correct okay  what's that I couldn't have said it  better wonderful so all these new  projects spinning up and it's it's this  is timely because I'm working on a  project called Alfie right now which is  meant to be Community journalism across  multiple technology like all these nft  projects that are coming up and the  Alfie is going to have this fun lore  component to it and alfies are going to  be responsible for reporting to the  community what's going on in these  different communities so if we had a  partner and it sounds like this is you  who is saying hey if you're going to  build into the metaverse you're going to  build up these teams uh we know that we  know the person to talk to okay so with  that where can people find you where can  people learn more where can people reach  out and and continue the conversation  yes so we uh we just relaunched our  website although if you go there sorry  if there are a couple of things that are  being adjusted in in real time as we  speak  dot GG for good game nice and um you  know there is there is a contact form at  the bottom of it uh you can sign up  directly or you can find me whether on  LinkedIn Alex Challenge on LinkedIn or  uh just reach out through the website  would be the main the kind of the best  in the easiest way to manage  um and uh yeah and we will be launching  as I said not only the the game  development tools and Technologies but  at the same time communities uh that are  going to be focused on specific parts  that those or they they're just fans of  specific uh with some interests that  will be building together so we we are  really looking at the whole thing is as  our slogan built bigger and better so  but it's actually built together I I  would say it even even more important  wonderful wonderful Alex has been a  great chat really appreciate your time  I really appreciate your time and thank  you for great questions hope we we  continue this at some at the later point  would love that would love that all  right take care great thank you very  much have a nice day  [Music]  all right a couple quick things before  you go number one I have a general  newsletter where I write about  technology and startups and health  science and teaching people to code and  I write about a variety of different  subjects that we talk about on this show  so if you go to wclittle.com there  you'll be able to subscribe and you'll  also be able to subscribe to particular  topics if you're just interested in one  or a few of them you'll be notified  right when I publish new content in  those areas  number two my partners and I at Pro  Adventures have a portfolio company  called startup rocket if you go to  startuprocket.com there you'll be able  to receive coaching guides and customize  an operations framework for you and your  team and your advisors to be on the same  page in terms of what is the appropriate  next step for you and your  entrepreneurial Journey  and finally if you wouldn't mind leaving  a review anywhere that you have listened  to this podcast or watch this podcast  it'd be super helpful to help those who  might be interested in consuming this  content as well  thank you
