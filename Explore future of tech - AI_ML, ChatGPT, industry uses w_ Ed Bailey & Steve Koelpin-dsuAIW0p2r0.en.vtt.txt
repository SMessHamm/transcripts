 welcome to the cribble live stream it's  Ed Bailey from cribble I am the tech  evangelist with Steve colpen Steve  Copeland is a noted and noted expert in  machine learning I've worked with Steve  for years working on solving just  challenging data and observability  challenges and uh one of the things that  has just really come up over and over  again lately is how Ai and ml  particularly chat GPT are it's just  impacting the engineering landscape so  of course Steve came to mind about you  know let's let's get the low down here  and I reach out to Steve and of course  Steve is knee-deep in this already Steve  can you introduce yourself yeah sure so  first off thanks for having me Ed so I'm  Steve colpen I've been an engineer now  for almost a decade and uh solving  complex problems through data and uh use  a lot of machine learning and starting  to dive into this artificial  intelligence now and that's what we'll  be talking about today is AI and using  chat GPT  yeah it's super exciting so I'm not  noticed for organization but I have  created some organization today so we're  gonna have a couple of a few topics so  just like kind of go through these  topics and those kind of go back and  forth about you tell me about the topics  we'll talk about the value  all right so this is what we're going to  be talking about today so how to use Ai  and machine learning to help help  engineers in their daily daily uh list  of what they have to do or daily items  that they have to do and how it can make  Engineers much more efficient so the  four topics that we're going to  primarily be talking about is  summarizing unfamiliar topics so explain  new Concepts coming in technology is  changing fast so it's important to stay  on top of new trends and new new ways to  solve hard problems next up I love this  I think helping Engineers learn new  things fast is incredibly important as  you mentioned things are everything's  changing so fast you know Engineers need  help  oh yeah  next up we'll be talking about getting  better faster results from scripts and  queries so using the AI to help you  write queries and write different  Scripts  next we'll be talking about  troubleshooting so having your own  personal assistant available to help you  troubleshoot problems  and lastly we'll talk about uh  evaluating tools and faster ways to  understand who the players are and and  what you're trying to solve  these are all ideal  um as you know we work together with  Splunk for example and it's a huge issue  with any kind of observability tools  getting users to write good queries and  having an assistant that any user can  then reach out to to optimize queries  and just it helps scale your new  engineering team so much better because  you're not spending time getting bogged  down and every single user's issues and  scripts I mean better you know better  faster scripts you can't beat that  troubleshooting is another one  troubleshooting is a discipline and  unfortunately most of your  troubleshooting at 4 AM when things are  going to hell and having something that  can bring that steadiness that  methodical that help help backstop and  bring a steady methodical approach it's  just it's just it's invaluable truly  invaluable  all right Steve you want to share your  desktop and let's get started absolutely  let me go ahead and take over  all right  should be popping up now so as many  you've probably heard multiple times it  can you see my screen  here I'm adding it  all right  let's go ahead and uh get started on  topic number one  summarizing complex topics so one of the  new trends that have recently emerged  lately was observability so the first  question that we'll go ahead and ask it  is can you explain  observability and for you for those of  you who may be unfamiliar with o11y that  simply stands for 11 letters between the  O and the Y which uh it's kind of  shorthand for observability so we're  going to ask chat GP can you explain  observability in 50 words or less  all right  got a simple question there let me go  ahead and reload this  all right let's try again can you  explain  in 50 words or less like I'm a child  [Music]  that's awesome  okay  sure observability Ollie stands for  observability it means being able to see  and understand what's happening in a  computer system like a robot or a  website it helps people who work on the  system to find and fix complex problems  so it can run smoothly so now let's  elaborate a bit more explain like I'm a  highly technical engineer  and notice the persistence here as well  so I didn't have to re I didn't have to  re-ask it the original question can you  explain observability it remembered that  or it persisted what I asked it prior  and so I'm asking it to explain like I'm  a highly technical engineer and so I'm  not going to read all of this but just  looking at the first sentence or two  Ollie or observability is a term that  refers to the ability to understand the  internal state of a distributed system  by collecting analyzing and presenting  metrics traces and logs pretty accurate  so yeah I mean I got to give it credit  yeah that's pretty good and and if we  were to grab that and paste it into  Google  it's not it's not pulled from any direct  source and just not repeating what it  got what it found on the internet it's  it's deducing this through logic and  reasoning and describing what it is  so next up let's go ahead and uh add a  little humor to it so let's go ahead and  then let's have it explain  how about we do a Stone Cold Steve  Austin those who may have grew up in the  80s or 90s wrestling let's have uh let's  have it explain it like explain  Ollie like Stone Cold Steve Austin  up folks Ollie or observability is like  having an x-ray vision for your computer  systems you know the ability to see  what's going on under the hood so to  speak it's all about collection  analyzing and displaying the metrics  traces and logs for your systems so  pretty funny pretty pretty similar  how about explaining like Snoop Dogg  yo check it out observability Ollie is  not like having an inside scoop on  what's happening with your computer  systems dog so pretty funny little humor  here  yeah  so pretty impressive what do you think  about this Ed this is awesome I love  this and I just it not only is just  useful but it's also I think it's a lot  of fun and just and I think think about  down the road the ability to  mimic a well-known person the ability to  try to mimic and what they're saying how  they say it is only going to get better  it's going to get increasingly hard to  distinguish between the machines and  people over time  couldn't agree more  and this also is where the Deep fakes  come in it's going to get even more  pervasive  and the big thing that I'm kind of  seeing the trend where I didn't see  things going is this is going to  exponentially get better so we may be  familiar with uh  say linear growth of different systems  where I feel like this is going to get  exponentially better over time so even a  year from now we're going to see  significantly improved capabilities from  this  oh yeah it's exciting and I think that's  the whole point about it's going to be  able to learn and grow and especially I  think with Microsoft's recent investment  it's it's gonna it's gonna accelerate  even more Yep absolutely think about all  the different ways you could use this I  mean let's think about just in our  narrow area in Tech and I.T AI support  assistance so you have a user  something's not working they're able to  go because we've all seen the chat Bots  and user assistance systems and then  generally they kind of suck and so if a  user can say hey I can't get on the VPN  and then to have intuitive detailed  information coming out from something  like chat GPT to help a user get through  the VPN issues without having to engage  a real person is a is a real scalable  valuable a valuable piece of assistance  and what we were talking about with  small queries observability queries uh  even SQL it's something that everyone  struggles with yeah you you want people  to use data systems but training users  and how to query query Data Systems and  get good results is not easy it's a huge  drain on on your on your engineering  teams so this is a way to to scale  augment your engineering teams and help  your users get better results from their  data couldn't agree more and that in of  itself is a scale that takes a long time  to a long time to learn is writing good  Splunk queries write a good SQL queries  and kind of learning the language and  how to make it efficient so that kind of  dives into the next topic here so how  can we use Chachi PT to write a sales  form query so say if I'm a new user  coming in I've never heard a Splunk but  I'm placed into this job and say as a  security engineer I need to get  information but I'm not really that  familiar with Splunk luckily I got chat  GPT available so the next question I'm  going to ask it is write me a Splunk  query which will look at our firewall  data  and show me the count between sorts IP  and test IP  by time  in addition  um give me a one Min span of time  okay  and just for the uninitiated that's a  super common query  um I've watched  um Farwell Engineers struggle to to use  these queries to innovate in these  queries for years and so having having  something that's going to help users and  this is something I hope to see in in  these total tools where you have a  window that pops out where you can ask  these kind of questions and you can get  and get these kind of results  exactly and time and time again being on  the Splunk team we always get questions  of how do I write this query why isn't  this query working  very simple query obviously you may have  a different index than just firewall  using a sub out and replace it but for  the most part it's using the bucket  command it's binning by time with one  minute spans it's then doing a stats  count by Source IP desk IP and time and  it's got that one minute uh one minute  span and it's clearly explaining what  it's doing pretty impressive this is  great this is great and the thing is it  doesn't have to be something super  complicated or something perfect just  just be able to help users with common  queries and get better results because  you and I both seen it where you'll have  a firewall firewall engineer so index  equals firewall and then have an IP and  that's it and then they wonder why it  takes you know hours to run the query  because it's just a it's a terrible  query exactly  with this too  yeah indeed and one thing that you just  brought up there Ed was it could be  extremely slow so a lot of you who are  familiar with looking at firewall data  it is very large and it's High Velocity  so how can we do this a bit more  efficiently than just looking at all of  our firewall data so let's go ahead and  see if we can speed this thing up so how  can I accelerate this search  and notice how I'm not referencing the  actual search by giving an example of  what the search is it's persisting the  the conversation that we're having and  so it's giving me some examples now on  how to increase that the speed of that  search so it's recommending that I use  index fields  um optimizing the search string using  the earliest and latest to try to be as  explicit as possible  using the limit command summary indexing  good strategy uh probably the answer I  was looking for here was using  acceleration  it number seven is a no-go I mean this  is something we need to be able to give  give uh chappy T feedback of uh no  exactly great great catch there Ed so  yeah there it is still a little clunky  in some use cases to where this is the  big No-No especially in firewall data  I wish my Alexa would be able to persist  a conversation like this that would be  nice yeah no doubt No Doubt so pretty  cool pretty cool and what it can do but  clearly there's still a few bugs that I  personally think will be worked out over  the next couple months as this thing  starts to evolve more  yeah I think the level investment in  open AI like just what we just mentioned  with Microsoft also just the more users  the more people who bang on it the more  people who add data is going to  exponentially grow it I'm just I'm  curious about the resources to support  this I mean that's just it's it's going  to get interesting fast and of course  the competitors I mean you look at this  is this Microsoft's attempt to displace  Google long term and of course Google  already owns phenomenal compute  resources and data resources data  scientists and so I think this this is  going to lead to just an enormous amount  of competition which is going to be  really good long term oh yeah couldn't  agree more  yeah so moving on now now we just  discovered that it can create queries  for us what about troubleshooting  queries so if a user is good enough or  dangerous enough to create their own  queries right when we have a  troubleshoot queries  holiday just for good measure but highly  likely to be able to figure out what I'm  talking about so we'll say index equals  summary Source type equals stash  stats span equals one H Max count  by time  now while I load this let me tell you  what the two issues are in this query  and see if chat CPT can find it so  number one we're using the stats with  the span equals one H this is dedicated  only to time charts so it should be time  chart span equals one H not stats if we  were to use stats and wanted to look at  our spans of time it should be bin we  want to bend our time with the stats  command next up is we're doing a Max  count we don't have a field defined as  count already so we're doing Max against  a field that doesn't exist looking at  what chat GPT says the field name count  is not specified in Max count exactly  what I just said so make sure that the  field name that you're trying to  calculate the maximum value for exists  in your data perfect exactly as expected  here next up sax let's see pretty much  says what number one said  so not not precisely what I was looking  for well  yeah not precisely what I was looking  for let's see if we can get it to  clarify a bit so  um let's say it's really close I mean it  identifies something I see users do all  the time  what about the span  the common thing I see is users passing  around queries and and some one user  will Define to find a query with a field  and they'll try to reuse that same query  and data and they don't get a result  because the Field's not there mm-hmm  bingo  and so looking at this long explanation  let me just highlight the important part  here so however it is worth noting that  when you use the stats command with span  argument it performs a time-based event  grouping and it doesn't group the events  based on time but instead uses the time  values  so this case it doesn't quite look like  it caught that aspect of it I've used  different versions of this queer before  and it was able to pick it up looks like  this case it was not so strike strike  two against the chat EPT it was close it  gave me a couple good suggestions so  like I said it's pretty good it's got a  little bit of room for improvement  though  one thing I'd be interested is I think a  lot of companies want to use something  like this but they're not you know and I  think this is something people should  should understand if you're taking a  script that you wrote for your company  and you put it in a chat GPT because  your script has now become public domain  and so yeah I think I think that those  are things that people have to keep in  mind when they're using this even though  there's so much value I think long term  there's going to have to be some way to  Shield chat GPT or Shield the public  especially with Engineers using  proprietary information  yep yep that's a great Point Ed  so next up on the list let's have it do  some regex for us so we got some sample  data here this is too cool I mean I'm  just like I I just I'm flabbergasted  because I'm not good at regex so having  something that would help me write  better rejects like wow  foreign  so what I'm asking you to do is create a  regular expression which will extract  the value before the at sign and create  the capture value with the name of name  in the sample data  below  alrighty let me go ahead and copy that  code and let's plug it in and see if it  worked  and let's see yeah  let's uh let's see if we can get this  thing to clean it up a bit  uh uh let's see  we gotta wait for it to finish  so it just went through an update  yesterday so it was working that was  working prior to that update a couple  things may have changed so let's see if  we can try to work the answer out of  chat CPT  so let's say  create a regular expression for the  sample data below  extract the value before the at sign  with  a capture group  called  email how about that  grab that sample data  right let's try that again  ah no same looks like he gave me the  same regex we'll try one more time and  if you can't get this we'll move on all  right so  create a regular uh actually I'm gonna  just have it persist so  uh rejects did not work  give me  a copy that will give me  expression  that will work correctly  oh and that reminds me so is this a  query language or is this natural  language or what are the boundaries  around how you can ask chat GPT  questions  yeah so this is using NLP or natural  language processing and this is looking  what I what basically taking the input  of what I'm giving it and it's comparing  it so at a high level the way this is  working it's leveraging what they call  the DaVinci model so there's a few  different models that you can play with  in the playground uh The DaVinci model  being the best one available they have  the Atta model they have uh  I can't remember what the other one's  called I think it's the cut the cutter  model I think it's the other one they're  all pretty good but the you're going to  have the most success in The DaVinci  model one thing to keep in mind with the  DaVinci model is it was trained on all  data all the way up until I think 2019  or 2020 something around there so it  doesn't have any context of uh  it doesn't have any contacts post that  but if we think of how chat GPT works it  was trained on the context of language  so it has the ability to logic and  reason and deduce uh different outcomes  based off types of questions that you  ask it  all right let's try this again  there we go  so looks like that regular expression  did work a little could have been a  little better but it's not too bad  um give me one moment I need to plug my  laptop in  well Steve Step It Away really  appreciate everyone's time this is so  exciting to take take a look at what's  going on and and just and everyone's  talking about chat GPT so we just want  to kind of go go in depth about what we  can do well what we can do what makes  sense and in Practical use cases for you  know everyday engineers and architects  all right  got it okay I'm back here we go yep so a  lot of people could could definitely  leverage this custom red decks Builder  too so I've used it in a lot of  scenarios and it's pretty good uh you  like I said from the previous example  you may have to get it to try a few more  times but what was really cool about  this is I told it that regex did not  work give me an expression that will  actually work and it even apologized to  me and gave me the correct expression  nice  with an explanation of what it's doing  pretty cool  it's still right it is think about you  so it's being trained at all the  information up from 2019. it's a lot of  information  the compute capacity to do this is just  it's like wow indeed  so what if we want to get a little more  complex now what if we wanted to move  away from writing queries to writing  scripts so another powerful tool in its  Arsenal is uh a lot of times me  personally on the job I gotta write  scripts for to do certain things uh  automation jobs to make my life easier  down the road so how can we leverage  chat GPT to write scripts for us so  let's go ahead and uh create something  really simple let's say a calculator in  Python so if I need to write some logic  so write a calculator  then the python  language  but this is going to create a script for  me which is going to uh give me all of  the the logic needed to make this thing  actually work and after it creates that  code for me it's then going to give me a  really detailed explanation of how it  works that way I can make tweets to it  myself it can make tweaks to it if I'm  not happy with it or if I want to extend  the functionality behind it best thing  about this this would take me quite a  while to to make  and it would take me also longer I in my  opinion to try to find the code on  Google  as opposed to just asking chat GP to  make it for me custom and if we walk  through it it looks like uh what we have  looks pretty good and looking at the  explanation here it I'm not going to  read this in its entirety but  um if we want it to elaborate more  explain more on how this script works  this is going to give me a super  detailed explanation as to what's  happening it talks about loops it gives  me uh the different uh functions it's  creating  and so super cool on how this thing can  really make your life easier with  creating scripts writing code  troubleshooting code uh making it more  efficient uh refactoring your code it  can do a really impressive things  and I agree with you I think especially  it doesn't necessarily have to be  correct but if you have a quality  starting point I think that can help  help bootstrap what you're doing a lot  faster  oh yeah  all right  so moving on from this example now we're  going to dive into our next example now  and we're going to get on onto the  example of troubleshooting so one of the  most common use cases that I'm always  getting asked is  um from a swamp perspective at least or  why did my logs stop flowing what  happened to my log files why aren't they  working I get to ask this question all  the time so now diving into the personal  assistant uh for for aiding on your  troubleshooting really cool on some of  the suggestions it can give so if we  were to ask it why did my long long stop  very generic we probably need to  elaborate a bit more but we're going to  ask it a super broad question just to  see if we can get a um some explanations  as to why did my Splunk log stop  I I can't tell you how many times it got  pulled into the bridge saying splunk's  broken and it's just like okay you know  let's let's let's let's let's let's  let's dive down into what this could be  and I I just think that I mean just for  the unskilled the beginning user there's  a lot of value here but also for highly  technical experienced Engineers because  maintaining your focus on the right  things being methodical and I think  that's something that chat GPT could  just could help drive so much value  oh yeah okay I I absolutely agree and so  it gives you make it repeatable too I  mean I think that repeatability is key  because you you can you can't always  have your best people on the phone  exactly you need your best Engineers  doing plan work and adding value not  troubleshooting problems  exactly  so we look at what was given here seven  different bullet points so indexer  issues forwarder issues and input  configuration issues and uh Etc this one  down here is probably the first thing I  would do as an experienced engineer  um always look at your logs what are  your logs telling you what's going on so  let's see if we can have it elaborate a  bit more so troubleshoot your logging  system is to check your logs yep that's  the best way of going about it so I'm  going to say how do I check the logs  what do I do  and so this is going to give me a few  examples absolutely number one you want  to do check your monitoring console this  tells you even how to get to your  monitoring console  next up command line interface go take a  look on the uh on the Shelf see what's  going on go tail your file what file do  I tell  uh let's see did it tell us to look at  Splunk D that's the one in particular  that we're looking for an answer here  there it is  this is the location of our Splunk D  file which is our Splunk home Ops Splunk  varlog Splunk splunky dialogue that's  the one and that's the key place to  start too  so  what if I don't have shell access  how can I look at splunkfeed.log  in the UI  almost getting it right it needs to be  looking at underscore internal though  that's precisely what I'm trying to get  from it right now yo  because that's always that's always the  key thing that if you have the right  access you know you may not know that  there we go  not as explicit as I'd like it to be so  it's kind of going in the right  direction here but right  can you give chat PT feedback and say  you know you need to do this this and  this oh yeah that's exactly what they're  looking for so right now chappy chat  gpts and uh what they call their beta  phase so it's free it's open everyone  can use it and they're primarily looking  for feedback on how to make this better  so down the road it's going to cost  money to use it but luckily it's Dirt  Cheap to use so I think they use tokens  based off price so  um if we were to look at cost it also  depends on what type of model that  you're using so coming back to that  DaVinci model that I spoke about prior I  think the cost for using the DaVinci  model was something around like two  tenths of a cent per uh I think a  thousand tokens which a thousand tokens  is equivalent to around 750 word  response back so it'd cost you about a  one-fifth of a cent to get a 750 word  response back roughly I mean what a  business model for something like this  it's just you're irritating the cash  register every second of every day  yeah oh yeah  so  let me give you some feedback now so  ideally I wanted to see the output  include the source type equal to splunky  against the internal logs  there's some feedback I'm giving it  does it help to give it something like  index equals underscore internal or  something like that  yeah it understands it it knows where to  look from it's just being a little goofy  right now and acting up so I had to kind  of lead it that direction so it's  definitely not as good as an experienced  engineer but where where you can see a  lot of benefits to this is if you start  feeding it some of your knowledge so  clearly you can't  well you shouldn't give it any type of  internal sensitive information from your  organization assuming if you could  though you can include some of that  sensitive information well not sensitive  but some of that internal information  into the uh into the prompt that you're  asking it and it could go through and  basically you create like an if  statement or you feed it some examples  and then it can go through your logic  and deduce the correct answer out of  that  totally and I think that's a big thing  as it evolves I bet you there's going to  be some way to constrain learned  internal information  oh yeah that's definitely coming so  let's dive into our last topic here so  evaluating other tools and kind of  getting quick ideas of what's on the  market  so as an architect uh we do a lot of  work of evaluating new tools in the  market who the players are  um as a lot of you probably know things  are evolving very fast in the technical  landscape  um so you got to be on top of your game  what what what tools are adding value  what tools can you do cheaper and more  effectively and how can you reduce some  of that tool sprawl so let's go ahead  and see if we can ask how to get that  done so let's go ahead and say What are  the  pulls on the market today  this'll be a long list  oh yeah let's see if it'll give us let's  see if it'll give us like a top three  top five or give us all  yep  so Prometheus number one  gives me a little uh description about  it open source grafana open source I  love how they include the description  Zipkin  data dog  entering the data dogs the first first  really commercial one  New Relic yeah  what if we were to let's see what if we  were to slightly change this question to  say What are the  observability  pipeline tools that supplement a tool  like swamp  today or we can say or  it's a better dog  yep  all right we got fluent D pretty common  one yeah not really a pipeline but yeah  whatever Kafka no  there's one in particular that I'm  looking for and I'm trying to shake it  out of it shake it out yeah  yeah I have to change at GPT yeah what's  going on here chat EPT yeah I know what  about credible  there you go  adbot  and I can't I can't there we go there's  a new input until uh this is finished  okay so they're calling it log streaming  not data not not observability pipeline  that's why because the DaVinci model  uses data all the way up till 2019 so  it's a bit still  there you go  if you if you spelled out observability  pipeline would it make a difference  let's take a look or would it equate  Ollie with observability  yeah it definitely equates the ollie to  observability  let's see what let's see let's use their  terminology and what cribble was branded  back in uh prior to 2019. it was just  crippled and it wasn't observability  pipeline either that observability  pipeline I think was 2020.  what are tools for log data streaming  that are commercial  do not include open source  not a lot you know that's a Sim  that's not log data streaming  it's eight you know analytics nope not  log B Distributing either  another bad bot mm-hmm  yeah these are sims not logged into  streaming so this is an example it's  it's misclassified the data  you make me sad  once it's done with this response let's  go ahead and uh  see what it says  and it apologize  [Laughter]  that's awesome  yep you gotta love it it's too funny  yeah so that so like we said there's no  magic bullet here it's very good in what  it can do it's still got a little bit  ways to go but in terms of assisting  troubleshooting explaining Concepts  writing code fixing queries  um it's pretty impressive in terms of  where it is now I'm thinking in the  coming years we're going to see rapid  expansion a lot more use cases coming  online uh we're gonna see how much  higher sophistication specifically  around uh how much data is Gen being  generated uh year over year it's just  exploding so more data that's available  for this thing to learn on the better  it's going to get and I really think the  biggest takeaway here is you can't rely  on this thing to replace humans or  Engineers or Architects doing their job  this is a a supplement as to how to make  Engineers better how to extend  functionality how to increase efficiency  of Engineers this needs to be thought of  as using in a top-down way rather than  bottom up top down in terms of give me  examples as give me a starting point  give me uh give me some examples to work  from rather than build this for me  implement it and then I don't have to do  anything  can't think of it that way  yeah I totally agree I think in terms of  supplementing there's a lot of tools  here especially in the I.T side support  Level One support  troubleshooting I mean there's just  there's so many good use cases so this  is something maybe not ready right now  but it will be soon I just you we'd be  both in on too many bridges where I  think having this thing is focused  instead of having a you know an Incident  Commander it may not necessarily  understand what to do I think chappy GPT  you could be a good instant Commander  about stepping through the process  stepping through the steps follow up I  mean there's there's a lot of good  things here oh yeah  well Steve I really appreciate it let's  have just a quick summation just just as  a follow-up so I'm gonna go ahead and  and take it take out the live stream  let's go ahead and put just our you know  so we talked about summarizing  unfamiliar topics great great way to  learn  better faster results from script  scripts and queries troubleshooting  assistance faster new tool evaluation I  think there's just there's great stuff  here so I really appreciate it to tell  me what what do you think the future is  going to hold for check for chappy GPT  and equivalent tools yeah so if you  would have asked me this question a year  from a year ago I would have told you AI  is far enough out to where we don't have  to worry about it in terms of uh some of  the scarier capabilities I feel like  seeing seeing how this operates now I  see a lot of use cases I I do see a lot  of Nefarious actions that could be taken  with it uh luckily chat GPT is what they  call ethical well to a certain extent to  where if you ask it to do specific  things if you want to have it write bad  code for you malicious code it won't do  it so luckily for that aspect there are  some ethical boundaries in place for it  um thinking about just different future  use cases inside companies I think it's  going to be great at advancing  capabilities much faster than what would  have happened without it I think over  the next couple years we're going to  start seeing uh really revolutionary  ideas coming so  uh more more in the thought more on the  aspect of lowering your mttr finding  incidents reducing incidents at a much  rapid rapid speed we're going to see  more up times across companies and I  think from a security perspective this  is going to be a really good tool in the  Arsenal of uh investigating uh security  incidents and also trying to keep your  environment uh trying to keep the bad  actors out of your environment  I think long term I want to be able to  see chappie gbt interface with our Tools  in order to say hey it's like hey I'm  doing this you know run this query for  me in the background and give me the  results and I think those are the kind  of things I think that could be really  really helpful in the engineering and  architecture side  yep absolutely this is really cool Steve  I want to thank you for your time I  really appreciate it I'm going to have  you back on the live stream really soon  right on hey thanks for having me Ed  all right take care alrighty thank you  bye
