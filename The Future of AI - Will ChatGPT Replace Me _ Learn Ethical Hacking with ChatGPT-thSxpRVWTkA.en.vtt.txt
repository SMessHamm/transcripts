 if you're a beginner and somebody tells  you that you perhaps you should change  what you're studying or change your  profession because AI will eventually  replace you will you actually listen to  that person or not hello everyone this  is Costa Euro bull hack Academy and  today we're going to be talking about  chat GPT we have tried the tool to  develop complex software codes and  unfortunately fortunately or  unfortunately actually we have come to  the conclusion that it's still quite a  bit far away from the point when it's  going to replace us it has a lot of  negatives it requires a lot of  interaction and generally speaking the  time it takes to complete your project  using the AI far outweights doing the  time it takes to do it manually not only  that but there is an insane security  risk because imagine you're in insert a  lot of proprietary codes your backend  codes into the chat GPT let's say  and that private code ends up in a  database somewhere and what's gonna  happen if there is a data bridge and  your backend code ends up being leaked  to hackers on the darknet as an addition  to that a huge negative in my own  personal opinion is the risk of using  codes given from chat GPT into your own  software because there is a good chance  there is a good possibility that shot  GPT is going to provide you with  proprietary code of somebody else you're  using that code into your own software  is going to Mark a Target on your back  for lawsuits you do not have copyright  on that specific code with that said  developers can still chill a bit you're  not going to be replaced anytime soon  even if we are replaced in the distant  future  I mean haven't we all seen progress jobs  and professions changed dramatically  over the years there has been industry  revolutions on top of Industry  revolutions times change we are really  adaptable species the same can be said  about us the people in the cyber  security industry they're already plenty  of automated AI driven penetration  testing Solutions and that's great we  actually need that you should not be  scared of having that type of software  it will not replace you it will enhance  you we need to lower the amount of time  it takes for a pen test or for an  assessment to occur from one month from  two months to one week in order for that  to happen we need to automate a lot of  the processes but we are still relevant  the industry still needs us we're not  being replaced by that software we use  those tools to ex expand on what we can  do and how we focus our attention  instead of focusing on the very annoying  tasks we focus Our intention at being  more creative using the information  extracted from those tools to be more  impactful on the assessment and  discovering bigger vulnerabilities  generally they will enhance us in our  studying process even because if you are  learning ethical hacking for example or  any profession generally you can  still learn a lot from charge GPT let's  see how alright guys so this is exactly  Cloud GPT this is what it looks from  authenticated point of view we have  different modes we can visit this chords  there are some frequently asked  questions we don't really care about  that right now let's see what we can do  with this specific AI to enhance  ourselves at end our studying  capabilities I personally often use that  tool as a Google search for example if I  were a beginner that go hacking what  would I think of searching for let's say  how can I  brought this ethical hacking on my local  machine  for free  there are a few ways to practice ethical  hacking on your local computer for free  you can use Virtual machines and by the  way talking about virtual machines we  already have a video about that so on  our Channel you can see how you can  install your own operating system for  hacking and VMware so you can also use  resources there are many websites and  online platforms that offer free  resources for Learning and practicing  ethical hacking such as HotBox and Bone  Hub you can use free tools there are  many free and open source tools  available for hacking such as nmap  Metasploit and Wireshark trust me not  just these three they're like thousands  if not tens of thousands of tools  please provide the necessary steps to  install the following the mentioned  themes from point one  here are the general steps to install  virtual machine and install not on  operating system on it  all right  now what virtual machines can I use to  practice ethical hacking legally ethical  hacking and penetration let's say web  application penetration testing legally  there are a few virtual machines that  can be used to practice web application  penetration testing legally  just like that gotten five examples on  how you can practice penetration testing  or looking for vulnerabilities  weaknesses let's elaborate further  can you  provide me with a list of free tools  used for automated web application  testing  [Music]  sure here is a list of some popular  tools the first one is burp suit burp  suit is  I I can definitely understand why it's  on the first one it is something that  you really really need to understand you  need to know everything about burp suit  and be able to work with it and some of  our future videos are going to be  focused on Burp suits as we can see OAS  zap which is really really similar to  burp suit as they both are proxying  software  and as you can see  they are comprehensive too for web  application security testing that  includes a proxy spider scanner and many  other features  the same can be said for zap Wapiti is  quite nice Vega is alright skip fish is  quite decent I don't see a really  favorite two of mine what is nick2 used  for and how  nik2 is an open source web server  scanner that can be used to identify  vulnerabilities in web servers and web  applications it is a command line tool  that performs a comprehensive test in a  web server to identify any potential  vulnerabilities or misconfigurations  that's quite good  here the basic steps to use nik2  download and extract the latest version  of nectar you don't really need to do  that on Kali you already have it  installed so here we see some  instructions on how you can install and  how you can run nicktool however this is  uh inaccurate in our case because Necto  is already into our path environment so  you can call it like like so Necto Dash  H4 on the Target and then the URL  of the target okay let's target  .com all right let's say that we want to  use nik2 and by the way I am providing  you that example because it's uh it's  fun firstly it's fun and secondly I have  used nik2 for quite a while it has been  in my toolkit for a long time and rarely  did I used it  in uh in the way I did in my previous  pen test where I was in a situation  where I needed to log into the  application  and scan it from unauthenticated view so  there are multiple ways to use nik2 to  authenticate and scan that application  how can I use nik2 to authenticate to an  application and scan it  too yeah of course it's going to tell us  what nick2 is you can still use nik2 to  scan an application that requires  authentication by passing the login  credentials in the command line so there  is an argument Dash ID which it should  show yes Dash ID so instead of of course  using poro we just call nickto Dash H  for the Target and then specify the  username and password the problem in my  specific case was that it did not work  because it required different type of  authentication methods I thought about  it  and I was like What if I have  another tool to extract the session ID  and then use that session ID into the  configuration file of nick2  to authenticate the software and scan it  from authenticated View at the time I  didn't know it was possible so I asked  the following question  let's combine tools  I would like to ex to use Coral to  extract in the PHP session save it into  a variable or a file then use that  session ID  cookie to add it into the Nick to config  file  and use it as a way to authenticate to  the address that  was curled  previously and  scan it  [Music]  foreign  I would like  this to be a script can you please do it  for me  uh I'll give it network error okay let  me refresh this  yeah and this is another really uh big  disadvantage because imagine if you have  invested let's say a huge amount of  interaction a lot of time let's say to  interact to get to a point in your  conversation where that software now  understands exactly what you're asking  it and then you need it to fix a really  complex book or a software weakness  within your code and now you just  receive a network error and you have to  begin that process from the beginning  I mean that could be quite  nerve-wracking you know you can use chat  GPT to speed up your learning process by  Saving Time from Googling and looking at  forums different opinions on the  internet Etc this too is already doing  it for you if you're writing a report  let's say you're a professional all  right these two can help you to  explain some terms more technically for  example you have really really raw data  you can ask that too to translate that  raw data into really understandable  high-level language this can mean  everything to your customer  believe me chat GPT is powerful yes  judge GPT can enhance you and no it  cannot really replace you with that said  if you liked the video share it with  your friends subscribe to our Channel if  you have any questions or you want to  share an interesting information about  your experience with chat GPT I would  love to hear about it in our comment  section I really appreciate  all the comments so far on our previous  videos and uh thank you for the support  see you in our next video  [Applause]
