 write me a script for a video about  Microsoft's new AI powered Bing  interface  welcome to this video where we will show  you how Microsoft's new AI powered Bing  interface can make your online search  experience faster smarter and more  personalized okay well I guess my work  here is done I'll I'll let Bing take  over from now  [Music]  I'll save you the time what you've just  seen is Microsoft's new AI powered  version of Bing that's here to take on  Google search dominance Microsoft is now  bringing a Next Generation GPT model to  its beam search engine that is confident  will transform search as we know it  today so why is this different to chat  GPT and what's new  first up Microsoft is putting answers to  queries side by side with the search  results you're used to seeing today  they're called chat answers and it's the  type of response you'd find in chat GPT  you'll get the usual links followed by  more conversational response at the side  that's neat and it will ease people  gently into this new AI powered search  but it's the chat interface that's  really interesting chat GPT has wowed  the web with its impressive ability to  naturally respond to queries write poems  organize people's lives and much more  Bing's AI features are based on a more  advanced version of what powers chat GPT  that means it can do things like surface  breaking news and relevant information  as it's happening and it can also do  stuff like organize a free day vacation  to New York City for you and your family  when it's warm  the main chat interface is very similar  to chat GPT but it searches news sources  with surprising speed for events that  are unfolding or that have just happened  this is all super Speedy but much like  chat GPT it's not always accurate  earlier today I asked it about a bunch  of queries and one of them was related  to a breaking news incident and it gave  me the date for tomorrow instead of  today but it's not just music can cover  and search queries Microsoft says it's  AI powered Bing should be better at  writing code than chat GPT I'm not a  coder so I'll leave that up to the  prompt engineering experts to really  test Microsoft's promises there the big  differences can be found in how  Microsoft has integrated these chatbot  Powers into its edge browser and I think  this is where the future of Microsoft's  open AI partnership gets really  interesting Edge now has a sidebar which  can scan entire web pages and allow you  to pick out information or run chat  queries against websites now imagine  you're on Amazon and searching for a TV  you could ask Bing to compare the best  4K TVs find the best price and then  formulate this all into a neat table  that you can email to your partner  there's even a compose tab that makes  all the work of typing in parameters a  little bit easier offering a GUI for  tone format and length you can ask  Bing's AI model to write about anything  here and it will neatly format it and  get it ready for a blog post an email or  just a simple list Microsoft didn't talk  about this on stage today but you  couldn't imagine a future where word or  Outlook could just generate in documents  or emails for you automatically you  could technically do this right now just  open up a web-based version of Word put  it alongside this little sidebar and  Edge and in this generating content for  you on the Fly here's the resignation  layer I just created for my boss to say  I'm resigning because AIO is replacing  my job  foreign  all of these new features look great and  the possibilities are almost endless but  there will be thousands of people out  there looking to break this new Bing AI  much in the same way as people jailbreak  chat gbt and make it say bad things  Microsoft says here has some additional  safeguards in place to protect against  this but we'll see how long it takes for  the prompt Engineers to break past it  will also be interesting to see how  Publishers and content owners react to  this the chat answers are more advanced  than the simple query answers that we  see in search engines today and it's  clear that people will click on links  less even if Bing is clearly sourcing  information here Microsoft is going to  open up a whole bunch of conversations  around content regulatory risks legal  issues and much more we've already seen  Getty suing some image generation  companies and we're just at the  beginning of how this type of AI will  reshape online content overshadowing all  of this is Google and exactly how the  search giant will respond Microsoft is  clearly trying to take away search  engine market share from Google and make  being more relevant Neil I sat down with  Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella for the  decoder podcast we have the full  interview up on the channel but here's  what he had to say first of all I mean  look I have the greatest of admirations  uh for Google and what they've done and  you know they're they're an unbelievable  company with great talent and you know  and I have a lot of respect for Sundar  and his teams they have the 800 pound  gorilla on this which is uh what they  are and I hope that with our Innovation  um they will definitely want to come out  and show that they can dance and I want  people to know that we made them dance  and I think that'll be a great day and  Google is going to be dancing real soon  just a day before Microsoft Event Google  announces chat GPT competitor Bard it's  in limited testing right now and we  haven't seen exactly how it handles  queries or how Google attempt to  integrate it into search but it's clear  the AI search battle is on if you  thought chat GPT was interesting things  are about to shift up a gear like I said  earlier the full satinadillo interviews  up on the channel so go check that out  but if we're going to end this the way  that Bing wanted us to thanks for  watching and happy searching
