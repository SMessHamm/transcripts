 foreign  [Music]  what's up guys and welcome back to Wall  Street Millennial on this channel we  cover everything related to stocks and  investing on November 30th 2022 a new  ai-powered chat bot called chat GPT took  the World by storm garnering more than 1  million users within the first week of  launch it's a free to use online tool  which can create text outputs based on  prompts you give it and you can ask it  to create pretty much anything you want  here it is making a Shakespearean sonnet  about hamburgers while chat GPT was only  released recently the technology behind  it has been in the works for years by  the company open AI open AI was founded  as a non-profit organization in 2015 by  a Consortium of donors including Elon  Musk the idea behind the Venture was to  research ways to develop artificial  intelligence responsibly in a way that  would provide the most benefit for  Humanity given the tremendous success of  his AI creation you'd expect musk to be  happy but this is not the case shortly  after musk took over as CEO of Twitter  he banned openai from accessing the  company's database of tweets even going  back to 2020 musk has been openly  criticizing the company on Twitter  saying that open AI is no longer open  and has been captured by Microsoft so  what is going on why is musk so critical  of an organization that he co-founded  while musk co-founded open AI he has not  been operationally involved with them  since he stepped down from the  organization's board of directors in  2018. openai received a one billion  dollar investment from Microsoft to  develop new AI technology that Microsoft  will commercialize but how is this  possible openai was a non-profit  organization how could they receive a  one billion dollar investment from  Microsoft which is for profit the key is  that openai was a non-profit  organization in the past tense before  securing the investment from Microsoft  open AI transitioned from a non-profit  organization to a capped profit  organization which is a corporate  structure that they invent  the idea is that investors are allowed  to receive some return on investment but  this will be capped at some  predetermined limit any profit beyond  the limit will go to funding open ai's  mission to responsibly develop AI to  benefit Humanity at first this sounds  like a good compromise private  investment will give openai the capital  and needs to continue developing its  technology while allowing it to maintain  its original Mission but when you look  at the details it's not a compromise at  all the returns for the first round of  investors is capped at 100 times their  original investment this means that they  will have to generate 100 billion  dollars of profit to pay back Microsoft  with such a high rate of return the cap  is basically a farce and open AI is no  different from any other for-profit  company Microsoft has already started  selling chat gpt's technology to  Enterprise customers on its Azure cloud  computing platform it appears to be  working out pretty well for them as they  are reportedly and talks to pump even  more money into the formerly non-profit  organization musk has long feared the  danger that artificial intelligence  could pose to humanity once computers  become smarter than people  he created openai as a non-profit  focused on maximizing the benefit and  safety of humanity not maximizing profit  but open AI almost immediately abandoned  their non-profit status in the pursuit  of money  while chat GPT may look like a harmless  party gimmick today it as well as other  technologies that openai is rolling out  have the potential to drastically  reshape our economy and Society in this  video we'll look at how Microsoft was  able to effectively use serp control of  open Ai and why Elon Musk is so worried  about it  open AI was founded in 2015 by Elon Musk  CEO of Tesla Sam Altman the former  president of the Venture Capital firm y  combinator as well as a few other  wealthy technologists here's an  interview with Musk from 2016 talking  about open ai's Mission shortly after it  was founded  the best of the available alternatives  that I can come up with and maybe  somebody else can come up with a better  approach a better outcome is that we  achieve democratization of AI technology  meaning that no one company or a small  set of individuals has control over  Advanced AI technology I think that  that's very dangerous  it's not just I think that the risk is  that the AI would develop all of its own  right off the bat I think it's more  that's the concern is that some someone  um may use it in a way that is bad  or and even if they weren't going to use  it in a way that's bad that somebody  could take it from them and use it in a  way that's bad  that that I think is quite a big danger  so I think we must have democratization  of AI technology and make it widely  available  um and that's you know the reason that  obviously uh you mean the rest of the  team you know created openai  um was to help uh with the democrators  help help spread out AI technology so it  doesn't get concentrated in the hands of  a few  musk is a big believer in the power of  artificial intelligence to revolutionize  our economies and societies perhaps his  most important project at Tesla is the  development of autonomous vehicles which  rely on AI technology at the same time  he is very concerned about the dangers  that AI can pose to humanity if it ends  up in the wrong hands that's why he  co-founded openai as a non-profit  organization meant to democratize AI  technology and prevent it from being  controlled by any single entity it was  initially structured as a non-profit and  the founding donors poured in tens of  millions of dollars to get the  organization up and running because it  was a non-profit the original Founders  had no economic stake in the  organization and had no way of receiving  any profits from The Venture it was done  purely for altruistic reasons to promote  the responsible development of AI in a  way that would maximize the benefit and  minimize the risk to humanity Sam Oldman  became the CEO of open AI responsible  for day-to-day operations Elon Musk  already had his hands full being CEO of  Tesla and SpaceX so he sat on the board  of directors but had only limited  operational involvement  artificial intelligence is nothing new  the first Research into what could be  considered modern AI started at  Dartmouth University in the 1950s at its  core AI is defined by the perceiving  synthesizing and inferring of  information by machines AI has already  found real world applications for  example when you're scrolling through  your recommendation list on Netflix  there's an AI system on the back end  which decides which TV shows and movies  you're most likely to enjoy while  Netflix recommendations may not seem  revolutionary it would not be possible  without AI had it not been for AI they  would need to hire hundreds of thousands  of human workers to curate unique  recommendations lists for each Netflix  subscriber needless to say this would be  infeasible of course content  recommendations and other similar use  cases are a long way off in the types of  dystopian risks that musk is concerned  about this is because these more  primitive forms of AI were created to  fulfill a very specific task and have no  ability to do anything else long story  story short they are not creative openai  was trying to develop what they call  artificial general intelligence this  refers to a computer being able to do  any tasks that a human can do the first  thing that openai tried to develop was a  human-like natural language generator  which can understand and create  human-written language this would  eventually become chat GPT this  technology has the potential to replace  human customer service functions by  reading customer messages and responding  to them autonomously it would have the  potential to replace journalists and  other writers by being able to create  articles in other documents using AI for  an AI to gain human level intelligence  it has to learn from humans in the case  of open ai's chadbot they trained it by  scrolling through billions of web pages  on Wikipedia Twitter and other websites  the internet today contains millions of  times more information than any human  could ever remember but a computer can  save all this data almost Without Limits  but what's even more powerful is the  ai's ability to understand human speech  patterns by observing billions of  interactions between real people on the  internet the AI gains an understanding  of how humans communicate and can thus  replicate it  the problem is all of this costs a lot  of money in order to process the  billions of pages worth of data open AI  needs an army of supercomputers working  24 7. this would cost tens if not  hundreds of millions of dollars while  the company did have Rich donors  including Elon Musk there is a limit to  how much money they were willing to put  in with zero Prospect of ever making a  profit they received another blow in  2018 when Elon Musk stepped down from  the board of directors in fear of  potential conflicts of interest with the  automaker's own AI research while Elon  Musk was not able to provide the  adequate level of funding Microsoft was  in 2019 the tech giant announced a one  billion dollar Strategic investment into  open AI which included giving them  access to the super computing power on  Microsoft's Azure Cloud platform but  there was a catch Microsoft has a  fiduciary responsibility to maximize  shareholder value so they weren't giving  this money for free in order to receive  this investment from Microsoft openai  had to transition from a non-profit to a  so-called Capt profit organization but  as we discussed earlier this cap is a  100 times increase over the initial 1  billion dollar investment so the profit  cap is basically a farce openai is now a  for-profit company with Microsoft being  its largest shareholder and strategic  partner by far with a combination of  many years of research from open ai's  employees along with Microsoft's vast  supercomputer Network the company was  able to achieve multiple breakthroughs  in artificial general intelligence so  far this has culminated in three main  products firstly the AI chatbot chat GPT  secondly the AI image creation tool  Dolly 2 and finally codex which writes  computer code autonomously using Ai and  the results are extremely impressive as  a marketing gimmick openai has made both  chat GPT and Dali 2 available to the  public for free for now although we can  likely expect them to start charging  money for it in the near future with  Dolly 2 you can input whatever painting  you wanted to draw no matter how  ridiculous it may seem for example here  it has created an oil painting of a  sloth astronaut navigating the cosmos  within a few seconds this is something  that would take a skilled painter many  hours if not days to complete by hand  Chad gbt is perhaps even more impressive  here I gave it the annual revenue data  for Apple for the past decade and asked  it to create computer code to make an  animated line chart showing this in the  first iteration it worked but it wasn't  exactly like I wanted it did create an  animated line chart but the X and Y axes  adjusted with each frame in a way that  made it difficult to read this is where  the most impressive part about chat gbt  comes into play it remembers the  previous outputs that has given you so  you can tell it to make adjustments I  told to change the above code so that  both the X and Y axes are fixed it  rewrote the code to do just that and  created the final output that I wanted  here I was able to create this animated  line chart without needing to write a  single line of code on my own I only  used regular human language to tell it  what to do with this tool somebody with  zero coding experience can create things  they would not be able to do otherwise  chat GPT can also be used to write  articles and answer questions pretty  much whatever you ask it to do it can  give you an output that looks like it  could have been written by a human  however there is one major limitation  its training data only goes up to 2021  so it is not knowledgeable about current  events however this limitation will  likely be solved with the paid version  of the service which is expected to  launch soon  Microsoft is already starting to sell  open AI Based Services to its Enterprise  customers in conjunction with their  Azure cloud computing platform early use  cases include creating text for  marketing documents quickly reading  through and summarizing legal documents  responding to customer inquiries and  writing computer code just to name a few  the potential for disruption of this  technology is difficult to overstate  there are millions of people who work in  the journalism and copywriting  industries many simple writing tasks  such as email marketing materials could  be done with chat gpt's AI technology a  lot of journalistic Articles could be  written by AI as well software Engineers  could also see their jobs at risk codex  could serve as a force multiplier  allowing one engineer to write a  computer code that would previously have  required a team of 10 people  however from a societal perspective the  potential unemployment may be the least  of our concerns the thing that makes  chat GPT so powerful is the fact that  the computer generated output is  indistinguishable from that of a real  human but this also makes it incredibly  dangerous when you're reading an article  online or any piece of text for that  matter you may have no way of knowing if  it was written by a human or a computer  if you've ever looked into the abyss  that is the YouTube comments section  especially on crypto related videos  you're probably familiar with the  massive quantity of bots promoting  various crypto scams for the most part  these Bots are unsophisticated and it's  pretty easy to tell that it wasn't a  real human leaving each comment  however if the scammers could use tools  like chat gbt it may become far more  difficult to differentiate Bots from  humans companies could also use chat GPT  to generate fake hype for their products  on forums such as Reddit political and  ideological actors can create massive  amounts of propaganda articles to  manipulate public opinion Microsoft and  openai both claim that they'll put in  safeguards to prevent customers from  abusing this technology for deceptive  purposes Zuckerberg has been saying that  Facebook takes user privacy seriously  since at least 2005. what we can do with  that but we're obviously like really  sensitive to people's privacy  and we all know how that turned out in  the end there will always be a gray area  of what is acceptable and what is not as  a profit maximizing company Microsoft  has a duty to its shareholders to err on  the side of laying their customers do  whatever they want employees are  incentivized by performance-based  bonuses and career advancements  assigning deals with customers brings in  money agonizing over complicated ethical  questions does not Elon Musk knew this  could be a problem from the beginning in  fact this was his entire purpose of  founding openai as a non-profit this way  nobody would be forced to make the  difficult trade-offs between profit and  ethics that's why Elon Musk is so upset  open AI was started as open source and  non-profit neither are still true today  regardless of his original intentions  musk created a monster which he can no  longer control  all right guys that wraps it up for this  video what do you think about open AI  was it justified in turning into a  for-profit company let us know in the  comments section below as always thank  you so much for watching and we'll see  in the next one Wall Street Millennial  signing out
