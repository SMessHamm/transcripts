 so I'll be using chat GPT for a while  now since when I was introduced to it  about a week ago and here's my take on  it for those of you who don't know open  ai's new chat platform called chat GPT  it is a natural language processing  model based on generative pre-trained  Transformer GPT in other words think of  it as Google but with more human-like  features  but don't worry I've got some questions  for the AI and based on its response  we'll be able to get in-depth  understanding on what GPT is quick side  note I'm not going to go in in depth  about machine learning and complex  mathematics but rather I'm going to be  giving my take on the ai's response to  every single question so let's add a  Chase already so for the first question  today I I grabbed this fairly easy  calculus question online  and see how the AI is explaining the  step it is taken to solve the math  problem it's amazing how it's able to  solve and conclude with the constant C  well this is a little bit of NLP in a  nutshell you notice I was able to  understand the action integrate and  solve the problem accordingly and this  is what chat GPT is good at  but moving on to the next set of  questions I'll be explaining a little  more about chat GPT software and what  chat GPT is  so to proceed the AI was asked to write  a script introducing the following  characters talking about the future of  AI in the style of a Quentin Tarantino  movie the result was just mind-blowing  so let's just say chargpt was able to  create the dialogue between these three  people and also understand the text and  formats in which we wanted it to so with  leads us on to how GPT actually works so  like I mentioned earlier GPT stands for  generative pre-trained Transformer so  what this chart GPT actually does is  that its rate response in terms of human  validity and pick the one with the  highest rating as the best response so  think of it as this anytime you ask the  AI question it gives the response with  the highest human validity for example  in fact the AI what is a car it rates  the human validity of each and every  answer that I would give and picks the  one with the highest rating if writing  scripts or solving calculus is not  enough the AI is able to understand  emotions and relationships and can help  in the best way it can solve them so I  asked the AI for some help and here is  its response I'm sorry to hear that you  are feeling down it can be difficult to  keep going when it feels like your hard  work isn't paying off but it's important  to remember that success often requires  perseverance even if you don't see the  results you want right away continue to  work hard and stay focused on your goals  remember it's not always about the  destination but about the journey every  step you take every effort you make  brings you closer to achieving your  dreams so don't give up and keep pushing  forward  It Is by no doubt that this chat GPT  might be the future of AI communication  but let's look at how good the AI is at  telling history  just to mention it the AI is able to  organize information that it already has  and either summarize or explain in  detail the information that the AI has  on a particular topic is because the AI  cannot access information from September  2021 to date because it's a pre-trained  software it can only answer the  questions that we've been trained with  so let's see what I mean so if you ask  chargpt a question on any event in 2022  it serves you with this this makes it a  little unreliable when it comes to being  updated but I'm sure this can be fixed  in the near future and would be able to  access the internet so let's just say  you ask chargpt to write the history of  YouTube  it's very impressive no doubt the fact  that it is able to organize about all  the information in one place is just  what I'm looking for but there's one  feature that makes chat GPT as  human-like as you can get chat GPT makes  it so to accept Corrections on  information that it gives however it  does not update its information but it  must be noted that the AI sometimes give  incorrect answers and sometimes correct  yourself when you ask some time later  the AI can deny response to a particular  question but when asked in another way  it goes ahead and does it this is a  common problem with large language  models today but just so you know chart  GPT is in its developing stage and in  about a few years things will definitely  change for chat GPT  [Music]  thank you  [Music]
