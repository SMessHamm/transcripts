 tell her something more sexy no no no no  no no no no no no no no no no no yeah  like like more like uh and more sensual  you know anything that'll turn her on  subscribe to the podcast KFC radio on  YouTube Bang I don't watch I don't look  at Pop Culture stuff yeah right like if  somebody asked me like what's going on  with the Hubble or is it what's going on  with like the latest in like Alzheimer  research or what's going on the latest  in like AI or what's going on in the  latest I'm gonna know I'm gonna be aware  of that I don't know about pop culture  at all okay so that chat was it chat GPT  or whatever is that gonna be for real it  is in insanely it's not gonna replace it  like uh writers  okay can I do a funny podcast here's the  thing so  everybody was like predicting that  software was going to take everybody's  jobs and you know it was like  questionable like it helped people were  tools to help people work better  when the question comes about Ai and  whether or not it's going to replace  replace people  it's far more likely that it could  replace people and so we have to be  thoughtful about how we apply it but it  might change what people are good at  because right now you get a ton of  credit if you're good at coming up with  like the creative content or like the  quality of the writing or the quality of  the interview or the quality or whatever  it is I mean you could go on right now  and go and check GB Theory and go give  me 10 questions that I should ask Ashton  Kutcher in an interview you can do that  yeah and it'll pop out 10 questions that  are like legitimate decent questions  right yeah you did anything we've asked  them you can go and check how do you  know we don't use it you can go on chat  GP to three right now and say  who are the the 10 greatest Yankees of  all time and it'll pop out the tent  arguably the 10 greatest Yankees of all  time like it it will it it is that good  but knowing the prompt to give it is the  thing that how to use it you have you  you have knowing how to use it  effectively is the difference between  giving you an extraordinary answer and  giving you an answer that like you know  anybody can give me right right and so  so uh but yeah it's the real deal it's  it's I feel like it's almost like uh  like a vibrator though where like  sometimes like use it in in addition to  like it or but like girls are gonna have  chatty Whispering sweetness  okay no no tell her something more sexy  no no no no no no no no no no no no no  no no no no yeah like like more like uh  and more sensual well like girls will  say you know anything that'll turn her  on just get her to sleep with me  you know girls will say like like oh  it's like it's great but like sometimes  you need skin to skin content  technically it's more impressive  so I think I think there's  I think there's a decent likelihood we  went from like  the you know agricultural age to like  the Industrial Age and it was like brute  force and might that was the king of  those eras and then we came into this  like knowledge economy where it was like  you know  just broad intelligence was allowed for  you to be extraordinarily successful  and it may be that  um intelligence is about to be ex really  commoditized and everybody is going to  have the smartest best friend in the  world  and at which point in time we might move  into like the kindness economy where the  only thing really left is like the  service industry where being a kind  human and uh and being good to others  and being generous are the most valuable  attributes that a person could have I  like that that's a good time I don't  yeah I don't I don't as long as you're  not a [ __ ] yeah I mean a lot of  people as long as you're not hating on  other people
