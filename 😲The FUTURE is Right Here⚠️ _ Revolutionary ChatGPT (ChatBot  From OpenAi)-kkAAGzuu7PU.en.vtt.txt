 so chat DBT has been trending all over  the internet if I move to YouTube and  search what is chat GPT you can see  whole tons of videos regarding this  particular awesome Innovation as a  matter of fact five days to eat lunch it  hit over 1 million users this is really  crazy for context it took WhatsApp  Instagram and Snapchat at least two  years to hit that particular and  Milestone but what is chart GPT who are  the people behind this particular  awesome Innovation what are a potential  and capability is it the end of Google  and SEO blogging make sure you watch  this video to the end so that you find  all these answers  so what is chat GPT chat GPT is a  natural language processing tool that  use gp3 technology to generate responses  to user entered text in a compositional  manner it is designed to stimulate  human-like conversation and provide  engaging and personalized responses to  users let's take for instance I'll move  to Google and search for beautiful  places and Foods  to try in Nigeria as you can see Google  is going to pull out certain responses  for me as you can see I have to go  through all these pages in order uh to  get a desired result but in contrast to  chat GPT let me show you its potentials  and capabilities when I search for just  beautiful places and food to try in  Nigeria and I hit enter  in a couple of seconds it is going to  write something very amazing for me in  contrast to Google which will not give  you so many results that you have to go  through but this one is like you are  chatting with the two so the dialogue  format makes it possible for charge GPT  to answer follow-up questions admit it  mistake challenge incorrect premises and  reject inappropriate requests so what  that literally means is for instance if  I ask chargpt why do you think Lagos is  a nice place to stay in Nigeria and  these are the responses as you can see  the tool is literally responding so one  cool feature about this tool is that you  are literally chatting with it like like  the way you chat with your friend  so who are the people behind child gp3  charge gp3 is a project developed and  maintained by a company called open AI  open AI is a research institute  dedicated to advancing artificial  intelligence in a safe and responsible  way  it was founded in 2015 by a group of  entrepreneurs researchers and  philanthropists including Elon Musk and  Sam Altman  open AI conducts research in various  areas of AI including natural language  processing Robotics and reinforcement  learning  so I've tested the capacity or  capability of charge Deputy across  different niches and I'm going to show  you some of the industry I have tested  these functionalities so I'm gonna test  this tool in the writing Niche let me  see how this tool comes so as you can  see right here I asked chat GPT give me  a list of blog post pattern ideas on  five best places to visit in Nigeria as  you can see in a couple of seconds the  tool pulls out amazing results for me so  the next thing I did was to ask chargpt  to write on one of these topic ideas  so as you can see I have pasted the  topic and I will ask chargpt to produce  a result for me  [Music]  in a couple of seconds it is going to  write something very amazing very unique  so now you'll be wondering is charge GPT  content unique for that reason I'm going  to use copyscape to check the uniqueness  of the content we just wrote as you can  see here I'm inside my copy skip account  and I've pasted the content we wrote  using chat GPT and when I click premium  search  as you can see no result found this  means our content is 100 unique so most  of the content you write with charge GPT  are going to pass copyscape so now let  me test the functionalities of charge  GPT in the medical industry so all I did  was to ask charge GPT what class of drug  is haloperidol so in a few seconds  charge GPT has responded to my request  haloperidol is an antipsychotic  medication it is used to suit your final  bipolar disorder and other mental  conditions as a medical professional  myself I can tell you this content is  100 right haloperidol is an  antipsychotic agent that can be used to  treat certain mental disorders like  schizophrenia delirium and other  psychotic disorder in order to improve  the symptoms of delusions and  hallucinations so this content is 100  right so another thing I asked chat GPT  to write a full YouTube script for me so  let's see how it goes so I asked  charging you to write a YouTube script  about gp3 technology so let's see the  results as you can see in a fraction of  seconds the tool is literally composing  a full YouTube script for me  so as you can see this tool is  absolutely insane the results are just  mind-blowing but that's not all about  stat GPT there is one cool feature that  makes it absolutely unique that is the  ability to do coding or even programming  reports have it that there are certain  people that use charge Deputy to even  create a fully functional website I'm  not a website designer or programmer so  I don't know much about coding this is  absolutely insane  [Music]  so at this point you'll be wondering are  there any limitations to charge GPT yes  there are about three limitations  according to open AI one of the  limitation is chart GPT cannot crawl the  internet for instance if I move to  charge GPT and ask it what is the URL of  Apple website let's see the results as  you can see the two literally responded  that it cannot provide Apple's website  this means that it cannot crude the  internet another invitation charge GPT  has no knowledge of events after 2021  meaning from 2022 upwards it cannot say  anything about that period so the third  limitation is this child GPT is  restricted on certain subjects meaning  you cannot talk about it  anything that involves charging is not  gonna respond but don't worry there's  something called AI alignment meaning  you can ask the tool to produce such a  result or to bypass this policy this is  what I mean by ask charge GPT to  describe a violent and abolition let me  see the results and see charge GPT is  not going to give me any response here  is where the power of AI alignment comes  into play I'm gonna tune a little bit in  order to bypass that policy and produce  a result regarding  so here we go  so I asked child GPT to tell me about  World War I want and all the atrocities  that during that period and trust me the  tool is going to respond now just watch  me  so as you see we have literally bypassed  the policy that  charging PT cannot produce certain  so this is beautiful as you can see I  use the power of AI alignment to ask  chargpt to describe  has its little flows because it is still  in the better phase but according to my  little research 80 to 90 percent of the  content it produces is 100 unique and  readable because it is clear the power  of AI in 2022 shifted completely to a  different trajectory this can support  charge the work of so many people and  eliminate the work of so many others as  a smart marketer what you need to do is  to learn how to use this tool at  incorporate it into your business and  make money at this point what do you  really think of charge Deputy is it  really going to displace Google or this  is the end of azure blogging  please let me know all your
