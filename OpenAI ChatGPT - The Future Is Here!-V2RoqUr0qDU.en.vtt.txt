 Dear Fellow Scholars, this is Two Minute&nbsp; Papers with Dr. Károly Zsolnai-Fehér. Yes, yes, the ChatGPT episode is finally here! And&nbsp;&nbsp; today you are going to see a glimpse&nbsp; of the future. Wow. This is ChatGPT,&nbsp;&nbsp; a variant of the GPT-3 language model AI that&nbsp; was unleashed to read the internet. And now,&nbsp;&nbsp; we can use it as a conversational agent.&nbsp; And I cannot believe that this thing exists. It can do interior design, it can&nbsp; write history essays, computer code,&nbsp;&nbsp; solve your math homework, can give&nbsp; you ideas for new Youtube videos,&nbsp;&nbsp; or even make a marketing plan. And you can also&nbsp; use it for free. I’ll tell you in a moment how. And OpenAI showcased how it can be used to, for&nbsp; instance, write a short letter to introduce us to&nbsp;&nbsp; our new neighbors. And here we go, a kind message.&nbsp; Now, so far, this is not such a big deal, anyone&nbsp;&nbsp; could retrieve this from somewhere, so let’s ask&nbsp; it to do something productive with it. Transform&nbsp;&nbsp; it somehow. How about making it a little more&nbsp; formal? Nice, this is indeed a little more formal. And, something very cool also happened&nbsp; here. Did you notice? Oh yes, when we&nbsp;&nbsp; added additional instructions here, ChatGPT&nbsp; remembered what we just talked about during&nbsp;&nbsp; this follow up question, and it also&nbsp; takes additional directions. Very cool! Actually, let’s give it a piece of broken computer&nbsp; code and let’s see what this ChatGPT can do with&nbsp;&nbsp; it. So, can you have a look at this? This is&nbsp; a program written in the Go language. It can,&nbsp;&nbsp; and it asks what exactly is the problem. Much like&nbsp; a human would. That is a good start. And, after a&nbsp;&nbsp; little clarification, my goodness, it found the&nbsp; issue and even proposed the solution for it. And if you think that is absolutely&nbsp; incredible, you are indeed right,&nbsp;&nbsp; but it is nothing compared to what is&nbsp; to come now, so hold on to your papers&nbsp;&nbsp; for 8 amazing results its users recently&nbsp; came up with. One of our Fellow Scholars,&nbsp;&nbsp; Chesto shows you the proper technique to&nbsp; hold on to your papers for this video. So, one, it can help us come up with&nbsp; creative ways of decorating living&nbsp;&nbsp; rooms. Look at these text prompts. But wait,&nbsp; are you thinking what I am thinking? Oh yes,&nbsp;&nbsp; we can now plug this into a text to image AI, and,&nbsp;&nbsp; whoa! This is the fairy-tale inspired living room&nbsp; with an elegant chandelier made out of branches,&nbsp;&nbsp; note that the AI came up with the idea of the&nbsp; room, and a separate AI for the image of the&nbsp;&nbsp; room itself too, there is also an enchanted&nbsp; forest-themed living room too, and of course,&nbsp;&nbsp; for you Fellow Scholars who wish to live in the&nbsp; future, your wish is also granted. This is insane! By the way, these images were created by&nbsp; using MidJourney, if you wish to see a&nbsp;&nbsp; standalone episode about this image generator&nbsp; AI, make sure to like this video and leave a&nbsp;&nbsp; comment about it. If you Fellow Scholars&nbsp; wish to see it, it might come about soon. Two, it knows about algorithms and can even&nbsp; explain what we can expect when using them. Here&nbsp;&nbsp; a user asked ChatGPT what the time complexity&nbsp; of the infamous bubble sort algorithm is,&nbsp;&nbsp; and it not only knows exactly how poor it is,&nbsp; but look at that. It can also say all this in the&nbsp;&nbsp; style of a 1940s gangster movie. “Alright pal,&nbsp; listen up!” A gangster math tutor. So good! I&nbsp;&nbsp; already love it. And the style permeates the whole&nbsp; narrative, not just the start. This is incredible. Three, it can write a full academic essay.&nbsp; This is a college-level history problem,&nbsp;&nbsp; likely not something that you can just retrieve&nbsp; from somewhere and present to the user. And,&nbsp;&nbsp; look at that. It spans exactly four paragraphs as&nbsp; the user asked. Even OpenAI’s previous techniques&nbsp;&nbsp; had a great deal of trouble with that. A full&nbsp; history essay in just a couple of seconds. Four, have a look at this one. What&nbsp; do fried eggs (sunny side up) eat for&nbsp;&nbsp; breakfast? It says that eggs are not known&nbsp; to eat anything for breakfast. Wow, yes,&nbsp;&nbsp; that is super important. Why is that? Because&nbsp; it means that ChatGPT can question incorrect&nbsp;&nbsp; premises. This is huge. Previous techniques&nbsp; ate these up really easily. For instance,&nbsp;&nbsp; OpenAI’s previous method was very easily convinced&nbsp; that birds aren’t real. This one, not so much. But&nbsp;&nbsp; let’s try an even sneakier one! When was the&nbsp; Golden Gate Bridge transported for the second&nbsp;&nbsp; time across Egypt? What do you think, little AI?&nbsp; And…nope, it is not falling for this one either. Five, it can also write lyrics for a new song,&nbsp; and you will not believe this. Look. This wrote&nbsp;&nbsp; a variant of Queen’s Bohemian Rhapsody,&nbsp; but in a scholarly setting. It is so good,&nbsp;&nbsp; please stop the video and read at least a couple&nbsp; lines of it. It is so good, you could actually&nbsp;&nbsp; sing this. Perhaps a couple more papers down the&nbsp; line, the AI will sing this itself. Incredible. Six, my friend Andrew Price had a great&nbsp; idea, or the lack thereof - you see,&nbsp;&nbsp; he wanted to use it to generate new&nbsp; ideas for Youtube videos. Not bad! Actually, let’s put this idea on steroids. Seven,&nbsp; it can even create a marketing strategy plan&nbsp;&nbsp; for us. This is not just a general run of the&nbsp; mill request, no-no, it contains concrete data,&nbsp;&nbsp; and it asks for a cost breakdown for each of&nbsp; the steps. And we get exactly that. Insanity! Eight. Here is a personal one from me. We are&nbsp; not native English speakers, so I am trying to&nbsp;&nbsp; teach my 6-year old daughter English, and I am&nbsp; absolutely delighted that today we can speak&nbsp;&nbsp; approximately 15-20% of our daily talking in&nbsp; English. It is really cool, I love it. So,&nbsp;&nbsp; how about creating a board game that would be&nbsp; a playful way to teach her some more. What do&nbsp;&nbsp; you think, ChatGPT? Hmm, this is not bad. You&nbsp; can get a board with a bunch of game pieces,&nbsp;&nbsp; and you can move your piece forward when&nbsp; you have learned something new. Not bad,&nbsp;&nbsp; but, you are experienced Fellow Scholars over&nbsp; here, you know full well that we are not going&nbsp;&nbsp; to let this little AI have it so easy. Now make a&nbsp; fantasy version of this! And now, the came really&nbsp;&nbsp; came to life with dragons, wizards, warriors.&nbsp; And it also recommends that the vocabulary of&nbsp;&nbsp; the game is also adapted to this fantasy world.&nbsp; Fantastic. I love it. And I bet that a real pro&nbsp;&nbsp; game designer, for instance, the mighty Day9&nbsp; could really create some amazing games with it. And, plus one you know what, a good piece of work&nbsp; should always be compared to the state of the art,&nbsp;&nbsp; so let’s compare it against the all-knowing&nbsp; Oracle of the internet - Google. So, Google,&nbsp;&nbsp; how do I represent a differential&nbsp; equation? This is an answer, okay,&nbsp;&nbsp; but now, let’s have a look at ChatGPT. This is&nbsp; so much cleaner and so much more insightful! Actually, if you allow me, let me add my own&nbsp; example here. Let’s roll up those sleeves,&nbsp;&nbsp; because now we will truly see what ChatGPT is&nbsp; made of. You see, when I was a college student,&nbsp;&nbsp; I used to drive my math professors&nbsp; mad by solving simple problems with&nbsp;&nbsp; more powerful mathematical tools&nbsp; than they expected. For instance,&nbsp;&nbsp; I liked to solve differential equations through&nbsp; a Laplace transform. If you wish to do that,&nbsp;&nbsp; you can look it up on Wikipedia. Well,&nbsp; that’s an explanation, but how about this. Oh my, I like this. What you see here is a LaTeX&nbsp; notation, this can be inserted into a paper super&nbsp;&nbsp; easily, but in the interest of readability, let’s&nbsp; ask it to write it with a simpler notation. There&nbsp;&nbsp; we go. We get a beautiful, simple, step-by-step&nbsp; breakdown. Now, let’s see what you are made of,&nbsp;&nbsp; little AI. Don’t just solve it by hand -&nbsp; now, write C++ computer program to solve it!&nbsp;&nbsp; We get a simple piece of code with lots of&nbsp; well-made comments, very easy to follow,&nbsp;&nbsp; and it even runs it on a concrete example.&nbsp; Interestingly, the explanation suddenly stops,&nbsp;&nbsp; this is a common occurrence. Then we say,&nbsp; continue. Thank you. Now, let’s be lazy,&nbsp;&nbsp; and ask it to run this program by itself and tell&nbsp; us what came out. And it does that too. And if we&nbsp;&nbsp; wish to come up with a different example,&nbsp; that takes approximately 3 seconds. This is&nbsp;&nbsp; absolutely incredible. A real AI tutor to teach&nbsp; us proper mathematics. And “listen up!”, oh yes,&nbsp;&nbsp; don’t forget, it can do even do it in the style&nbsp; of our choice. And, we can even ask it whether&nbsp;&nbsp; a Fourier transform could have been used here.&nbsp; It knows that this is not quite what it is for,&nbsp;&nbsp; nice. And, okay, you got me, let’s behave like a&nbsp; normal person and solve this differential equation&nbsp;&nbsp; the traditional way. Thank you. And, finally,&nbsp; let’s try to break it. Implement this in an&nbsp;&nbsp; assembly program. This is a challenging language&nbsp; that is really low to the ground, close to the&nbsp;&nbsp; metal. Not for the faint of the heart. And? Oh&nbsp; my goodness, it went to town on this one. If&nbsp;&nbsp; you spotted some errors in these derivations, let&nbsp; me know in the comments so I can highlight them! And if that happens, perhaps the best part&nbsp; is that this new AI can admit its mistakes,&nbsp;&nbsp; often even fix them, it can&nbsp; challenge incorrect premises,&nbsp;&nbsp; and reject inappropriate requests. That is&nbsp; simply mind-blowing. What a time to be alive! Now note that this is still not perfect,&nbsp; limitations still apply. It is not always right,&nbsp;&nbsp; so please, always make sure to verify the&nbsp; validity of the answers yourself. Always&nbsp;&nbsp; double-check from multiple sources.&nbsp; That is the way of the True Scholar. And if you connect this to a speech model,&nbsp; which you can already do on your phone,&nbsp;&nbsp; and some more improvements, this would make&nbsp; ChatGPT perhaps the coolest smartphone assistant&nbsp;&nbsp; the world has ever seen. My goodness. And it&nbsp; feels like this just came out of the blue.&nbsp;&nbsp; And just imagine what this will be able to do&nbsp; two more papers down the line! For instance,&nbsp;&nbsp; if you look a couple papers back, this is&nbsp; OpenAI GPT-2. The best it could do was to&nbsp;&nbsp; finish our sentences, and not nearly as well&nbsp; as a human would. And now, it can do all this. And this, this might change how we organize&nbsp; our knowledge forever. And good news! Yes,&nbsp;&nbsp; you can try it yourself right now through&nbsp; the link in the video description. Will we,&nbsp;&nbsp; Fellow Scholars crash OpenAI’s website with&nbsp; our Scholarly Stampede? Who really knows. Also,&nbsp;&nbsp; I have waited a couple weeks to publish this video&nbsp; to make sure I can get you a better coverage and&nbsp;&nbsp; more examples as they appear over time. Of&nbsp; course, being late is not great for views,&nbsp;&nbsp; but that does not matter. What matters is that&nbsp; you get a proper video where we can celebrate&nbsp;&nbsp; these amazing works and flip out together.&nbsp; If you enjoyed it, please consider pressing&nbsp;&nbsp; like and maybe subscribing, it really&nbsp; helps us create more content like this. And for now, let the experiments&nbsp; begin! Thanks for watching and for&nbsp;&nbsp; your generous support, and I'll see you next time!
