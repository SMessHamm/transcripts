 friends  [Music]  welcome back to another episode of the  internal Journey I'm your host cam  Knight author of several best-selling  books in the aerial mental and human  performance  today I want to talk about the future of  the internal Journey not just for you or  me but all humankind  so at the end of last year a good friend  sent me a video about the future of  artificial intelligence and how it will  affect society and Humanity as we know  it the video centered around the release  of chat jpt you know that AI writing and  coding tool that has literally taken the  World by storm  as a writer and author my stomach sank  when I saw what this technology could do  writing papers and essays with perfect  spelling and grammar in seconds not days  hours or minutes but within seconds I  thought to myself my author career is  over  it took more than 15 years to develop  and refine my writing skills and chat  gpt's responses to questions and prompts  were not only thoughtful as thoughtful  as someone with Decades of experience on  the topic but extremely well written I  thought to myself if the technology is  this good now in a year or two it's  going to be that much better in a short  time it will be able to write books and  the book industry will become saturated  with books written by chat GPT and other  AI writing tools and then it would be  nearly impossible for humans to keep up  I saw this not just for the book  industry but so many other Industries  like search engine marketing will Google  still be relevant in a few years  computer programming as they can write  computer code and extremely well  teachers professors and other academics  as what is the point of them if chat  gpt's knowledge and answers are  mind-bogglingly more vast  to be honest I really went down a spiral  worrying about chat GPT and the  challenges of humanity like the  beginning of the end was here for us all  all of these jobs will be replaced and  AI will do most anything that humans can  in the very near future  in fact last week I felt sick and I  believe it was from the anxiety about  the potential for this technology  especially on my career  while I was sick my head was all over  the place you know how your thoughts  dripped in a hundred different places  and you start thinking about things you  normally wouldn't and at times even  surprise yourself that you had those  thoughts that those thoughts were  actually created by your own mind  well I had a lot of those around chat  GPT and artificial intelligence and on  the second night of my sickness for a  brief moment my mind stopped becoming so  afraid and saw the positive  possibilities and how the future of chat  GPT and AI can actually help humanity  and in ways we humans can't ourselves  and not just on an individual level but  on a societal and Global level  and that's what I like to talk about  today  as humans we have a lot of challenges  that make Being Human well challenging  one is that we are run and driven by  emotions some might argue that our  emotions are a gift and what truly make  us human  I agree to a certain extent  the problem is that emotions can make  something that is not real seem real and  have us acting and behaving as if it is  real they can convince us someone  doesn't like us when they have no  opinion that something is difficult when  it really isn't that a stranger is  dangerous when they're completely safe  or that someone will be a bad mate when  they will be great and the opposite of  all these the reason emotions are like  that is because our emotions are based  on predictions your brain makes  predictions about people situations  environments and events and based on  those predictions releases corresponding  emotions  for example you're walking down the  street in the middle of the night and  see someone that looks kind of sketchy  based on their sketchiness the brain  will release feelings of fear so you  walk in a different direction  or the brain might interpret the person  as attractive and instead floods your  body with euphoric feelings to encourage  you to go approach him or her  the person might not be sketchy or  attractive yet those emotions are still  released  these are simple examples but our  emotions can get quite complex  for example you might misinterpret what  someone says or does and that trigger  anger and in that anger do something  that you regret  all your emotions can convince you that  a service will be a good deal or more  enjoyable to use when it really won't  most conversations break down because  one person's mind is predicting that the  other person is saying one thing when  they are not  future iterations of chat GPT and AI as  a whole can fill these gaps it can help  us manage our emotions so we don't do  things that we regret or check our  emotions so we don't misinterpret people  and situations  though it can help us beyond that if we  experience emotions of hurt and  Rejection it can soothe us and say the  right thing to feel better  in fact when we are hurt or rejected  what the brain is looking for is  affirmation  it wants to know that it will be okay  and this tool can give us the right  affirmation we need in the right moment  if we are overly aroused it can calm us  down  we can learn all the emotional  intelligence in the world though it's  hard to realize when we're in a strong  emotion but AI by our side can help us  weave these intense reactions  another challenge of being human is that  we have an overly hyper and unrestrained  wanting mechanism most people don't  realize we have a mechanism that creates  wants and it's endlessly creating wants  one after another it sees someone  wearing a nice shirt it wants it it sees  someone with a pretty girlfriend it  wants that too a nice car drives by it  wants that as well this mechanism's only  job is to create wants and for most of  us it is relentlessly creating endless  wants and desires  the wanting mechanism doesn't understand  that our time energy and resources are  limited it simply creates wants it  creates more wants in a month than one  person can achieve in multiple lifetimes  so our mind is constantly creating wants  and the pain associated with not having  that want which can be very distracting  the future of chat GPT can help keep our  wants in check if you're working on a  project or goal and the mechanism  creates a desire for something else it  will remind you of your prior commitment  if there's a possibility that you are  over committing it will warn you so you  don't put so much on your plate and burn  out too quickly  if you have shiny object syndrome which  is what an out of control wanting  mechanism really is AI can keep you on  the straight and narrow  some of the other challenges of being  human arises from our upbringing and the  traumas we're carrying from our  upbringing every one of us no matter our  sex social or economic status or skin  color has experienced trauma some more  than others some a lot more than others  these past experiences are affecting our  day-to-day decisions and actions right  here and right now whether or not we  realize it for example a teacher might  have told you that your writing is no  good and you unconsciously accept it  that you're a bad writer and now avoid  professions that require a strong  command of the written language  this is a small minor example but trauma  and its effects can be a lot more severe  and extreme  future versions of chat GPT can help  resolve these past traumas and the poor  decisions we are making because of them  in addition to helping us talk our  decisions through and determining where  our fear about the decision is coming  from it can help us regress to past  moments to see how our unconscious  interpreted those moments in ways they  are affecting you today  it can give you the exact phrases  mantras exercises scripts and therapy  that you specifically need to get over  these hurdles  a person never need worry about a job  loss because chat GPT can help him or  her work through the emotional response  to the laws losing a job creates so many  anxieties and unknowns will I find  another one will it be better will my  skills be a match will the pay be at my  level and so on AI can help deal and  manage the emotional effects of these  unknowns so people who've lost their  jobs don't fall into despair  at the same time it can find new  opportunities for them it's far reaching  access to the neural net can quickly  find the perfect opportunity based on  knowing you what you like and don't like  and setting certain parameters it will  connect to the neural net and go on the  hunt for the perfect job that are open  and available right now and that you can  start at the time that you set  for society to function we need media  that not only shares knowledge but Keeps  Us on top of current events for a long  time that was done through town hall  meetings then the newspaper then with  the invention of the radio and finally  television and now smartphones  unfortunately our media currently is the  root of division and hate there's so  much anger and violence being propagated  from not just social media but even  mainstream media that we've become a  polarized Society Democrat versus  Republican abortion versus free choice  gun control versus gun right men versus  women and so on it's like there's no  middle ground and if you accept one side  you have to hate the other with all your  might  I personally believe media has  conditioned us to behave this way these  conflicts are premeditated by people in  power and those that profit for media to  trigger strong emotions in us and rile  us up the more triggered we are the more  we consume and interact with the media  whether it's with Twitter tweets  Facebook posts Yahoo comments and  YouTube videos the more we consume and  interact with media the more these  companies make money  this might sound a little out there but  I will go as far as to say that most  conflicts nowadays are no longer  reported but rather manufactured  peace is not profitable and media  companies need large-scale decisions  disasters and debts to keep us in fear  and hooked on screens as it makes them  so much money  if you haven't noticed over the past few  decades news has become more and more  emotive meaning networks are not just  reporting the news but in an emotionally  charged and almost combative way they  are much louder and have more anger in  their voice and that tone seeps into our  unconscious and starts making us angry  without realizing why we're angry or  what we're angry about or what the  reporter is even saying and if it makes  any sense  what if the future of chat GPT and AI  didn't do that what if it didn't focus  on riling us up and polarizing us but  simply reporting facts and events and  brought us together to provide relief to  the people in areas that needed it  the biggest challenge of humans is our  need and drive for power which Frederick  Nietzsche the famous German philosopher  and thinker coined the will to power  more or less we humans and most life on  this planet are power seeking creatures  and most everything we do in one way or  another we do to increase our status and  influence over others this is playing  out on many levels in the macro global  scale in the micro group settings and  everything in between anytime you put  down someone's idea without actually  hearing them out anytime what you want  up what someone says or anytime you play  Devil's Advocate that's a power play you  are trying to gain or maintain status  over them  a lot of this is happening unconsciously  we may think we are doing something to  be nice and generous but it's really to  improve how we look and increase our  social value within a group  this drive is so unconscious and deeply  ingrained in US it even fools ourselves  so much so Frederick Nietzsche even said  as is Will To Power as is my theory  meaning he's putting forth the idea more  to establish his authority as a great  thinker than for Noble intentions  in fact much of what is happening in  media is a product of humans drive for  power the people who own or run these  companies are using it to control our  decisions and actions for their own  benefit and to raise their influence  so how do we manage a species and hence  a society where everyone on one level or  another is constantly competing for  power  and most of the time they're not aware  of it or worse they believe their power  plays an attempt to do good and with  some willing to take any measure to  attain that power  I think this is one of the biggest  challenges of humanity and something  Humanity itself can't regulate history  has shown over and over that giving a  certain group power to regulate humans  hasn't been very effective it leads to  corruption backstabbing and more  however the future AI can if coded  correctly not have any interest to have  one human do better over another  imagine a business executive so focused  on getting to the next level he's  willing to crush and step on anyone  not just his own employees but other  companies  instead AI can help him rethink his  drive and help him see where that drive  is coming from maybe his determination  isn't a determination for success that's  money or power but in reality intimacy  the executive has low self-esteem and  feels he needs to be successful shows  success and that he can provide to draw  and attract a mate  instead of feeding the drive for more  power the tool can help him see what he  really wants and that there's a better  way to fulfillment than more of what he  already has  that evening the executive leaves the  office and as he leaves crosses paths  with a woman the type of woman to whom  he is attracted the encounter is not  random but orchestrated by the AI both  were lonely and looking for the type of  person the other is and the series of  carefully chosen events the AI brings  them together  this brings us to the next topic which  is relationships relationships are tough  not only is it tough to find a good  partner but it hurts when the  relationship breaks down and one person  leaves or moves on  hopefully AI can help us weep through  these difficult challenges of  relationships as mentioned it can help  bring the right people into our life  when we want or need them  it's hard to say how long a relationship  will last or how long one person can be  fulfilling but when it's time to move on  AI can not only help us part ways but  find another partner  also as mentioned communication is a big  challenge with humans and AI can help  bridge that communication gap at the  same time if a person has a tendency to  be abusive it can prevent that from  coming out and make his or her  communication come out in a more sound  and acceptable way  this can be applied on a grander scale  as humans many of our desires and  emotions can become a runaway process we  get something we want like money or  power and then we either want more or to  hold on to it for dear life  when I was in Finland I stayed with the  Finnish family and the mother described  an indisputable human quality  she said we humans like to move up and  rank or lifestyle but not down we don't  like to give up the level or status we  have it's an ingrained trait of The  Human Condition so much so that we will  often fight or use whatever means  necessary to maintain our level  this is specially applies to our leaders  when they gain power they don't want to  give it up and in fact want more that  drive can Cloud what they are already  doing who they are hurting and what they  are becoming to keep or gain that power  AI can be a vessel to help our leaders  see other possibilities and that there  are ways to fulfillment that doesn't  require destruction and gaining control  over others or their rights it can  create a society where we don't have to  always be on guard and solely look after  our own interest because AI will make  sure that our interests are always met  it can even bring our leaders together  in proactive conversation imagine all  the leaders of the world sitting around  a table each wearing a headpiece so when  one leader speaks AI perfectly  translates to every other leader in  their own language in real time  well that's my rant about chat GPT and  the future of humanity in artificial  intelligence it might be too optimistic  Forward Thinking or just plain two out  there  however the goal of openai the company  that released chat GPT and other AI  tools like Dali is to align AI with  human intention and values and to make  it safe and beneficial to humans so it  might not be too far-fetched of an idea  when I came back from my travels and  journey of growth and healing I wanted  to bring a lot of the knowledge  discussed in this episode to people and  create a broader dialogue however I was  surprised to find many weren't  interested hopefully AI might come  across this episode and find it helpful
