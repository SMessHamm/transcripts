 another thing I would love to see get  Incorporated with crypto is Chad gbt  right it's all the rage right now it's  it's supposed to ai's taking over all  our jobs and I don't know like how is  that going to impact crypto will will AI  take over a lawyer's job take over a  lawyers job  so you want to read it all out  okay hello everybody Welcome Back to  team Spotlight so today we have a very  special episode because next to me we  have the very talented the very Charming  Daniel low uh he is every Asian parents  a dream child because you know he is  Asia legal business listed as a top 40  under 40 lawyers  um so yeah what a what an introduction  so I think okay well we just told  everyone my age thanks for that hi  everyone my name is Daniel I am the  chief legal officer for cake defy so  with cake defy I manage the illegal risk  and compliance function I've been here  for a year Still Loving it a lot more  gray hairs but really enjoying it so my  background is I was an asset management  lawyer I did investment funds m a  um that kind of work so been in and out  of asset management firms and law firms  so coming into crypto I think this is is  my first crypto job and won't be my last  so yeah very excited to be here so in  this whole ALB listing you're the only  lawyer that doubles into crypto right  yeah I think I'm the only in-house  lawyer from a crypto company web 3  company right so can you tell us like  you know because crypto is so new um  there is very little legislation there's  very little legislation around crypto  rights and can you tell us a little bit  about your job and what makes um being  in the crypto space very different  compared to a normal lawyer yeah so  you're exactly right I think with crypto  with any kind of industry legislation is  key but because crypto is so new uh laws  may not have caught up uh with  developments so everyone calls  cryptocana fintech 2.0 fintech 1.0 when  it came in with payments and whatnot  laws were not updated as well so they  called eventually and now it's a fairly  regulated industry same with kind of  crypto fintech 2.0 I think that  eventually laws are going to catch up uh  we're all going to be regulated entities  I think it's a good thing  um but yeah I think that's that's where  the kind of industry is heading and you  mentioned just now that this is your  first crypto job right this job first  job in the crypto space yeah so why  choose cake D5  yeah I mean cake defy in one word is fun  I think it's fun because uh culture here  I think it's one of the best I've ever  seen uh just to point out it's only my  third second week on the job and uh you  know I was actually very surprised to  see that Daniel was a lawyer as the  happiest lawyer I've ever seen in my  life wow that's that's really saying  something because most lawyers are  depressed so  uh but yeah fun uh KD5 is very fun in  terms of the culture but also if you  look at the website look at the  messaging it makes it very approachable  for retail customers  um it overall seems like a very kind of  engaging simplified product and I that's  what I really liked about cake defy and  I generally like that about crypto as is  because finances are pretty difficult  they stale and boring it doesn't really  engage gen Z right what not but crypto  does it tries to kind of Empower uh gen  Zin and kind of younger generations to  get into finances so I think it's all a  good thing the crypto space everything  is new everything's moving so fast right  so what are some upcoming Trends and  developments that you're most excited  about  upcoming Trends I think as a lawyer for  me it's definitely regulation  um there are major regulations going on  in the European Union in the form of  Micah which is the new law that's  supposed to unify all crypto legislation  in the area Singapore is also moving  towards crypto regulation a more robust  regulation so I think this area I'm  looking at  across the world you're looking at  crypto bans uh on on kind of transacting  in it but also marketing so it's really  interesting to see where each country  lands which are more crypto friendly and  which are not El Salvador is obviously a  very crypto friendly country hedge  really heavily into Bitcoin but is that  going to be a success how is a  regulatory regime going to be right so I  think these are things that I'm keeping  an eye on it's really fun another thing  I would love to see get Incorporated  with crypto is Chad gbt right so all the  rage right now it's it's supposed to AI  is taking over all our jobs and I don't  know like how is that going to impact  crypto right is that going to help with  kind of a crypto speculation is it going  to help on the back end front end how so  very curious to see how that happens  it'll be quite funny to see if uh GPT  thinks that it can take over hello yeah  yeah so I'd love to see that what's  what's a what's a good prompt for you I  think uh okay will will AI  take over a lawyer's job take over a  lawyer's job  so you want to read it out loud  oh okay that's very political way of  saying it so AI has the potential to  automate certain tasks that lawyers  perform such as document review blah  blah blah however it is unlikely that AI  will completely replace lawyers as they  also perform tasks that require critical  thinking creativity and the ability to  understand navigate complex legal  systems thank you so much here okay so  uh well we're happy to see that uh  you'll be staying with cake for another  next few years that's great that's great  maybe I don't need to hire anyone though  I can just hire chapters between  okay off to the next question as you  mentioned just now crypto is such an  unregulated space it's a new space so  how is it different compared to a  traditional  um lawyer's job you know are we being  sued more often or you know things like  that  good question  um how does being a crypto lawyer  differentiate between regular laws  pretty much yeah uh I would say  very little uh to to not I would assume  there's a lot of learning because crypto  moves so fast and there is these there's  no laws in place yet you see yeah so  it's up to you to do the gatekeeping in  a way so two things one yes so I think  the one thing that I've learned as a  crypto lawyer or a lawyer in the crypto  space uh is staying up to date with news  all the time  when I was in kind of banking Asset  Management I didn't have to read the  news so I didn't read about Goldman  Sachs JP Morgan doing this and that here  FTX this and Celsius that everything has  an impact or trickle-down effect into  crypto whether you're an nft or or D5  and whatnot so I think staying up to  date is tiring but this is something  that kind of crypto lawyers understand  is kind of hard and parcel of your role  uh but why I say that's not really that  different is because if you think about  it say a defy company crypto company you  are a tech company at the end of the day  so any tech company like Google Amazon  you need to look at IP you need to look  at litigation corporate commercial deals  procurement what not so these are things  that you see in regular companies anyway  so almost I don't want to put crypto  companies on a pedestal they're not that  different you're just a tech company or  a fintech company at the end of the day  so  um yeah that pros and cons kind of thing  so so on that note is it can you share  some funny or interesting I guess out of  the box kind of cases that you see only  in the crypto industry  uh yeah I can there's a lot that's  happened the past year as you know one  thing for a Singapore company is that  earlier in 2022 at the Mas which is the  Singapore regulator basically slapped a  ban on crypto advertising so that means  no crypto advertising to retail retail  public and that came as a shock because  there was no notice given and all parts  like industry participants were told on  the same day it was hard because  obviously we're based in Singapore we  were planning a lot of in-person  seminars a lot of promos going on  vouchers and whatnot so we had to put a  halt on everything so that was  interesting because everyone's just  scrambling marketing was scrambling  trying to figure out what to do even to  this day the band stays so we're trying  to Pivot into kind of more Global  initiatives  um but yeah I think that's if you ask  any Singapore crypto company that's a 1  think that they will always flag  so you know being in Singapore  um regulations against things like  crypto they want to put all these  regulations in place but it's kind of  like the opposite of crypto right like  crypto wants to be SD regulator as  possible so as a lawyer yourself do you  are you pro-regulation  I'm pro-business certainty so however an  industry regulates Itself by way of  maybe kind of just a mutual agreement  between participants or by laws whatever  gives that industry certainty that can  operate more efficiently I am okay for  in this space obviously with FTX Fallout  and and uh and whatnot  governments are coming into place  putting into regulations in laws which I  think is completely reasonable because  the industry cannot govern itself at  this point moving forward maybe we  mobilize to the point where we can  actually  govern ourselves we become decentralized  enough that we don't rely on outside  third parties like the government  to implement these rules and laws for us  to kind of by so hopefully that's kind  of the end goal web 3 decentralization  we govern ourselves but in the meantime  I think regulation is a necessity right  this is very off tangent um but you know  in Singapore there's a lot of  regulations in place in a way it makes  your job more difficult right Singapore  singaporeans and Singapore in general  loves rules and laws so I realize that  yeah yeah so in a way it makes your job  more difficult right so why choose cut  why why did you choose to come to  Singapore because you're not from  Singapore originally right no you know  I'm originally from Toronto from Canada  you can't tell from the accent okay  um but yeah I I mean Canada has laws as  well but Singapore even more stringent  right correct yeah  um I think it's because Singapore laws  actually makes sense  um in Singapore and Parliament moves  very quickly when do you remember when  they had electric scooters yes correct  and then within you know six months one  year they took them off yeah yeah  because they were such a nuisance to  society exactly yeah exactly so similar  to kind of say crypto right they move  very quickly into crypto when it first  came out they legislated we have uh the  PSA payment services act uh and we're  having Amendment end of the year year  where some countries have not even  considered  crypto regulation yet so I like the  space because we move fast and we do it  well right so moving off to something a  little bit more light so what are some  significant Milestones or  accomplishments that you've had in the  crypto industry so far  surviving right yeah yeah survival 2022  is summed up by survival I think for a  lot of people as well I think that's and  the achievement is I think really  growing the team the legal risk and  compliance team when I joined I was the  sole GC  um kind of fast forward seven eight  months we have a whole team 11 people  within legal risk and compliance we  built amazing kind of internal  Frameworks uh to kind of make sure we're  risk mitigated compliance wise we're  moving to New countries uh looking at  licensing and whatnot so this is a huge  step for a crypto company and for us as  a kind of like second line advisory  we've scaled up quite quickly and and I  think we've done really great job so  kudos to my team  um but yeah I think survival and doing  all this stuff has allowed us to survive  this long yeah so you mentioned that you  were kind of growing your team right you  started with what now you guys have 11.  so what are some tips or things to look  out for when you know let's say a young  lawyer is wanting to Branch into the  crypto industry  yeah I would say two things one is to  really dive into that rabbit hole to  figure out whether crypto is for you  right  um don't be afraid to kind of explore  and and kind of find out more because  once you're in this industry you it's  it's a 24-hour process you have to keep  updated with news  um dive into new areas of law that you  never done before so this is all very  daunting and full on so if you're not  ready for that just be wary second thing  is I think do not expect that coming to  crypto company you will turn to a crypto  D gen like the Traders and whatnot out  there you won't and you shouldn't you're  coming in as a lawyer as a legal counsel  and your advice means a lot to the rest  of the teams so as much as you want to  be on the same level with them you have  to keep a level head  have to provide accurate advice uh  reasonable commercial advice but be that  kind of trusted advisor I guess in the  company right and see on that door right  um just like you mentioned that you know  you when you come into the company you  you you won't go into you won't evolve  into a Degen yeah right so um on that  note right like how important is crypto  knowledge as a crypto lawyer like do you  have to be a crypto native for you to  even bring into this industry  no right absolutely not I came into the  space  um  kind of not really understanding what  the difference between hot and cold  while it was right  um obviously now I do uh but I think  it's more having an interest in the  space willing to learn and continuously  learn for the next few years especially  as things develop uh you know like for  me it's kind of I'm still learning when  I talk to the product managers the  engineers uh yourself everyone that's in  the space and maybe crypto natives as  well so for me it's always a learning  curve uh new products that come out  brand new right right so cake has a  bunch of new like Innovative products as  well no clue so constantly wanting to  learn right things I know actually you  know I'm still new in the space so I  didn't really know what this whole job  entails you gave a lot of very good  advice to other people watching so if  you guys are interested in joining the  team uh feel free to apply we have we  are always looking for talented people  over at caked5.com jobs thank you so  much for watching you have any last  words to say Daniel Last Words any  parting statements to say  we will see you in the next video  [Music]
