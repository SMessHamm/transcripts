 chat GPT you've probably already heard  of it but this AI chat bot can write you  almost anything you want  write me an intro for a video about AI  chat Bots  artificial intelligence has  revolutionized the way no um  make it more conversational sassy smart  and do it as a haiku  haiku  artificial brain sassy smart and always  on  chatting all day long not bad okay so  how does it work  GPT models or generative pre-trained  Transformer models are like AI language  Wizards they're trained on a ton of Text  data and they learn how to predict what  word comes next in a sentence they use  this fancy neural network called a  Transformer to help them understand the  context of the text so they can generate  new text that sounds pretty similar to  the text they were trained on and once  they're all trained up we can use them  for even cooler stuff like language  translation or answering questions  pretty neat huh  okay the chatbot wrote that as well  um you might have guessed by how  positive it was about itself  to be clear chat Bots aren't new they've  actually been around since the 1960s and  while they've gotten a lot better over  the last 10 years or so their ability  has been pretty Limited  [Music]  chat GPT is different it's a field of  artificial intelligence known as  generative AI which makes new content  from previously learned patterns and  right now the world is going through a  generative AI boom just when you think  artificial intelligence can't get more  intelligent it does you cannot tell me  that that is me I came on here to  frighten you so mission accomplished  computers are becoming artists musicians  animators Architects software developers  journalists  basically generative AI models like chat  GPT are here to make aspects of Our  Lives a whole lot easier and no the  computer didn't tell me to say that just  watch  this is Sam here's one of our Graphics  guys here at BTN and he's going to use  chat GPT to write some code to help  animate some of his Graphics so if I get  to say right and after effects dark  Expressions aren't that counts from 1  000 to  three thousand so this yeah as I said  before it shows you what it wants you to  do to help set the project up but let's  see what it actually does  pretty good pretty good figured it out  and see if it stops at three thousand  hey yeah  pretty good right pretty good okay so it  sounds like you can be a pretty good  time saver yeah for sure  its application is pretty Limitless  which on one hand is exciting but on the  other hand it's making some people a bit  nervy  earlier this year researchers found that  chat GPT alone could pass the U.S  medical licensing exam a test required  for any doctor to practice medicine in  the USA and one that usually takes about  a year to prepare for I mean in two  seconds I could get chat GPT to write me  um  of 1500 words on the impacts of the  Industrial Revolution  [Applause]  [Music]  oh the steam engine the point is this  ability to make coherent text that's  often indistinguishable from a human has  got some people worried  it's really important that teachers know  what students know what they've mastered  and their gaps in their knowledge and so  on that basis we've blocked it from our  education Network some schools in the US  have banned it from their classrooms and  now public schools in Queensland New  South Wales and wa have restricted  access to the program also the group of  eight universities that's these ones  have announced they'll be making some  changes to the way they do exams and  assessments  obviously some teachers in schools are  worried that you guys would just Chuck  your work or exams into chat GPT and  have it churn out an answer for you  rather than learning the work yourself  as long as I don't get caught then yeah  I would use it oh I would definitely not  use it because  um I strive to work hard and I want to  improve myself in my writing like  expressing your thoughts into words that  is something really hard but I feel like  that technology that software could help  like Express that a lot more clearly  your writing might not be completely  yours like it could set out a template  for you to just follow and change as you  want I was told that a teacher tried to  use it for a lesson plan and it didn't  do the best but it gave her a few ideas  of what to do it's going to affect the  relationship between a student and a  teacher with the trust  um between them I like to start from  scratch and just try and put my best  foot forward  about here is a good place to mention  that chat GPT and indeed most generative  AI programs like it aren't perfect so  this model doesn't know when it doesn't  know I'm talking about the the facts and  the meanings this is for us de you from  the Australian Institute of machine  learning so when you ask it about  something and there's something you are  asking about is not in the training data  and it's been never seen or there's no  no knowledge in the model about it this  this model can't just come back and say  I don't know it will fill the gaps  basically the AI is just trying to find  patterns in the words it's learned and  it's not exactly double checking to make  sure what it's saying is Right CNET a  us-based publication has been  experimenting with AI written articles  but it's already been called out for  getting some obvious details wrong even  though they say the Articles have had a  human proofread them but if you are not  expert and you you will trust everything  sometimes you will be very very wrong  basically chat GPT is a good starting  point a useful brainstorming tool that's  why the South Australian government and  South Australian schools have taken a  slightly different approach to AI in the  classroom I I liken the debate around  chat GPT and AI to the exact same debate  that we had when I was at High School in  the 1990s around the internet and  Wikipedia recognize this as a tool that  students have access to and then begin  to say how can we integrate it into  curriculum because it's important to  note chat GPT is only the first while it  won't be used in graded work like exams  the South Australian education  department says that AI will be a  massive part of our future and wants  students to understand how it works and  how it can help in their learning I  think a lot of companies can see the  potential for this it's very exciting  future like it's a what you are seeing  here is a glimpse to a very interesting  future it's clear that chat GPT and  other generative AI models have the  potential to revolutionize Industries  and transform the way we live and work  as we continue to push the boundaries of  what is possible with AI we can only  imagine the exciting advancement and  possibilities that lie ahead
