 hey there and Welcome to our Channel  chat GPT the future of work or a job  stealing AI we're excited to share our  thoughts and insights with you so let's  get started welcome to the future of  work where artificial intelligence is  changing the game today we're talking  about chat GPT a Cutting Edge AI text  generator developed by openai a research  organization co-founded by Elon Musk and  backed by Microsoft but is this  technology a game changer or a job  stealer chat GPT is a large language  model that can generate human-like text  trained on a massive data set of written  works from the internet using a deep  learning technique called Transformer  architecture it sifts through terabytes  of data containing billions of words to  create answers to prompts or questions  but what can chat GPT actually do it can  write emails and essays poetry answer  questions or generate lines of code  based on a prompt this could be used to  develop virtual assistants or quickly  answer customer queries it's also being  used in the marketing industry with 80  000 clients using it to draft ads emails  blogs and other material but there are  limitations to this technology chat GPT  is trained on statistical patterns and  correlations and doesn't have the same  understanding of input or output as a  human it can also be prone to bias and  produce false information which is known  as a hallucination so we'll chat GPT  steal our jobs it's possible that AI  tools like chat GPT could disrupt  repetitive or routine tasks that can be  easily automated including data entry  and processing simple customer service  roles and certain kinds of content  creation however it's also estimated  that by 2025 85 million jobs may be  displaced by Ai and Robotics but 97  million new jobs May emerge from these  changes but not everyone is convinced  singer Nick Cave dismissed chat GPT is a  grotesque mockery of what it is to be  human and visual artists have even sued  AI companies for copyright and friend  management saying their work was used  without permission to train these tools  so what does the future of work look  like with chat GPT only time will tell  but one thing's for sure we need to be  aware of the potential impacts and have  safeguards in place to mitigate any  potential bias or discrimination as  always we'll keep you updated on the  latest developments in the world of AI  and its impact on our jobs thanks for  watching our video we hope you enjoyed  it and learned something new if you  liked it please give it a thumbs up and  consider subscribing to our channel for  more content like this  don't forget to leave a comment and let  us know what you thought until next time  take care
