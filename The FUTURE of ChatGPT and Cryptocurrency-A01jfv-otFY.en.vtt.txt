 Artificial Intelligence is at the center&nbsp; of the future roadway of any industry&nbsp;&nbsp; that wants to remain relevant for the next&nbsp; century. Besides the rather tragic image that&nbsp;&nbsp; legendary movies like Terminators have painted&nbsp; Artificial Intelligence and robots in general,&nbsp;&nbsp; they can prove to be very useful tools&nbsp; for achieving exactly what they are&nbsp;&nbsp; designed for. One of the most useful&nbsp; AI projects in recent times is ChatGPT,&nbsp;&nbsp; an AI that mimics exemplary human interaction&nbsp; and can pretty much answer any question you&nbsp;&nbsp; want in a most human-like manner as long as its&nbsp; database is up to date with the information you&nbsp;&nbsp; require. The crypto industry could also stand to&nbsp; gain something from the integration of this AI. Welcome back to the channel. In this&nbsp; video we are going to examine the&nbsp;&nbsp; future role ChatGPT and how other forms&nbsp; of Artificial intelligence can improve&nbsp;&nbsp; the crypto industry. Or are we looking at a&nbsp; real-life Skynet type scenario in the future? ChatGPT joins blockchain technology as one of the&nbsp; most defining technologies of the 21st century.&nbsp;&nbsp; It has changed how we view data storage and&nbsp; handle transactions. But it is by no means an&nbsp;&nbsp; easy tool to use or even understand. I mean, I&nbsp; was pretty much a dumdum until I read an article&nbsp;&nbsp; titled "Blockchain technology for dummies" a&nbsp; couple of years ago before I was able to grasp&nbsp;&nbsp; the concept of blockchain technology. Without the&nbsp; simple breakdown that many of us have received,&nbsp;&nbsp; it would have flown right over our heads.&nbsp; This is one part of the problem facing&nbsp;&nbsp; the adoption of blockchain technology&nbsp; for use in our day-to-day activities.&nbsp;&nbsp; People do not understand how to use it&nbsp; much less learning how to build on it. ChatGPT can redefine not just the way the average&nbsp; person can build a meaningful infrastructure with&nbsp;&nbsp; the technology, but it is a perfect tutor for&nbsp; many who look to learn about the blockchain. It&nbsp;&nbsp; is a large language model that can interpret&nbsp; and communicate in human language. Like many&nbsp;&nbsp; language models before it, it can be trained&nbsp; on large amounts of text to create and predict&nbsp;&nbsp; words. This is similar to machine translation&nbsp; and applicator language models to suggest a&nbsp;&nbsp; sequence of words. Therefore, with access to&nbsp; a voluminous library of language and code,&nbsp;&nbsp; it can proffer valid responses and coding&nbsp; solutions for its users without exception. Crypto developers and users&nbsp; have plenty of bountiful ways&nbsp;&nbsp; in which they can use ChatGPT to&nbsp; improve on existing methodology. The first instance would be how AI can contribute&nbsp; to smart contract development. One of the most&nbsp;&nbsp; enjoyable and sometimes fearsome features of&nbsp; ChatGPT is the fact that it can generate any&nbsp;&nbsp; type of code including the ones required to build&nbsp; smart contracts. All you have to do is tell the&nbsp;&nbsp; AI something like write you a smart contract&nbsp; code for a specific transaction to be executed&nbsp;&nbsp; at a specified time between two addresses.&nbsp; Like slotting a coin in a vending machine&nbsp;&nbsp; but much cooler, you can expect the blinking&nbsp; dark cursor of the ChatGPT interface to start&nbsp;&nbsp; spewing out lines of code with the parameters&nbsp; you included. The interesting part is that it&nbsp;&nbsp; saves time and reduces the risk of errors within&nbsp; the code structure. You can also ask the AI to&nbsp;&nbsp; teach you how to develop your own smart contact.&nbsp; It will explain the logic of the contact and how&nbsp;&nbsp; it works. You may even ask the AI how to use the&nbsp; contract. It's like your mobile AI device Siri or&nbsp;&nbsp; Alexa but way smarter. All that will be left&nbsp; is the implementation of the code generated. On top of that, it's more than capable&nbsp; of generating code snippets for one-time&nbsp;&nbsp; use. The AI can generate a full-length&nbsp; code and provide the code documentation&nbsp;&nbsp; explaining every syntax and how it works.&nbsp; The functions, variables, and classes and&nbsp;&nbsp; how to apply them. The work of a developer&nbsp; is cut out for them and at little to no cost. It also simplifies the process of community&nbsp; management. Every blockchain and its constituent&nbsp;&nbsp; cryptocurrency needs proper community management&nbsp; to be able to compete with other cryptocurrencies.&nbsp;&nbsp; Full-scale integration of the trained AI will&nbsp; yield quick and accurate answers to any random&nbsp;&nbsp; or frequently asked question that users may&nbsp; have over the project without bugging the&nbsp;&nbsp; developers. It can feed off of the preprogrammed&nbsp; information and explain what the crypto project&nbsp;&nbsp; is all about and direct members on the&nbsp; simple steps to take part in the project.&nbsp;&nbsp; ChatGPT can moderate conversations, oversee&nbsp; the selection of winners in an airdrop event,&nbsp;&nbsp; or regulate topics being discussed in the&nbsp; community. The AI can generate community&nbsp;&nbsp; guidelines and create near-organic content&nbsp; for blogs and social media pages to better&nbsp;&nbsp; educate the community. The AI can monitor&nbsp; and give reports on the growth and engagement&nbsp;&nbsp; of the community and help the founders to make&nbsp; quality decisions that will improve the project. This AI might also be capable of making life&nbsp; easier for you and me. You know how cumbersome&nbsp;&nbsp; it can be to study technical analysis and pick&nbsp; a trade all by yourself. Sure, a crypto trading&nbsp;&nbsp; bot or algorithm will come in handy, but the AI&nbsp; can analyze the market conditions for any crypto&nbsp;&nbsp; of choice, say Bitcoin or the entire industry.&nbsp; Developers can predict what happens with their&nbsp;&nbsp; project and get suggestions based on historical&nbsp; market data that has been supplied to the AI.&nbsp;&nbsp; Traders may also be able to generate predictions&nbsp; for market trends and try to rake in some profits&nbsp;&nbsp; in the short and long term. Imagine if you could&nbsp; get some quality price predictions on your futures&nbsp;&nbsp; trading and scalp the market for profits that will&nbsp; accumulate enough for you every day. It can also&nbsp;&nbsp; help you to choose the type of cryptocurrencies&nbsp; to buy for maximum long-term profits. Other use cases for ChatGPT in crypto are&nbsp; the development and testing of blockchain&nbsp;&nbsp; wallets. It can use natural language&nbsp; to explain the core features of wallets&nbsp;&nbsp; and their security so that users can get&nbsp; the best use out of them. For instance,&nbsp;&nbsp; it can provide near-instant answers to questions&nbsp; you might have about understanding the ERC&nbsp;&nbsp; standard differentiation of Ethereum tokens&nbsp; and wallet addresses so you do not send tokens&nbsp;&nbsp; to the wrong networks. It can also be used&nbsp; to test the efficiency of wallet software. ChatGPT may also provide the much-needed&nbsp; solution to blockchain scalability from&nbsp;&nbsp; the developmental stage. Developers can simulate&nbsp; different scenarios using different data sizes to&nbsp;&nbsp; check the performance of the blockchain&nbsp; network, especially for its speed and&nbsp;&nbsp; slippage. It can also be used to examine the&nbsp; responses of the network to different forms&nbsp;&nbsp; of attacks. User behavior can also be tested to&nbsp; see how the network will be used in practice. Crypto investors may also use ChatGPT to&nbsp; simulate market conditions for trades and&nbsp;&nbsp; predict the price changes of an asset before&nbsp; deciding to go long or short on the market.&nbsp;&nbsp; It provides correct information about the&nbsp; tokenomics of any type of crypto asset. Decentralized applications (aka DApps)&nbsp; are also a big part of the blockchain;&nbsp;&nbsp; however, ChatGPT is incapable of building an&nbsp; application since its function is limited to&nbsp;&nbsp; text-based systems. Although, there&nbsp; are some ways in which you can still&nbsp;&nbsp; use AI to develop decentralized&nbsp; applications. It can automate the&nbsp;&nbsp; process of creating smart contracts&nbsp; so developers can easily build DApps. UI/UX content can also be generated using&nbsp; ChatGPT and can be included into a DApp,&nbsp;&nbsp; making it more engaging for users. Its&nbsp; chatbot functionality can be integrated&nbsp;&nbsp; into a DApp so users can interact with&nbsp; the application using natural language. New cryptocurrencies can develop their&nbsp; whitepaper using ChatGPT. It will rely&nbsp;&nbsp; on the model of an existing white paper or&nbsp; the provision of a rather specific prompt&nbsp;&nbsp; or guideline to produce the texts.&nbsp; Part of the data required would be&nbsp;&nbsp; industry terms and other technical&nbsp; details peculiar to the new project. After all of these applications, the&nbsp; bug-detection capability of AI is quite&nbsp;&nbsp; commendable. Even if crypto developers have&nbsp; the fortitude to generate their codes and&nbsp;&nbsp; build an entire language, they can detect&nbsp; bugs in their smart contract codes using&nbsp;&nbsp; ChatGPT. They just need to paste the code&nbsp; and it will identify the problem. It can&nbsp;&nbsp; also be trusted to fix the problems and save&nbsp; the efforts necessary to resolve the issue. There are truly few limitations on how functional&nbsp; AI can be to the crypto industry. The solutions&nbsp;&nbsp; that many cryptocurrencies require may&nbsp; get valid outcomes depending on the data&nbsp;&nbsp; sets provided to train the model as well&nbsp; as the project specifics. The AI however&nbsp;&nbsp; is incapable of one day revolting and&nbsp; quote-unquote raising an army of cyborgs&nbsp;&nbsp; and taking over the world in the future&nbsp; so you have nothing to fear. If anything,&nbsp;&nbsp; it is a powerful tool that in the hands of&nbsp; professionals including blockchain developers&nbsp;&nbsp; can make it easy to build relevant solutions to&nbsp; different stages of problems. Who knows? Other&nbsp;&nbsp; AI will probably come to further advance how&nbsp; we perceive NFTs and the metaverse at large. Thank you for watching today’s video.
