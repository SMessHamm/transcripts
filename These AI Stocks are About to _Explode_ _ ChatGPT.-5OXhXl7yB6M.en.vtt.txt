 AI in the AI World you've got now Google  announcing the release of the chat GPT  competitor named Bard that'll apparently  be ready in coming weeks keep in mind  Google has been working on language  learning for a substantial amount of  time and one of the easiest ways you  could see that is if you ever use Gmail  and you're typing in Gmail you can  actually see the AI try to pre-fill in  your email for you in terms of hey just  press Tab and it'll pre-fill what we  think you're going to say next  there were reports that this Google  email generator could basically write  the whole email for you but they were  worried that if they showed how powerful  the Google AI chat was that people would  get freaked out this also comes after an  individual developer who worked on uh  Lambda which is the internal uh project  name for Google's artificial  intelligence Lambda standing for  language model Google developed uh yeah  AI basically Lambda anyway this uh there  was a particular developer who was  working on the project who leaked that  he worried the AI was so powerful that  it had actually become sentient now that  is kind of like your worst case scenario  if you've ever watched the movie iRobot  or if you've got any kind of fears about  robots taking over the world you don't  want to hear that robots or any kind of  artificial intelligence is becoming  sentient because it sends the signal  that they can think on their own is what  sentin means so that's that's it's uh  that'll be quite interesting to see how  Chachi PT compares to Google's Bard I  did think the name Bard was kind of lame  they could have come up with something a  lot cooler I kind of think of a Bard as  like going back into like Oblivion Elder  Scroll or something like really like I  don't know maybe even like a uh oh gosh  what was um what's the game called ever  EverQuest you know it'll run around as I  I don't know it just seems like an old  school kind of name so I'm not a big fan  of Bard uh but it's probably still  better than baidu's announcement their  bot is called Ernie  and their their stock was up like 13 on  the idea that they're also coming out  with some kind of AI chat bot baidu's  the Chinese one of the largest internet  companies in the world it's basically  the Chinese search engine it's kind of  like think of it like Chinese Google but  anyway so you've got Google coming out  with a competitor named Bard you've got  Baidu coming out with Ernie and you  still got chat GPT which is very  annoying to pronounce and I always want  to call it chat gbd but but anyway  I don't know it all seems crazy uh the  good news is the beneficiary out of all  of this is the consumer because it  should make search a whole lot more  functional especially if we can  incorporate like Microsoft is trying to  do chat GPT into Bing now that would be  pretty neat now if you can incorporate  chat GPT into Bing oh boy you can  actually make Bing a functional search  engine because right now it just doesn't  seem that great at all just my take I  mean maybe I'm being a little aggressive  here but just my take now a lot of folks  are are uh you know rightfully so  wondering hey you know what's a way to  get exposure to uh companies uh that  invest in this sort of AI technology how  can I get myself some some stock in this  AI uh and I frequently looked at  Microsoft as a potential opportunity for  that but one of the concerns that I have  is you have a relatively small exposure  uh to chat GPT and Microsoft mostly  because of the size of Microsoft so it's  really going to be dependent on what  Microsoft can do with this think about  it a 10 billion dollar investment into  chat GPT by Microsoft really represents  uh somewhere around let's see it's a 1.9  billion dollar company you're talking  about less than half of of one percent  basically going into uh this uh this  this particular company and it's it's  about one half of one percent so for  example every 100 you put into Microsoft  stock about 50 cents would go into chat  GPT and this has really led me to the  idea that I probably don't want to be  the person who's investing directly into  Google for the sake of getting exposure  to their AI or Baidu for the sake of  getting exposure to their AI or  Microsoft for the sake of getting  exposure to chat GPT I'd almost rather  invest in sort of the backbone  architecture I've talked about this  before so I don't want to seem redundant  but I'm a big fan of investing in Champs  and I really believe like the Wall  Street Journal says that chips are  probably the next gold now and that over  the next decade we'll see chips  essentially be uh sort of like the next  gold rush in America and in countries  throughout the world whether it's Europe  fighting for more chip manufacturing  which new factories are being built in  Europe you've got like an example for  example the Taiwan semiconductors is  building a factory I believe it's in  Germany it's somewhere in Europe I  believe it's in Germany to manufacture  Automotive chips like 20 to 28 nanometer  chips you've got uh multiple plants  being built in Arizona and massive  expansions coming to Taiwan  semiconductors plants in Arizona you've  got Intel potentially spending up to 100  billion dollars investing in chips just  in the Ohio region and and various areas  throughout America I mean you've got the  amount of money that you have flowing  into this is absolutely insane this is a  piece by The Wall Street Journal and uh  this is their current estimate I mean  there could be more announcements all  already but just based on projects  announced the Wall Street Journal sees  U.S semiconductor investments in the  next 10 years sitting at 186 billion  dollars that's just the United States  that's not even Global that represents  about the cost of around 29 billion  dollar gigafactories from Tesla so  putting that uh that sort of into  perspective it's it's pretty massive and  so that's where when I'm generally  thinking about AI exposure stocks I  think to myself boy uh you're the more  powerful AI gets the more powerful  compute processes you're going to  require and the companies that provide  that are your sort of picks and shovel  style companies which are all the way at  the beginning you can think about glass  manufacturers uh you could think about  uh chip manufacturing equipment  companies so uh for example you could  think of uh uh Carl Carl device for  lenses these folks stick a lot a lot of  money into glass and mirror production  that goes into the actual chip equipment  manufacturing with companies like asml  which has over a 90 market share for  advanced chip manufacturing then you  look at companies like uh Taiwan  semiconductors that buys a ton of these  chips Apple in their earnings call  bragging about how happy they expect to  be the major customer for Taiwan  semiconductors in for their Arizona  plant this is Apple bragging about  Taiwan semiconductors in their earnings  call that's actually pretty impressive  usually you don't actually see that take  a look at this right here at the bottom  of the earnings call what do you have uh  here it is uh I we don't know exactly at  this point what that'll be this happens  to be a production and chips Act and the  impact of that but we're all in in terms  of being the largest customer for Taiwan  semiconductors in Arizona and very very  proud to take part in that and Apple's  bragging about Taiwan semiconductors  right  so and then of course after you look at  chip manufacturers or chip manufacturing  equipment you want to look at chip  designers who are your big chip  designers well obviously uh Nvidia AMD  massive chip designers qualcomm's got a  little bit more exposure to sort of 5G  and mobile as opposed to maybe server  and data center like you might see at  AMD or Nvidia then you could look at a  company uh like like Intel who's gotten  completely rid of their memory Division  and they're essentially trying to  deprecate their PC Division and get into  really uh Enterprise and and servers uh  and and Intel potentially looking at uh  looking like a company that's just uh  potentially as uh as inexpensive as AMD  both of those selling for a relatively  low valuation whereas Taiwan  semiconductors in Nvidia selling a  little bit more expensively but the  amount of money that Intel expects to  invest in in Ohio is is insane and  they're either going to spend that money  and they're going to win or they'll go  bankrupt because they're a company that  has failed to adapt a lot of people get  frustrated when I mention AMD because or  when I mentioned Intel because they  think of Intel as sort of this Legacy  company that won't be able to adapt yet  what I think is so smart about what  Intel is doing is they're actually  building their manufacturing Fabs uh  fabrication plants to be agnostic of  what kind of chip architecture you're  using now if you're unfamiliar with that  there are basically Three core chip  architectures uh they're uh and one is  sort of Under the Umbrella of the other  but for the sake of argument we'll just  separate it out here so you have x86  which is really the Intel based chip  architecture then you have arm which is  a a risk machine that's actually what  the RM stands for and risk is a type of  Chip architecture and then there's risk  five which is more of your open source  version of risk which these are very  similar to each other arm is deemed to  be very good from mobile this deemed to  be better for Enterprise maybe and and a  PC at the moment but then again you've  got each side trying to interview to be  the best chip architecture but what  Intel is saying is look we don't care  what architecture you use we just want  you to hire us to make your chips and  this is why they're getting contracts  with the Department of Defense this is  why they're investing 100 billion  dollars into new Fabs in America because  they don't care if you want x86 chips  risk five chips or arm chips they don't  care what kind of architecture you want  they just want to make your chips and so  I I see Intel as potentially a decent  play over the next decade as long as  they can actually Garner uh that uh that  that manufacturing prowess now  interestingly Intel right now  manufacture some of their trips with  Taiwan semiconductors and so they are  really calling up asml to trying to get  to try to get as many of the new  ultraviolet uh machines that they can  get uh their lithography machines so  they too can manufacture Advanced chips  three nanometers four nanometers you  know by the end of the decade we'll  probably be down to one or two  nanometers by the middle of the next  decade we may be at half a nanometer and  at some point it's just going to come  down to uh not this transistor size  which is what nanometer measures uh  nanometers measure but rather uh just  who makes the most efficient chip and  that's where to Me Maybe rather than  investing in solely the designers you  also invest in the factories so again  that's where I think Intel tsmc but then  I also think Nvidia Apple uh and AMD is  your designers so so that's sort of my  take I'd rather be investing in that  segment than solely be dumping my money  into Microsoft and Google who are  substantially more exposed to the ad  business so those are some of my  thoughts although you're seeing  substantial Investments go into machine  learning and and potential uh future  uses uh at Facebook as well uh obviously  at divisions within apple as well so a  lot of great opportunities to invest in  artificial intelligence but I'm afraid  to just run into certain companies  solely because they say oh hey we we  have ai we don't want to stay away from  that so uh that's uh yeah asml  absolutely I see you in the comments  here yeah we've been talking about asml  asml has a an over 90 market share of  the advanced lithography uh device for  manufacturing these uh now they are  actually banned from selling their  newest model of advanced chip making  equipment to China China is obviously  very pissed about this asml is able to  sell their older generation lithography  devices to China which which they do and  they sell a lot of them to China but  China's like well we want the new stuff  too and now part of this is obviously  because uh China and the United States  have a lot of geopolitical tensions not  only do they have those tensions now but  they've had those tensions in the past  before China for example stole the plans  for our F-35 fighter jet and then a few  years later ended up announcing and  releasing a jet that was pretty damn  similar to our F-35 which is really  frustrating and annoying because it's  like hey you really are hacking our  stuff they've hacked into travel logs at  Marriott they've hacked into our Health  Care Systems China's really good at  basically trying to steal our stuff now  In fairness to try to catch up and some  might make the economic argument that  hey you know what maybe uh maybe that's  a good thing because it forces both  sides to innovate more but I I I don't  think anyone getting hacked by China is  necessarily something that we want to  even remotely suggest is a good thing  but these are definitely some of the  plays that I'm curious about now I'm  less curious about companies like uh  like for example Pinterest Pinterest was  absolutely like I look Pinterest is a  style of search engine so some people  say hey what about Pinterest for AI  right could could there potentially be  an opportunity in in search within  Pinterest to basically lead people to  spend money  and I hate to say it but Pinterest  scares me uh the reason Pinterest scares  me is I took a very brief look at their  earnings presentation and look at this  they grew Revenue by about 3.6 year over  year but they grew sales and marketing  by 66  in my opinion this is a way that you're  basically showing that the company has  no way of  any kind of operating leverage they have  no operated leverage operating Leverage  is where your Opex can stay stable but  you can actually grow your Revenue  that's what operating Leverage is well  this company has the opposite of  operating leverage basically to maintain  their revenue at near flat they had to  increase their sales and marketing 66  that's scary that doesn't send a good  signal to me now the company initially  dropped pretty decently after earnings  but it's since recovered uh it's  actually almost completely recovered to  about flattened the pre-market maybe  down as much as one percent but that's  not a big deal it initially fell over 2  ten percent and I think what's happening  in the market is you're getting a lot of  earnings that are happening and then the  earnings come out and companies or  investors rather institutions whatever  like oh that's not as bad as we thought  it was but it's still bad when you  actually look at the numbers relative to  other companies so I don't know for me I  stay away from things like Pinterest I  want chips that's what I want that's  where I think the big peepee is in chips  and Chip manufacturing and the beauty is  we're actually going through sort of  this chip trough right now where  everybody's ranting about how uh chips  are an oversupply and PC uh sales year  over year down 32 percent and everyone's  missing this is true Revenue has been  missing Taiwan semiconductors Samsung uh  AMD the numbers have been coming down  the stocks have actually been going up  though because the numbers aren't that  bad and these are amazing companies for  the next decade we just sort of have to  get through that sort of covid uh trough  if you will the postcova trough uh and  and for me I I can't see pricing power  anywhere else like I don't care what  software company you are you need chips  you need compute power and that compute  power is going to get more and more  powerful over time not only is that  compute power going to get more and more  powerful over time but the demand for  that computing power is going to get  more and more powerful uh you know I I  always run into this idea and this  challenge that at some point things will  just be good enough uh and maybe we  don't need a new iPhone every single  year right which we could make that  argument but boy oh boy you look back a  few Generations you look you go back  maybe three years on Apple laptops or  even computer regular PCS or iPhones  you're like it just can't run the stuff  as well as it used to or at least this  what it feels like and often this is  because we're getting more and more  intensive uh uh applications that demand  more and more compute power in terms of  what we're able to do the way we're able  to collaborate with other individuals  it's phenomenal there's so much  potential and so so excited about what's  to come especially I mean think about  the transition even to augmented reality  now a lot of people are like Gavin  augmented reality is BS virtual reality  is like what you the headset you buy for  Christmas and you use it you know one or  two days in a row and then you never use  it again yes fact true but eventually  augmented reality and virtual reality  actually won't give you a headache and  it actually won't suck and boy I can't  even imagine the kind of compute power  that we'll need for 360 Degree uh  actually quality uh virtual reality  relative to what what we deal with today  uh it's uh it's going to be pretty dang  impressive and it's going to require a  lot of compute power and of course  that's where you could also invest in  batteries because batteries will become  even more important as well so uh and  that's that's exactly why you know  almost as if On Cue you have uh Mr Steve  over here suggesting lithium explorers  have been running like crazy 50 moves in  one day and shouts out multiple  different nickel plays here like SPC fni  and ICU and copper plays like f d t and  ATX you know the interesting thing about  the Explorers is you're kind it to me  it's almost like you're you're betting  on gold explorers like oh I I hope the  person I bet on finds gold and then when  they don't they go bankrupt you know  it's like oh dear uh okay is there is  there a particular pickaxe for lithium  uh that's that's whom I want to invest  in or just invest in the battery uh  assemblers whether that's Panasonic or  even battery storage companies like  Tesla and phase Generac solar Edge uh  you know that that might be a way to uh  invest uh in that but then again you  know look even uh even Energizer I don't  think anybody's ever considered looking  at the Energizer earnings report but I  did uh and uh even energizers  complaining about higher costs for  nickel and lithium and how it's  impacting their margins so you know all  these battery manufacturers even though  they can put batteries together it  doesn't necessarily mean uh they're  going to be profitable putting their  batteries together so uh you know  something to keep in mind all right
