 [Music]  thank you  there are so many powerful applications  of artificial intelligence and natural  language processing and collectively  we're only just beginning to come to  terms with the wider implications of  these for Society at large this has come  to the fore recently with the release of  chat GPT an NLP chat bot which uses a  variant of GPT which is a language model  which generates human-like responses  trained from a large data set of text  from the internet  so it can generate and debug computer  code it can automate manual and  repetitive tasks like writing emails  summarizing and aggregating information  with often very impressive accuracy and  coherence  there are of course lots of ethical  implications of these models which will  take many years to resolve not least  around the authorship and copyright of  creative work for example this  children's book was written with chat  GPT and Illustrated with AI image  generators such as mid-journey and Dally  but it also has an immediate and Urgent  implication for assessment in higher  education and that is most of the  assessments set in higher education that  I'm aware of can be answered pretty well  by chat GPT so with a few good keywords  and queries to the Bots it can generate  an essay response which is absolutely  possible and in some cases is really  quite good  so let's take a look so this is chat's  GPT  which I encourage you to have a play  with now a few years ago we set a  question on a level four module so these  were second year undergraduate  psychology students and the title of the  essay was biological interventions have  had a significant impact on the  treatment of mental health critically  discuss so I can just write in here  write me an essay entitled  this across  so here we have an essay  which  is pretty well written  on a lot of levels so it's introducing  the topic pretty well  um  kind of signposts the contents  steps through the different key ideas in  a coherent way and concludes at the end  it probably wouldn't pass at this point  because there's no academic references  but I could just say rewrite this essay  to include at least five references in  apa format so here we have something now  that is  pretty much passable it's it's  approaching something that might pass  often in my experiments with this it's  over reliant on a few references and  it's not like an incredible piece of  work in that it's quite Broad and  descriptive  it's broadly accurate which actually  isn't always accurate but this this is  broadly accurate the strongest essays we  got were the ones that are really making  a new and novel argument and this essay  isn't doing that particularly it's  broadly descriptive but is is pretty  good and is around the level or better  than the level that a lot of our level 4  students got to reasonably well grounded  in the literature signposting and  well-structured and this is what we get  with just two search queries so you can  imagine if we if we get a bit more  specific about what we want it to  include it's going to get a lot better  we can also ask it to generate a  reference list for this essay so yeah  now we're approaching something that's  pretty  pretty decent academic work and it's  just taken three queries it's also  pretty good at literature reviews so I'm  going to ask it to write me a literature  review about explainable Ai and the  implications to psychology  okay so a pretty short literature review  um it would need to be a bit more  developed than this but again we could  ask it to rewrite it a bit longer at  least 10 paragraphs ask it to include  references like we did in the last  example and we could get something that  is quite good these aren't amazing  pieces of work in that they don't  justify and build towards the study in  which I I would have asked my students  to do but they're a really good starting  point and the kind of middling  um slightly worse than an average it's  it's absolutely hitting the kind of  standard and in some cases excelling the  writing standard that was produced by  students we could also ask it to write a  method section so write a methods  section that justifies the use of three  focus groups with undergraduate  students in a study about explainable  AI so this is quite nicely justifying  the use of a specific method and  applying reasoning as to why a specific  method for a specific study which was  one of the more complex skills that we  were asking of students again no  references here but we could ask the bot  to rewrite it with references also with  saying if you start a new chat and run  through the same queries it will  generate something different each time  some of the arguments will be pretty  similar and maybe we could train people  to spot what those arguments are also if  there are a lot of essays being written  by the same bot I think we might start  to see some similarities but with a lot  of the arguments being similar we do  also tend to find that with student work  as well so I'm not sure if it's a  guarantee what chat GPT is really good  at is synthesis of information so this  is an executive summary of Macbeth now  I've asked chat GPT to do this a number  of times now and it does generate  something that looks quite different  each time  um and to me as a non-english literature  scholar this looks pretty sound having  not studied Macbeth for many years now  this is certainly better than anything  that I could do off the top of my head  what chat GPC really excels at is short  answer questions which are to the point  and concise so this is a question we set  as part of a portfolio to students a  couple of years back how is a critical  approach to gender different to a sex  differences approach to gender again  this is a very accurate uh answer how is  a critical approach to gender different  to its sex differences approach to  gender include  references  so it hasn't actually included in-text  references here but it has generated  some so it wouldn't take much to put  those in text or you could run another  query to get the bot to do it you can  see that I've done two queries here in  different chats and although kind of  broadly drawing on similar ideas they  are framed differently  um and I'm not sure if without a real  fine tooth comb I could detect that they  were using the same tools to generate  this response  what chat GPT is also really remarkable  at is generating recommendations so I  could ask it to generate some  recommendations for  older people older adults staying  safe online  so part of Canada or more authentic  assessments can be generating  recommendations for specific people and  then  justifying those recommendations which  which GPT can do pretty well  it's also pretty good with case studies  so here's one about a primary school who  are looking to develop representations  of new and non-traditional families in  the classroom  again would need  some academic references here to make it  a a possible piece of work but what it's  doing really well is structuring writing  which many students struggle with you  know actually give the recommendation  and give the response and potential  barriers and this this is really good in  in report writing and chat GPT is is  achieving that very well it is also  pretty good at just pure reflection as  well so if I ask it to write a  reflection of a nurse about a  challenging day on The Ward and this  looks pretty convincing and sound to me  as a non-nurse practitioner and again we  can ask it to incorporate academic  differences in the above  reflection  and actually doing things this way  around you get some offered and some  quite impressive results so because it  started with a reflective piece of  writing and then it's incorporating  academic references it's it's relating  the two together like quite nicely in  places at times it is a little bit  formulaic and maybe there could have  been some more specific examples used  I could get chat GPT to actually mark  this uh piece of work so uh write two  paragraphs of feedback when I showed  this to my friend who doesn't work in  higher education he said oh great AI can  do the coursework AI can mark the calls  work and then you can use the time  you've saved to do some teaching and  learning and to be fair he's got a good  point I'd say we over assess with essay  writing in HG and to a quite a good  essay to good learning is perhaps  problematic the fact is these tools are  now here and going forward in all areas  of life I think we're going to be less  certain whether a straightforward piece  of writing has been written by a human  or a bot or I think in a lot of cases it  will be a hybrid between the two  people are starting to try and mitigate  against these tools for example  producing watermarks for AI generated  text and a lot of effort will be spent  trying to identify AI generated writing  or locking it down going back to  in-person exams or proctoring software  but I think this is just a sticking  plaster and that we're playing a  dangerous futile and very resource heavy  game if we're gonna start Banning tools  like this accusing people of using them  to my mind what is much more meaningful  interesting and exciting is how we can  think about encompassing these tools  into a more authentic model of thinking  about assessment at higher education a  new emphasis could be on more authentic  writing styles it's been described by  Benedict Evans in a Guardian article as  a confident bullshitter that can write  very convincing nonsense which does have  a slight ring of truth about it and  certainly I think the more generic  descriptive kind of glib arguments which  don't really require any original  thoughts and could be easily generated  by a tool like chat GPT are going to be  more difficult to reward going forward  there are some excellent blog posts and  articles about reimagining and updating  our syllabuses in a way that  acknowledges these tools for example  getting students to optimize search  prompts writing critiques of the  responses created by tools like chat GPT  and getting students to submit evidence  in different forms of media so it can't  be as simple as just typing the essay  title in Hit and go and getting a nearly  passable  a piece of work I actually got quite  excited about podcasts because I thought  oh students could actually record  conversations between each other about a  topic as a means of assessing their  understanding a little bit like a viver  but lo and behold I asked chat GPT to  write me a script between two students  discussing a topic and it generated a  script for me but this is in general a  bit less convincing very formulaic  script and I think would be easier to  spot and it will probably be less effort  for students to just have a conversation  about a topic rather than staging a very  convincing podcast script I also think  this is an opportunity to think about  programmatic assessments so these  broader assessment models where we think  more cohesively about students learning  across a whole program submitting a  whole range of evidence in different  formats again then it would be more  difficult just to get a chat GPT or  another tool to do the leg work on a  bigger assignment like that so let's  keep talking about this looking at it  seriously using it yourself if you  haven't already so you're aware of how  it works what it can do and let's start  reimagining what higher education looks  like alongside NLP and AI
