 hi this is Tom golly I'm at the  University of Tokyo  um it's been two weeks since chat GPT  was released by open AI  and the shockwaves continue to go around  the world people continue to be you know  I'm amazed and kind of frightened at how  how lifelike how effective how smart it  is in some ways  um and also how how stupid it is in  other ways but it's really seems to be a  big leap towards  um a sort of human-like AI  um naturally there are a lot of concerns  about it in terms of will it be taking  away people's jobs will it be used for  um fake news or for  um evil campaigns and those those issues  aren't resolved  um but I would like to talk about an  area of my own interest where I think  maybe chat GPT and similar programs that  will certainly emerge soon  um have positive potential which is in  language learning and maybe language  teaching so I've made a couple of videos  so far about  um how GPT chat GPT might be used by  language Learners maybe language  teachers some successful in some ways  unsuccessful in other ways but overall  quite intriguing quite  fascinating in the the what it can do  it's its ability in some areas  um  linguistically maybe even exceeds the  average average human on the average  language teacher and so um I would like  to think about that what does that mean  for us what does that mean for language  teachers and for language Learners  um in the months and years ahead  so um first of all the  thinking about  uh how how how humans learn language  um so maybe we can focus on two on two  two aspects of human language and  learning so one is people learning their  first language is children  for the most part  um learn their first language from  other human beings so from their their  family and from the kids around them  their teachers at school and things of  course these days children get a lot of  input from media as well too but I think  it said that human interaction  um that is the primary driver of first  language acquisition  but in the case of second languages for  you know teenagers or older especially  foreign languages  um often that that human element  um is has been lacking  um because it's a foreign language  there's nobody around you who speaks the  language that you want to learn for  example and so the reason chant GPT is  so fascinating because it's so  human-like I'm just wondering if it's  has the potential to  um serve that  function of a human interlockular the  function of someone that you can learn  from the way I ideally  um human language learning has taken  place before both for children and for  adults so um but before I I think about  that in a little more detail I want to  think about well I want to be cautious  is that am I just being fascinated by  this new technology is is is is I'm kind  of a you know I'm kind of a nerd I'm an  early adopter of Technology  um and this has been only been available  for two weeks is am I running ahead of  myself so what I want to do first is  think about the history of the adoption  of Technology of new technologies into  language education and language learning  because it goes a long way back  and it has not always been successful  there's been a lot of failed attempts to  uh  introduce new technology to language  learning so one one that comes to mind  immediately of course is printing the  book  um and so this was a revolution in this  time it continues to be a revolution  um the the ability to preserve language  on paper and and to transmit it over  long distances and then since Gutenberg  is able to make many many copies cheaply  and so beginning centuries ago of course  language learning second language  learning foreign language learning  um  was  enabled for many people and and and  driven by the existence of of printed  manner of books and so that was the  books were a very excellent technology  but um they were obviously especially  for language learning they were  inadequate in some ways they're not  interactive obviously but also they  don't have an audio component  um so you can't hear what the sounds of  the language are I remember as a child  um when I was interested in language  checking out books from the library on I  don't know what it was classical Greek  or or French or something like that and  and reading descriptions in the in the  introduction of the books this is how  the sound is pronounced in French or in  in Sanskrit or whatever it was and it  was practically useless for me because I  had not yet studied phonetics or  Linguistics and I had no audio  recordings at that time to to listen to  and so I could not imagine from the  descriptions of the sounds how they were  pronounced so when I think the real  first arrival of  early early adopted technology was audio  recording and broadcasting so with  Thomas Edison and Marconi and others  when they found out that they could  record the sounds of a language and or  broadcast it over long distances then  you know this is a century ago ago more  than a century ago there were a lot of  efforts to apply that to language  learning this was less than a century  ago but I remember in when I was a child  we did have some um  LP records in my home in California so  this was 60 years ago we had an LP  record of I think it was French and  maybe Spanish then my I guess my parents  had bought and I would put them on the  record player occasionally and listen to  them you know bowling sure I don't  remember what it was but it was uh  it was it was they had been bought my  parents had bought them my parents had  not learned anything from them the local  public library had many many recordings  of language lessons like sets of  language educational materials in which  would be a set of LP records with a  company text and I think a lot of people  tried to learn from them and some  probably some people did succeed in  learning the language well or at least  getting a good start from those records  but overall they were not a successful  technology they did not replace teachers  they did not lead to a a big increase in  foreign language learning anywhere in  the world  radio was used as well too here in Japan  where I live I think it's it's close to  100 years since the broadcaster NHK has  been broadcasting I think it was in the  1930s that they started broadcasting um  English and other foreign language  lessons on the radio after World War II  when Japan was occupied by the um  American forces there was a big boom in  English language learning through NHK  um uh radio  and it didn't have much of an effect  there were some people who did learn I  have one good friend who passed away a  year ago  um who learned English quite well  largely from listening to the radio as a  child but those were exceptions  um and so that technology that seemed to  offer so much promise to be able to  spread language learning widely I mean  cheaply  um didn't work very well  later I've in my own life I've  experienced other ones when I was in the  university in California in the 1970s  every classroom in the in the University  had these big television sets up on the  wall hanging from the ceiling  and um they were all connected to a  central control room in those days it  was not yet possible to record  um video on compact cassettes and so  they had these reel-to-real I don't know  how I'm beginning about inch wide big  tapes on really real machines in the  central uh location where they could  have classes this was not only for  languages but also for other subjects  where they could have lectures and the  idea was you wouldn't have to have the  human teacher in the classroom this  students would just go to the classroom  watch the televisions get the lecture  get the education it didn't work in the  three years I was at that University  from 1975 to 1978 I never saw those  televisions being used in any of the  classrooms it was a big waste of money  and so since then I've experienced other  introductions of new technology to  language learning that did not succeed  um  computer-aided there were a lot of in  the 80s and the 90s there were a lot of  computer-aided programs for learning and  you know a few people a handful of  people who are successful in learning  from them but it just didn't work  and so  um probably many of you can think of  other cases like that where some  somebody like me some some educator was  very enthusiastic about about some  technologies we're going to adopt this  and then they you know you apply to the  higher-ups and the administrators as  government officials and they it sounds  attractive this is the latest technology  so therefore we will we will give you  some money to implement it in all your  schools  and it doesn't work okay that often the  technology is not ready yet so  um so I'm obviously now audio technology  if you do technology what I'm talking to  you right now on YouTube is fantastic  learning materials and it has become  very very easy to use and very easy to  watch but there are many cases in which  um things like video and audio and  computer-aided learning were adopted  much too early but I think the reason  they failed was not only the fact that  um the technology was too cumbersome or  too expensive  um there was also the fact that those  Technologies  did not involve human interaction so  um as I said people learn languages from  other people by interacting with other  people so both that  linguistic input and the lingualistic  stimulation that comes from interaction  is very very important but also the  especially the motivation to continue  learning so  um there are some people who can  continue to study a language on their  own for themselves by themselves for for  the months years that is necessary to  become fluent but most people need some  encouragement along the way so even if  you're sitting in a classroom with 20  other 30 other students having that  human teacher in front of the class  looking at you and occasionally  responding to you and throwing questions  at you  um and it seems to be the major driving  force for allowing people to continue  studying and learning languages for uh  the long time that is necessary to  become proficient  so what I'm wondering is does this AI  the AI that has is starting to emerge  does it have the potential  to replace to some extent or to a large  extent the human element in language  learning  well I think we saw a hint of this um  six years ago when uh machine  translation suddenly got a lot better  and so once with Google Translate no  detail and others  um it is possible to some extent to  actually have a  communication between human beings using  machine translation using using a spoken  computer or a smartphone app  interpreters and so that that was a  revolution okay not so much in teaching  okay machine translation can be applied  in teaching but I think it's a  revolution in how humans use language so  before machine translation became  moderately good  the only way for two people who don't  have a Common Language so two people who  who one person speaks Chinese another  person speaks French and neither of them  speaks each other's language and they  don't speak English or any other common  language the only way for two people  like that to communicate to cooperate  was to have a human intermediary so  there had to be one person it had to be  somebody a translator an interpreter who  would translate between them that was a  human being or  um one person would those two people  would learn each other's languages so  they would learn a Common Language okay  so the reason machine translation is is  a revolution is it enables communication  cooperation between people without a  Common Language  um by computer cheaply very cheaply and  conveniently okay it's not the accuracy  has still has problems of course and  knowing how to use it  um uh is is an important issue but that  showed showed the light on how that  could be used well Chan GPT  which we've just been able to experiment  with for two weeks now  um  has it has brings a human element and  even a bigger human element into that a  more important human element in that the  way it  is you're able to continue conduct very  natural sounding conversations and it  will add you can you can ask it to ask  you questions and we'll ask you  questions it will elicit information  from you  and can explain language you can explain  the meanings I've been especially amazed  at how well I can explain the meanings  of words and I can figure out the  meanings of individual words from their  context which is a rather Advanced skill  for human beings many language teachers  are not as good as chat GDP and doing  that in the case of English it's not as  good in the other language I've tested  it on Japanese but it's very very good  with English  and so  I think this  is a Tipping Point for for language  education and for language learning so  all of those previous Technologies had  largely well you know they came too  early there were a lot of money was  wasted a lot of time was wasted and for  those who hope had hoped to replace  human teachers in some teaching contexts  they all though they were all  disappointed so the the Learners  themselves who who didn't have a teacher  could not afford to pay a teacher who  hoped to be able to learn a language and  acquire a language solely from the  audio recordings or the smartphone apps  but most of them have have have failed  they they didn't succeed some people  have but it you just don't continue okay  and it's just not the material is too  hard or it's too easy and it doesn't  adapt to you and it doesn't encourage  you in any way  and so what I see from this from this  new AI this interactive AI  um is the potential for replacing most  of that  so in other words I can easily imagine  um having a spoken bot or maybe a bot  that  um it appears both audio on your smart  speaker and it's also a a avatar that  appears on your screen of your phone or  of your computer and that it it it's  friendly and it chats with you and it  says hello in the morning and it  remembers what you talked about  yesterday and last week and two weeks  ago and um it's also your language  teacher and so it it will  um  remember for for example it remembers  the words that you've studied before  remembers the words that you already  know and it remembers which words you  you don't haven't acquired yet okay so  it's able to create conversations have  interesting conversations about topics  whatever you're interested in and which  it uses this vocabulary that that you  need practice on okay and so a human  teacher cannot do that easily right you  can if you have you have a lot of  experience with a certain kind of  learner you can adapt your speaking  style to this sort of the this is what  you know this is what Junior High School  students in in Malaysia know in English  this is ones they don't know and so you  can adapt to some extent in that regard  but it's clear that that programs like  chat GPT have the potential to to  um adjusts their teaching and their  their speaking their interaction  in a way that is just enough to to keep  improving the the Learners vocabulary  building the vocabulary  um exposing them to different accents  um uh and also obviously grammatical  forms as well too and so it would be  able to do this in a fun interactive way  and this I can easily imagine becoming  virtual characters that would be  sufficiently human-like have warm enough  personalities  and interesting enough personalities to  be attractive to  you know to to to many many many users  okay so some people will resist that but  you know there are many people many  young people these days who are quite  into you know Bots and and virtual  characters there's this one called  Hatsune Miku in Japan it's a completely  virtual character they have concerts you  know thousands of young people go to  these concerts to watch this virtual  character on the screen and I've heard  that you know people get tears and  they're seeing their their virtual  character in person okay and so so  there's a and this will be  individualized for for you um so  obviously the applications are not  restricted to language learning  and obviously there are many possible  applications to this that need or causes  of concern  um in terms of the political uses uh  uses in fraud and many things like that  but narrowing our scope to language  learning in which there has really has  always been a shortage of human teachers  for language learning  um especially for foreign languages  especially and so it has I think it has  a great great potential  so one concern of course so that many  people will have people like like me who  have been language Learners uh teachers  who have made their money by language  teaching well this mean the end of jobs  for language teachers  well that people should be concerned  about that if you should think about  that um I don't think that should is  what should drive the conversation  um I say  um I don't I think language learning  language acquisition is more important  than protecting people's jobs  but I don't think that these virtual  um characters if they emerge which they  probably will I don't think that those  characters will replace the needs for  human Educators  um completely but I do think the role of  human teachers  uh at least in the case of languages  we'll we'll change and so the sort of  the classical  um language class in a junior high  school in high school or university okay  you have 30 students in the class  there's one teacher and the teachers  okay everybody  um open up your textbooks to page 123  we're gonna do lesson 52 today okay  could you please read the text and then  repeat after this and answer this  question and fill in the blanks in the  in the worksheet okay when you have this  kind of mass education like that that  kind of teaching is kind of unavoidable  well I I think the need for that and the  the role for that was kind of going to  disappear so all of the students could  be using their their apps whether it's  in the classroom whether it's at home  someplace else they will have their  lessons that will be tailored for them  that will be interesting and will be  more interesting than that teacher  reading from the textbook in front of  the class  but on the other hand the the  motivational element that much of the  motivation element maybe will be  offloaded to the apps but you know the  the element of  you know what role does this language  play in my life  um why should I continue  um people will be modeling themselves  still on human beings and so I think the  role of the teacher will become more  like a coach okay to you know encourage  and guide the students in their learning  um and and motivating continuing to  motivate the students but much of the  teaching much of the the support for  language acquisition  probably can be done by by this software  so it's it's a new world that's emerging  we've we've it's just it's just has  emerged in in this sense within a couple  of weeks there's is a danger that I'm  being over optimistic it's also possible  that the that the  sufficient sufficiently customizable  um software might not be available for  some time um it's not clear when opening  API open AI is going to replace re  release an API an application program  interface that will allow other  implications applications to interact  with your program that's what would be  necessary also it's not clear whether  when a competing versions of this open  source versions or commercial versions  will emerge but I think it's it's almost  certain  um it's it's the potential applications  in so many fields are are  really really intriguing and and so I  think the technology is going to improve  so as I said in my other videos if you  watch them to the end  um yeah then thank you for watching this  one to the end as well too  uh there's a lot we don't know and where  there's a lot we have to try and so I  encourage language Learners language  teachers to try this software and  especially to talk about it with other  people  share techniques share what what  succeeds what doesn't succeed how can  you can use it what are what are what  are people's reactions to it learner's  reactions to it does it seem potential  does it seem boring and and we'll have  to move on from there so thank you very  much for listening to this far this  might be my last video on the topic but  I might come back in any case but I do  hope the conversation about this issue  goes far beyond this this room in  Yokohama Japan and the people will be  talking about it around the world  so thank you very much for listening
