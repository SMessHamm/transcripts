 bro AI is here to take my job yo is  there still scope for developers and  designers now that AI is here yo will I  have to rethink my entire career because  at this point I am scared of AI I don't  know what it's gonna do hi my name is  abhinav and in this video I'm going to  show you what exactly AI tools today are  what are the misconceptions some people  have around it and why a lot of fears  that you hear about are irrational and  number three how you can use AI to give  yourself a competitive advantage to  boost your workflow so let's get started  and what I need you to do before we jump  in is hit that subscribe button the  world we live in today is rapidly  accelerating and if this is a field that  you are interested in we have a lot more  like this coming up so right now hit the  Subscribe button  waiting  okay now let's get into it number one  what exactly is AI right AI is a field  of study artificial intelligence and  this field of study is not new this has  been around and there have been  developments for the last couple of  decades like I remember there have been  AI papers that I came across that were  as old as the 1980s however today we're  seeing a surge of AI applications the  technology itself is not small part of  some other product that you use it's the  product most of us have already for the  last five years been interacting with  AIS at a very deep level the news feeds  that serve us relevant information  whether that's on YouTube right here or  on your social media platforms that is  an AI a machine learning model that  learns from your actions your behaviors  and then uses that to fine-tune certain  parameters and return results that are  more likely to be engaging when you're  on Amazon and when you're scrolling and  you come across hey other users who  bought this are also likely to buy and  it gives you these suggestions that is a  machine learning model that's being  played there similarly when you're using  your phone and you point at something  with something like Google lens and it  recognizes that object that is computer  vision but all that stuff has not really  created the same kind of fear that we  see today with AI and what's the reason  the reason is we are finally reached a  point where these are Now consumer  products right the technology itself is  not small part of some other product  that you use it's the product so with  that out of the way I hope you now have  a better understanding of what this  technology is the misconception that a  lot of people have is AI is going to  take my job or AI is going to make  a bunch of fields redundant the reason  people seem to think so is because AI  artificial intelligence is getting more  and more intelligent right when me as an  individual as a Creator when I use one  of these AI tools that I'm going to show  you in this video later today  stick around for that  when I use these tools it augments my  creativity right AI is artificial  intelligence but you can also think of  it as augmented intelligence  humans we have been creating tools to  augment our capabilities whether that's  fire to be able to use and store energy  or whether that's the wheel to move  things around well we think it boils  down to when a tool feels like an  extension of your mind  an extension of your mind  so why is this important  well if you look at it the iPhone is a  tool right it's a hand tool for  information and communication and it  works by marrying our tactile senses  with our sense of vision  but if you think about it it's actually  part of a long line of hand tools  extending back thousands of years  the tool on the left here was used to  extract bone marrow 150 000 years ago  extending the sharpness of what our  fingers could do so we've been making  hand tools for some time now and the  most amazing thing is that our hands  have actually evolved and adapted  alongside our tools we've evolved a huge  concentration of muscles nerves blood  vessels that can perform the most  delicate gestures and sense the lightest  of touches this phone that is an  extension of pretty much our body  helps us to do things that biologically  by ourselves we might not be able to do  this is Steve Jobs Court which Likens  computers and technology and says that  it's like a bicycle for the mind it gets  back to the question of what is a  personal computer again uh again another  analogy there was an article in  Scientific American and in the early 70s  which compared the efficiency of  locomotion for various species of things  on the planet in other words they  measured how much energy it took for a  bird to get from point A to point B  compared with the energy it took a fish  to get the same distance and a goat and  a person and all sorts of other things  and they rank them and it turns out the  Condor won Condor was the most efficient  and man came in with a rather  unimpressive showing about a third of  the way down the list somewhat  disappointing  but someone there had the insight to  test the efficiency of man riding a  bicycle  and man riding a bicycle was twice as  good as the Condor all the way off the  end of the list and what it really  Illustrated was man's ability as a tool  maker to Fashion a tool that can amplify  an inherent ability that he has and  that's exactly what we think we're doing  I think we think we're basically  fashioning a 21st century bicycle here  which can amplify an inherent  intellectual ability that man has and  really take care of a lot of drudgery to  free people to do much more creative  work what exactly does it mean what it  means is in the same way that you can  use a bicycle to use less energy and  cover a long amount of distance rather  than just running right that is not a  capability or bond with the bicycle as a  tool enables you to do a lot more  similarly today we're at a phase where  these new technologies which are still  quite early have great potential to  augment our intelligence to be a bicycle  for the mind now all of technology in  general has been helping with that but  this is a new gen generation so there's  going to be a lot more possibilities  that were not previously possible so  does that mean it takes your job away no  it doesn't but what it does mean is the  smartest people get smarter right in  general when you use technology you are  able to do a lot more compared to  somebody who does not use technology  right a very simple example of that  would be in your job imagine if you  could not use all the tools and products  and services that you use today whether  that's Google Sheets imagine just  actually making physical logs whether  that's slack or email communication  imagine having to actually send a  messenger with the message you want to  send or imagine just not being able to  remote work right there is a lot of  productivity and economic unlock that  technology is enable so with something  like this yes the people who are the  smartest the most creative now have this  augmented intelligence partner a  creative partner that can work along  with them with their prompts and enhance  and boost their output do a lot more  than was previously possible but the  reason it a lot of people feel like this  might take their job away is because  what this means is that one person can  now do a lot more  so the people who are let's just say  ranking people like this the people who  are doing just let's just say the bare  minimum  their job is gone why because you do not  now need a dedicated person just to do  that like that is now available very  easily  a quick example of this I know a lot of  Freelancers right  not personally but I know they exist 10  years ago there was a category on upwork  on odesk on these freelancing websites  which was removing backgrounds from  images now that today you can pretty  much within Photoshop just use an AI  application that just kind of removes  the backgrounds similarly you can use  toolsex remove.bg  so designers whose entire job who found  this one thing that worked which is  removing backgrounds and just kept  exploiting that they no longer have a  job they now have to find other things  to do  similarly today we're at the phase where  if you are a beginner and if your  knowledge is very very basic  these tools the core technology of which  is called large language models  are this kind of collection of human  intelligence so you  starting out in a field with very  limited intelligence might have a hard  time  knowing as much or executing as fast as  a large language model  a similar example I want to just give  you is you in a parallel universe you as  somebody who knows a lot of facts right  maybe you were a quizzer you know a lot  lot about the world you're gonna have a  hard time competing with Google in terms  of how much it knows how much how  quickly it Updates this information  as well as how quick it is  right  similarly large language models this is  a new thing on the internet there are  large language modules for text that you  can interact with through apps like chat  GPT right by openai there are also large  language models for images so you can  now create and generate these images  using just a couple prompts and it kind  of queries this large language model and  kind of generates from what what its  form of intelligence is a brand new  image using these hundreds of thousands  of Millions  of images in that data set right so  that's a little bit about how it works  but let's now jump into some real  applications I'm going to show you some  of the things that I have thought to try  with it now of course this technology is  not that new but I've already seen a  scenario where now I want to use chat  GPD I want to use mid Journey in  specific parts now this is the work that  I would have done myself right this is  not something I would have hired a  person for so no jobs lost as such but  if I were ever to get an intern whose  entire job was maybe writing that is  probably not something that I will do  anymore I will use one of these tools  for it  three tools that I think you should be  using right now there's going to be a  lot more of these kind of tools but I  want to show you some examples number  one I want to show you Dali right so  I've logged in here now this is an image  generator I'm also going to show you mid  journey I was using mid-journey for  generating a bunch of stuff this is in  fact  for a website that I'm designing this is  a hypothetical website that I'm  designing for a Garba event right not a  real it's a part of an assignment I  wanted to show how these tools can be  used in web design but this was me  literally generating number one some  ideas so starting from the top here I  did try a web design for a Garba landing  page now this maybe it gives me some  layout ideas but I didn't think these  were great right however I did start  noticing elements so for example these  things here  these elements on top here having a  large  image now these are some ideas that I  was like okay maybe the top section I  could try something like this right so  I'm using it as a generative partner as  a creative partner that can suggest me  things but the suggestions are going  only going to be as good as my prompts  because I have to tell it what I want  right unlike a real unlike a human an AI  right now cannot just do things by  itself why because it has no incentive  to it has no motive to versus here when  I ask get stuff then it's going to  suggest things right so here I was  generating  images images that I can use actually  copyright free in my web designs  you will also see some 3D ones now again  what I like about using these large  language models right like mid journey  and Dolly  is that it really surprises you every  once in a while like this is a very  dramatic nice looking shot now it's not  perfect but  it's definitely way better than just  having an idea in my head like I am not  a 3D designer or illustrator so I would  have probably not done this I would have  probably gone  for Designing this page I would have  gone the traditional route of maybe  using stock photos or imagery or you  know in this case this hypothetical  client I would ask them can you give me  images from your previous  um events that you had  now of course I will still do all of  that but I also have these that I can  really use in between so that  is mid-journey right and I can show you  a little bit how it works  right now I am dming it right so this is  because I've got a paid mid Journey  account which lets me DM uh whatever I  want in private over here however you  can definitely sign up for my journey  and what it does it adds you to the mid  Journey Discord and here you will have  all of these channels now it's a little  chaotic but that's what you get if you  want to use the free plan as of now what  you would do is you would head into one  of these newbie rooms and here you would  say slash imagine  and you would give it your prompt right  so I would say slash imagine and then  give my prompt so let me do that in DMS  but in general I also want to show you  this can be a great way to see what  other people are doing right this gives  you ideas and it directly lets you see  hey they tried this this gave a good  result versus this game something that  was not so good right so definitely use  this and save inspirations  of some of these prompts and try to  figure out what these flags are right  now this is a new tool so you want to  learn what the intricacies of these  tools are and how exactly they work so  real quick showing you how it works in  here so let me try this in mid in Dali  just to show you a little bit of a  comparison right these were some of the  results for this prompt  I'm gonna try again over here  one interesting um meanwhile as we're  waiting for this one interesting analogy  that I came across when learning a  little bit more about large language  models wow this is really bad  let me remove this um  dramatic movement  black background intricate details on  dress  oh my God  try that again a cinematic  full body shot  when you put these in it's not that  these images exist inside Dali what it  does is it uses these parameters through  its model and tries to make something  for you  an interesting way I like to think about  this and I don't know where I came  across this is these large language  models you can kind of think of it as a  composite of every single image that  exists in the world  and now with this  typing a prompt you are kind of taking a  photograph right it's like photography  where this image not in the same way  that it exists but when you do a Google  search you are searching for something  that actually exists on the website  exists on the internet sorry and here  you are typing in something that doesn't  exist but it's generated for you as you  type it in now clearly you can see these  are not great at all mid-journey had way  better examples so personally I actually  don't even use Dali although Dali is the  more popular one I've heard a lot more  people talk about it mid journey is  actually the one that returns better  results a quick note here as of this  video mid journey is on V4 version 4. so  you should with your prompts return dash  dash V4 right pass this right at the end  of your prompt add V4 because let me  show you what mid Journey would look  like otherwise right on V3  Q2 here is a quality prompt so and what  I'm saying is I want this generated with  higher quality by default it's q1  now just to show you an example of what  this would look like without V4  it would probably look something like  this right which is yeah it's something  but it's clearly not something I would  use on a real website for a Garba event  there you go so this is how it works it  slowly renders your prompt here it shows  you your progress it can be interesting  seeing this because sometimes the final  result looks very different from what  you're seeing here so anyways folks that  is mid Journey right this is the more  visual side of things this is how it  stands today this is V3 not good at all  probably  um  just about the same level as Dolly if I  gave this entire  prompt maybe it will do better  [Music]  meanwhile I want to show you the newest  one this is some this is one that I'm  really really excited about this is chat  GPD and this I thought has a lot more  potential  for being very disrupted for designers  so for example right here I'm going to  say I'm designing a website for a Garba  event  the goal  let me just make this big here  the goal is to  sell tickets  share information  and get people excited about this year's  event write me  the PRD  right a PRD here is a product  requirements doc I could also say write  me a design brief but you know you can  try both write me the PRD  for  a one-pager website  [Music]  for this event this PRD should include  possible personas Right user personas it  should mention the  sections that the website has and I also  need copy  text that describes the tradition  of Garba and United which is the company  that has been doing this for  20 years now  [Music]  too detailed well let me try that once  more okay ah  I'm gonna retry the tragedy video was  like no [ __ ] way bro not at all I'm  not gonna do this  not in the mood  not in the mood  are we lunch time  so not so different from an intern then  just kidding so here is chat gbd working  to generate this now typically your  product manager would have to write this  for you right if you were working in a  tech company that has that kind of  structure otherwise let's say this was a  freelance client what you would do is  you would try to figure out which the  client ask them these questions go  through a discovery process try to  Define what the problem statement is and  you would probably come up with this  together maybe you taking the lead on  what it should have but the client kind  of supplying you with the information  that you can put here  now you as an individual can use chat  GPD as a creative partner which means in  this we we're pretty much pretending  like chat GPT is our product manager so  it's you this client and now you have  this product manager who kind of works  for you right chat GPD right here who is  helping you figure out all of this stuff  so let's see how good it is and we'll  try to refine it and work together in  general I want you to treat this as  another person on your team that you are  kind of coordinating and collaborating  with and I'm not exaggerating when I say  this this can actually make you a better  collaborator when you do collaborate  with real people right but let's try to  understand this  okay aspiring attendee experience  attendee event organizer now what I  found very interesting about these  personas right you saw the brief that I  gave  is when we did actually a  brainstorm for this in a live session  for the cohort members we went through  this manually right without chat gbd and  through that Discovery process where we  did a role play with the client we  figured it out we realized that most  people are experienced attendees right  they've already attended Garba it's a  family thing they've been doing for  years  but a suggestion that came out of that  was that we probably need to do this for  an aspiring attendee right we don't  really call it this what we called it  was somebody who's a first-timer who  might not know that hey I need to wear a  certain dress code I can't just show up  in jeans what do I need to bring along  with me is food allowed should I be  parking on the on  at the event right should I is it okay  to take an Uber will there be traffic  right this is a huge event there are a  hundred thousand people who are going to  be at this  now an experienced attendee might have  done this already so they already know  that but a first time user experience  now that is something that we were  anyway considering so great to see that  uh chat gbd has suggested this  event organizer will use the website to  share information with you and I'm not  sure we'll we'll uh design anything  specific for the event organizer but in  general yeah it is a viable idea if we  were using this event to communicate  things with vendors possible sponsors  put a kit for sponsorship uh create  specific sections for do you want to  sign up as a vendor a food vendor  shopping vendor depending on what they  have at the event you could put those  sections in so very interesting that I  put it here I'm not so sure if we'll use  it though  sections event information ticket sales  social media links  copy traditional Garba right so now you  see one very interesting interesting  thing that you might notice here is  charity is not really trying to impress  you by just giving you the most killer  answer  but it is kind of doing the bare minimum  based on what you put in right now you  might see this brief and you'll be like  hey that's way better than the base I  like I just say do me this right but the  reason I'm able to do this is I know  what it's like to work with designers I  know what it's like to work with product  managers right I know that in a team  setting  the amount of context that you're able  to share with somebody else who has to  do the work that context is useful right  telling all this stuff in advance  whoever I'm telling it to I would have  done the same thing if it was a person  on slack that I was talking to and I  probably would have shared a lot more  they would have asked me questions right  and I expect them to ask me questions  because they are kind of then treating  me as the AI and giving me prompts and I  would give the answer  that is exactly how it works in a  freelance client relationship  you as a freelancer you're not just  solving the problem you're helping the  client figure out firstly discover what  the problem is Define  what exactly are we solving then you  kind of start designing you figure out  these different iterations and at the  end you still have to deliver the  outcome right you have to create this  website they want and it has to help  their business with success right and  you're a part of that process  now of course AI can't do all of that  but if I know what I am doing I can use  AI almost as an intern or as teammate  who I can jam with right so now I've  told told this stuff and based on this  it's very specifically given me pretty  much  I wouldn't say bare minimum right this  is really good but I need more right so  what I'm gonna say is firstly  thanks  I like this as a first version  some changes I'd like to see  for the sections  could you elaborate on each one along  with the headline and copy for  I need more detail on what the sections  should be and more ideas on specific  information to include  now typically without AI I would have to  figure this out myself and yeah I would  do it right what I would do is I would  do my research process trying to figure  out number one what's the problem to be  solved  who am I designing this for what are the  potential issues people have I would  probably do some user interviews right I  would do some client interviews  stakeholder interviews right talking to  the people I'm designing this for  talking to people who are going to be  using this I would probably talk to some  organizers  and I'll try to  get a lot of information but then  synthesize and pick the important things  out and then based on what I've picked  out I would then figure out how do I put  it on the page with the appropriate  priority right so the things that I was  telling you about like food counters  um  food counters hardest parking work at  the event how does the guest code thing  work are there any other rules now this  is a discovery process that I would try  to do with the client I would also try  to find other Garba websites that might  have already solved these problems so  that gives me an idea of what I should  be thinking about  but in this case of course this is just  a demo that I want to show you and of  course this might not probably is not a  replacement for user interviews and  following that traditional design  process but this is idea generation  right this can give me a lot better  things to think about and talk to with  my client and my team  so let's just say here  [Music]  um for the sections  actually that's that's the first thing I  want to see  all right I'm gonna ask it one at a time  I want to overwhelm it because if I ask  three things it'll do a 30 job of each  right 33 job of each versus I feel like  if I ask one thing it does that one  thing hundred percent  uh that's kind of how it's like when you  work as a human as well to be honest  but uh let's brainstorm let's go a  little further  and while it's doing this I'm gonna type  my next prompt for the  oh wow this is nice  oh wow  okay event what were the sections event  information ticket sales now I also need  a hero section right the first fold that  I will see when I  um  land on this website  the hero section that people will see  when they first land on the website  write me five headline titles  that catch the  user's attention  along with a sub title for each  in general  it should say something about  this being India's largest Garba  festival  with over 100k attendees  organized by United okay so here we've  asked it for some Heroes section  recommendations  right now this is super interesting  right I actually like some of these  experience the magic of garbage India's  largest Festival  this is dope this is really [ __ ] dope  um if I had to pick one  I would probably go with  see I I'll give you my  um inside okay join the festivities at  Premier Garba event of the year a little  too wordy right nobody calls them  festivities it's a little formal  get your tickets now for the biggest  Garba Festival I might use this for  let's say the ad that I run so the copy  of that but they've just landed on this  page I don't want to immediately give  them a call to action right this is the  call to action right this I would  probably use it for  uh this ticket sales section get your  tickets now I would probably put this  over here right put a little bit of  social proof  dance night away at motion figure this  is a good one as well but I feel like  maybe it's too too long but personally  what I might go with is this  uh subtitles I might go with one of  these not so sure  um but these are still good copies that  I can use elsewhere in the page  uh one thing that you notice is why did  I say this 100K attendees  right organized by this this is just the  client  2050 are in a row because in general  when you're creating a landing page you  want to show social proof  the goal of this is to get people to buy  the tickets for the event now keep in  mind that when this happens during  navratri there are hundreds of thousands  of events like this so it's a  competitive space  for people to say I'm not gonna go for  that and I'm gonna come for this one you  have to convince people that this is the  best now you can of course say it's the  best most anticipated ultimate right  these are keywords that is signaling  that but you also need to show proof and  the way you would show proof you can  show it in a couple different ways one  would be through numbers right talk  about the fact that this is one of the  biggest ones right you're showing some  kind of social proof that everybody else  loves it they are coming for it  25th year in a row that's a reputational  proof you're saying this company has  been doing this for a while  and I would probably also put a lot of  images from the past  events right to show that this is fun  like this event is actually very  beautiful and planned and what the other  people look like show them having fun so  while I might use this these images  let's see  these images  in some places but I would not 100 rely  on this right for example even the hands  are kind of weird here maybe that gets  fixed in a different version  but I would use these in some places but  as much as possible I would use images  now what we just went through right here  is a creative brainstorm I showed you  how I might approach writing this  can AI do this by itself maybe in some  future it can but at this point you  still need somebody to drive the outcome  the outcome at this point is you need to  create that website it actually talk to  all these people you need to actually go  through these iterations right you need  to do some research to understand the  problem space to understand the user  needs  and in general this is ideas but you  need somebody to execute on the ideas  and AI right now is not good enough to  do that  you noticed as I was going through this  I talked about a lot of things that you  can still need to be a designer for you  still need to have design information to  be able to get this level of productive  output from this AI so I hope that gave  you a good insight into how this works  in general AI is not the smartest person  in the room  but  it is definitely smarter than the  dumbest person in the room  will it replace your job yeah if you're  at the lowest common denominator of what  your career is absolutely  right it's just made you redundant but  if you are able to figure out how do I  actually do some of this real time how  can I actually have that model in my  head through practice and repetition  if you can figure out how can I use this  today to get an advantage keep in mind  we're still in the early stages of this  as a technology which means you still  probably have a couple good years to  figure out how you can take advantage of  this by using it in your workflow and in  general you become a better designer  than somebody who does not use it that's  the opportunity here right a mindset  that people have when they talk about  Job disruption is that they want one job  that lost them forever  I hate to be the one who breaks this to  you  but that's not the world we live in  anymore I know I'm a designer now  but I know I'm not going to do that  forever right that's true even for the  most experienced people in the field  and it's definitely true for you right  you are going to be a designer right now  maybe you do that for five to ten years  but you then use these skills to figure  out something new UI ux designer is a  field  became popular only last decade right  starting  2011 2010 onwards right before that web  designers was the [ __ ]  but web designers  a lot of them switch to UI ux design and  a lot of people entered directly into UI  and ux working for mobile rather than  trying to go the old Route similarly  there's a very good chance 10 years from  now we have new Fields maybe we have  something called an AI designer  now of course I am not in the business  of predictions I'm in the business of  helping you figure out what you can do  today to set yourself apart create  amazing work be productive make a lot of  money  and so my final recommendation to you  get comfortable with these tools you are  now not working alone anymore you now  have a creative partner right don't  fight AI  become friends with it  hi um  [Music]  with me you can slide with me if you  feel like
