 hello I am Shane Brinkman Davis Delamore  and this is code and optimism a show  where we explore how to solve problems  faster with software  this week we're going to be talking more  about the Advent of generative AI  but we're going to be talking about this  at the higher level this week it's more  about the optimism than the code we're  going to be talking a bit about how new  technology as it improves our  productivity impacts the marketplace how  it impacts people's jobs all of those  sorts of things  because every time a new technology  comes out that radically improves our  productivity people start getting  worried about job loss and further  there's sort of a second level where  people also start to speculate is there  going to be a point in the future well  there will be no jobs or much less jobs  and a lot of people will not have jobs  and I'm here to say that based on a  logical argument which I'm going to give  you I don't think that's going to be the  case and I think that that has always  been wrong in the past with every major  advancement you know in the 1900s 90 of  the US was working on farms now one  percent of the US is working on farms  and same thing with every other major  productivity technology in the past 400  years  it seemed like it might have been a big  deal it was a big deal but the market  changed  so let's talk a bit about that  so I'm going to be emphasizing sort of  three main Concepts as I explore this  it's going to be the concept of demand  this is going to be the concept of  productivity and the concept of  imagination  so first let's start the usual argument  goes something like this say we've got a  new machine that can one machine can do  the  produce the same amount that 10 people  could have produced and maybe that  machine requires one person to operate  so it's with one person you can now  produce what you could have done with 10  people let's use that as our example and  again I'm sort of using this abstract  example but this is going to be driving  our conversation towards generative AI I  promise we'll be getting back to that in  a more focused way in future episodes  but I want to sort of start at the top  level and then work our way down  so say that we've got this machine that  basically makes us 10x more productive  at building a widget  and when that happens usually the fear  goes something like this that well we  only need one person where we needed 10  before 9 out of 10 people are going to  lose their job  Panic end of the world disaster and  that's pretty much how these arguments  go and I call these arguments the  Luddite fallacies because luddites was  kind of the original anti-technology  um  a little bit of a myth that's not  actually if you look up what actually  the Levites did it's a little bit just  off from that but it was close enough  they didn't like how the new machines  were encroaching on their jobs  and ever since we now kind of use this  term luddites to refer to people who are  sort of anti-technological productivity  progress  so let's explore this a little bit so  here's the first real problem and we're  going to be talking about from the  productivity angle  so first of all what's happening when we  got this new machine that can do  with one person what we could have done  before with 10.  well what's happened is we have now made  it much easier to do that work we are  now it's now easy we found it the easier  way it costs less money it costs less  time to produce these Goods and you know  if the cost is purely labor and the cost  of the machine is small  which eventually this does sort of come  to this direction let's just say it  costs one tenth as much as it did before  to produce these widgets in reality even  if you have a 10x Improvement in the  labor to machine ratio you're still  going to not have a full 10x degrees in  cost because the input the inputs May  are probably the same and the Machine  has Capital expenditures and there's all  these other things but for the simplest  of this argument we're just going to say  a 10x reduction in cost  in a competitive market which is again  assuming there isn't like a patent or  something else that gives that that one  company exclusive rice to this new  technology  the competition within the market will  drive the price of the product down to  the marginal cost  and the company will make a little bit  of profit after this new capability but  most of the price savings will get  passed on to the customer whether it be  another business or consumers  and so when we're getting more  productive the benefits get shared  outside of the company isn't just the  company that's going to reap all the  rewards because they can't because  company a would love to reap all those  rewards but Company B just down the  street can undercut them by 10 and then  companies say like all right we'll  undergo you buy 10 they can keep doing  that until they get to the point where  they are just charging their the small  amount of profit that they can charge on  top of the raw resources the labor costs  Etc et cetera  and the results are the people buying  those goods are the ones that really  rape the real rewards from this huge  productivity gain they get to be save a  ton of money on what they're whatever  they're spending before so they say  shoes quality shoes used to cost a  hundred dollars and now they cost ten  dollars  and again I'm oversimplifying this it's  not going to be a 10x savings right off  the bat but whatever that savings is a  lot of it's going to get past and this  wasn't how it won't happen  instantaneously it takes a little while  for computation to competition to turn  through there's other abstracts but in  general this is where things will Trend  to over time  and so those people say they're buying  shoes maybe they're buying 100 shoes  twice a year maybe that's cheap maybe  it's a thousand dollar shoes if you're a  sneaker fan  um but you then have that extra money to  spend elsewhere and so increasing  productivity has made us more able to  generate wealth these now consumers in  this scenario have extra money they  didn't have before to spend on other  things  if it's another business that's buying  the output widgets that business now  sudden can spend invest that extra  Capital elsewhere to expand their  business more or they may end up just in  turn passing that down to their  customers the the decreased cost  the results are is when you have a  massive change and if this industry was  a non-trivial chunk of the overall GDP  of the overall Marketplace  if we have a 10x change in cost that's  going to Ripple throughout the entire  economy the entire economy is going to  change because of this productivity  change  and that's a bit of the problem with the  Luddite fallacy of  this thing only needs nine people where  there would have been one I mean there's  now only needs one where there would  have been previously ten so a lot of  people have lost their jobs panic  because it doesn't think about the next  steps it isn't doesn't follow that  really critical economic question and  really this is the economic question  this is how you think like an economist  you ask and then what and then what  happens what happens after that what  happens after that what happens after  that because the economy is a dynamic  responsive system  so  that's productivity and keep in mind  nothing else productivity means we've  now had to figure out how to make this  way easier what used to be a really hard  thing to make is now easy we're not  going to go back and make it hard again  except for there will be a small amount  of people who like it from an artisan  standpoint they will like doing it the  old hard way either for the challenge of  it for the hobby of it or for sort of  the authenticity of it and there will be  a small Marketplace that will be willing  to pay 10x the cost for those goods that  were hand hand made that were made in  the old-fashioned old style in fact I  would speculate I don't know if this is  true I do know that it's generally  proven true that all Technologies  throughout history are all still being  produced and all being used so  horseshoes horse and buggy like any  technology throughout history is still  so there's someone out there still  making it I suspect that  pretty much any job that has ever  existed its history there's still  someone who's doing it as a hobbyist as  an artisan there's still an angle there  in terms of a sort of a cultural  heritage angle  but now we get to the next concept which  is demand so what happens when  the widget goes when we got a 10x  difference in in caught labor costs for  going we're building a widget  the real question is will the world  continue to buy exactly the same amount  of widgets as it did before  in which case the demand for that widget  has stayed the same and in which case  there we will only need not one out of  every 10 people that did that part of  the production before in this company so  in that case it's certainly true that  within the industry 9 out of 10 people  doing that job are going to have to find  another job right and we'll talk a bit  about that and I want to be empathetic  to the people in that position because  that can happen that does happen I do  think as a society we need to figure out  ways to help those people retrain retool  figure out how to move the next job  those people are the ones that are legit  impacted but that isn't always the  scenario that's the most extreme  scenario  it's entirely possible that the demand  for that product was capped by its price  that people would like to have more of  that product but given the price point  it was at there was an equilibrium met  where people were like well that's about  how much I can afford that's about how  much makes sense it doesn't really make  sense to spend more because they're too  expensive if there's suddenly one-tenth  the price then demand will always almost  always go up at least a little bit and  it might go all the way up it might go  all the way up to the point where  all 10 of those people are still needed  and they're going to operate 10 of those  machines and we're going to produce 10  times as much stuff as we did before  that's entirely possible it's entirely  possible it'll go above that and that's  one of the ways that companies utilizing  this technology can actually end up  really benefiting and that they could  end up growing considerably because they  can offer a much the same product for a  much lower price rate or a higher  quality product still at a discount  price rate all kinds of things happen  because they're producing things more  efficiently and they can deliver more  value per dollar to their customers  so demand can either stay the same or it  can go all the way up and match the the  proportionally compared to our new  productivity it can go bigger  but here's my point even if it's date  exactly the same in terms of the number  of units that the US world needs  again that is saving a huge amount of  money for the downstream customers and  those customers now have this extra  scaffold that they're going to spend out  in the economy and what that will do is  that will shift demand to other segments  of the economy now people will spend  that money elsewhere where they were not  spending it there before  further they put this new technology  there's almost assuredly going to be new  opportunities for new  segments of the economy to be created  with entrepreneurial effort  and so  this leads me to the important point  which is that although demand within a  specific product may be limited although  it may not it may well it typically will  have some limit at some point but it may  be way ahead of where we're already at  so we might scale up to it and our  productivity still knock you up and  spoiler alert I think that's what's  going to be the scenario for generative  AI I think that's certainly for software  I'm going to be curious to explore the  artistic case but certainly for software  case writing software my belief is that  if generative am makes this 10 times  more productive then we're going to need  all the programmers we have and more  still because there's so much software  to write because all problems can be  solved with enough knowledge and all  knowledge is ultimately what software is  about and you have heard this person the  server before  so rolling back  that's within one product category but  across all product categories I'm going  to suggest and I believe this to be true  that demand is unbounded across the  entire market demand is unbounded so  even if a specific product maybe it's  rubber ducks maybe there's a certain  amount of rubber ducks that the world  really wants right now and even if you  make them a dime a dime a duck people  are not going to buy any more rubber  ducks  if I can apply by Robert Oxford  Diamondback it comes to think of it at  this point  um  but across all Industries demand is only  always unbounded in that we're always  going to need everybody available  working in order to supply the demand  and here's why it's a really simple  argument everybody wants to be a  bajillionaire everybody would love to be  a billionaire everybody would love to be  a trillionaire everybody would love to  basically improve their current  situation better everybody would like to  have a bit more and because of that  they're going to be out there as as a  consumer as a purchaser of serve goods  and services looking for ways that they  can exchange their capital for benefits  in order to become a more wealthy  individual in the greater broader  Society  and if demand is unbounded  that means that there is demand will be  limited our ability to supply an  infinite demand will always be limited  by our current technological level  multiplied by basically our people our  technology level multiplied by our  people is going to be the amount of  stuff we can produce at any given time  and so if you're trying to hit an  infinite a near infinite Target with a  finite amount of people and a finite  amount of Technology  every person who wants to work will have  an opportunity to work if they look for  if they look enough to see where they  can be productive in society  so even if we get 10 times better at  writing software 100 times better  writing software 100 times better at  building art at creating art visual art  storytelling whatever else  we are going to find demand that drives  that and  I think that that's fairly airtight I  think that that is again I'm going to  say it again I'm sort of setting aside  the case for artificial general  intelligence I think there is an  optimistic story to be told there too  but I think that this current  scenario short of AGI will always have  the scenario for sure where demand is  basically unbounded  so that's the demand story now I want to  shift to the last one which is  imagination  so again the general fallacy is that  oh you see that given the if you assume  the demand is static the demand is not  changing then all sudden if we can  produce this thing 10 times more  efficient then we only need one tenth of  people nine people nine out of ten or  ten people are out of job  panic in the streets that assumption  again is this one step thinking it does  not think about the step after that or  the step after that and largely speaking  that is a failure of imagination I don't  wanna  people who are afraid of these things I  don't want to insult them by calling  them a failure in the scenario so if  you're hearing that  I want to say that in a very specific  way imagination imagine the future is  hard particularly when you're going  through a radical change and Technology  level a radical change of productivity  will result in a radical new economy and  it's true been true across history it's  been very hard for people to predict  where the market is going to go through  this transition so it's natural to have  a failure of imagination in looking  forward in terms of what might happen  through a radical change in the economy  and I'm not I've got some guesses where  things are going to go but I expect to  fail on this too but what I want to say  is that we should all assume our  imaginations are failing myself included  that we are not going to be able to  adequately imagine what's going to  happen the most of the economy but we  need to remember these core things like  demand is unbounded that and that even  though technology is going to make us  way better at producing things it's not  going to make us literally infinitely  better it will make us some finite  amount better but it will not make us  infinitely better and once we hit that  finding them out they're still going to  be constraints on production and those  constraints are not going to be ever  keep up with the unbounded demand and  therefore we will always have demand for  a fully engaged populace  so imagination is the key here and  Imagination is something that you can  practice it's something you can get  better at and it's something that you  can work on to see what is that Step  Beyond  9 out of ten people are not going to  have a job now well we already know as  I've already been discussing that demand  is going to shift and change that's  going to impact how this is all going to  work we know that that in turn is going  to drive demand for other segments of  the market are going to get a huge  demand boost they didn't expect that's  going to drive demand for brand new  markets that were not never possible  before those ones I'm particularly  interested in but those are the hardest  ones to predict  I think it's an exciting thing to be  here when things might become more  productive  so those are the three things I want to  leave you with that aspect that  productivity means we are now able to  make things much more cost effectively  and much easier we found an easier way  to do something and that is good that  means that we can get solve humans  problems or Humanities problems we can  make our lives better easier that's good  but they're solving problems always  creates new problems and there will  always be an unbounded amount of extra  work that needs to be done because of  the unbounded demand demand is unbounded  that's the second thing and the third  and final thing is Imagination  that what we need to do is practice our  imagination to imagine what happens next  what happens after we start employing  these 10x machines what happens to that  Marketplace what happens to a Json  Marketplace is how are people spending  going to change what new possible  industries does this even make possible  because of this order of magnitude  change in productivity  I think that's pretty exciting I think  for particularly for software  engineering with these changes and we're  going to talk a lot more about these in  the future episodes I think that we have  the potential of dramatically increasing  our ability to solve problems with  software and that is important solving  problems is important that's how we make  our lives better and it is fabulous that  it's going to make us better that is my  point of this whole show is how can we  solve problems fast forward software and  generative AI I think is going to help  us get there and it may not help us in  the most obvious ways I'm going to talk  about that more in the future but it  definitely will help us  I'm not entirely sure it will be a 10x  Improvement it might be a 2X Improvement  some people think it's going to be a  thousand X Improvement I'm not really  sure where it's going to lie in that  Spectrum but no matter where it lies I  am fairly confident that there's going  to be demand for all the developers we  can possibly get  particularly the developers and here's  my parting thought  that get good at working with the new  machines okay go to the new technologies  ultimately the people that succeed in  industries that are disrupted by  technology are the ones that learn how  to work with the new machines the best  because those are the ones that are  going to be the people who can now  produce 10 times the output of what they  were able to do before the people who  resist the new technologies who don't  like them and try not to use them  they're going to become just not cost  effective they're gonna it's gonna cost  ten times as much for them to produce  something as it is for the person who  got good use Technologies  so we as people whose jobs are now  getting augmented with this acceleration  Technologies it's incumbent upon us to  learn how to use them how to lose them  as effectively as possible to get the  most out of them to be on The Cutting  Edge of leveraging these tools to solve  problems faster  so with that I will say thank you once  again for spending your valuable time  with me oh I guess I will also just say  as always this is a conversation I don't  have all the answers I would love to  have a conversation please send your  comments down below I'd like to have  your thoughts on all these things I am  going to do one more episode after this  on this sort of high level this was sort  of the economic angle I'm going to do  sort of the humanitarian angle next next  week and then we're going to dive into  more of the Practical stuff of first I  want to talk about generative II in  general and what it is how it works and  there's lots of other stuff out there so  I'm not going to go too deep into that  but I'm going to talk more about what  its limitations are what are the  capabilities and what are its  limitations  and then we're going to talk finally  about practical pragmatic how do we  start using it in our day-to-day stuff  and that's probably an ongoing  conversation for the rest of the year  so with that I will just say remember  that all problems are solvable with  enough knowledge  [Music]  [Music]  foreign  [Music]
