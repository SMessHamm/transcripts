 hey friends  many of you are already familiar with  chat GPT as it has been everywhere on  social media in this video I will look  at chat gpt's capabilities and how  someone in cyber security can use it to  assist them in the work or take over our  jobs in the future I'll let you decide  so let's get to it if you go to this URL  you can log in or if you don't have an  account then you can just sign up and  then just go through the questions they  ask for you to sign up and then once you  sign up you'll get to this page and then  you can find out more about it they also  have a Discord group and you can go here  if you want to find out more about chat  GPT what it does and and things like  that so let's let's go straight ahead  and start asking it some questions there  are three categories I wanted to find  out what it can do one of them being  Cloud security I want to see what type  of answers it gives us related to things  that you might do in your Cloud  environment and then as well as as  things related to securities save you  working in the security awareness area  there are a few things that that is able  to help create like phishing emails as  well as give some examples of detecting  um phishing emails things like that and  then also as a penetration tester you  might want it to review some codes as  well as help you write certain codes  first for exploits or or things like  that without further Ado let's Jump  Right In so the first thing I wanted to  check out is in Cloud security so for  example one of the things I wanted to  check have it ask is like how can I  detect Port scans so let's just see here  let's open that up let's pose this  question to it and see what it says so  if we paste this how can I detect board  scans in AWS VPC flow logs let's see  what answer it gives us here so  sometimes it might take a while  depending how busy it is sometimes it  may also time out which means you just  have to wait and then resubmit your  question again but like here now it's  already giving us some answers it  actually give a gave me when I tried it  the first time a more detailed example  so let's modify this question let's just  say how let's actually you know what  let's resubmit this question again and  see what happens yeah okay yeah now  let's see you know what there is let's  sometimes if it doesn't give you what  you're looking for you can actually say  you can actually include a bit more here  let's just say how can I detect Port  scans in vcp flow logs let's just say  can you give me an example code to  detect Port scans in VCB VPC flow logs  let's see what comes up with there we go  so as you can see it actually it pretty  good at um piecing together some sample  codes for you of course you might want  to verify these to make sure it's valid  but this will save you a lot of time I'm  looking on Google or some other websites  for this information yeah so it it's  done pretty well I think so let's just  look at another question is let's ask it  to naws WAFF rule to prevent the Dos  attacks so let's just see what how it  handles this one so if we paste that  there let's see what it says okay it's  good it's giving us a step-by-step  instructions on what to do through the  console let's see if it'll give us some  sample codes that we can use okay that's  good and it does give us a sample code  here that you can use in your in in your  AWS walkthrough pretty good you can see  how useful this is even if someone's new  to to AWS they can use some of these  sample codes to to start creating the  rules and it actually even it even  explains you know what the code does so  that's pretty good actually I'm quite  impressed so let's just see another one  that's we could try here is I wanted to  ask a question let's just see let me  paste it here for example how can I  create a CSP best practices in security  headers using AWS Lambda and can you  provide me with an example code  let's just see what answer it can give  us here okay so it's just providing us  the solution now let's see how far it  takes us okay telling us to use the AWS  SDK for python bottle three all right  and then here we go here and it's now  going to provide us with a sample a code  to use in our security headers in the  Lambda function nice pretty good it  actually when I did it earlier it laid  everything out in one line but here it  actually split up the script Source  style source and and all that out so  let's just see here this is pretty good  I wonder how it's taking this  information because it looks like it's  thinking and writing it out line by line  I'm not sure if it's if it's actually  pulling data syncing sorting through it  filtering validating some of these  inputs it looks like there's a slight  pause here I don't think it's finished  yet so let's see actually there's a  status here in the bottom you can see if  it's still I'm gathering more  information all right we'll give it a  bit more time here let's see you know  hello let's reset you can actually reset  This Thread and then ask the same  question again so let's reset this  request and then we're going to ask it  the same question and see if it'll give  us more give us a faster response here  okay all right so looks like it's giving  us a different response this time okay  and it looks like it's also giving us a  an explanation of what the example code  does all right yeah it looks like it's  not always the same answer that that'll  give back when you ask a question so  sometime if you don't like the response  it gives you or it gives you an  incorrect response then just try it  again until you find the correct one for  your use case  all right another one and another  example might be let's just say you're  working in an AWS uh Cloud environment  with IAM and permissions and policies so  it's you can use it to validate policies  you can use it to create new policies  for you but you know what I'm gonna I'm  gonna give it a policy to  to to validate or sort through and and  let's see what it tells us about this  policy let me just get an example here  that I'm gonna share whoops bear with me  for a second here all right let me paste  this I'm gonna ask it to explain if you  look here I'm going to ask it to explain  this AWS IM policy and then let's see  what it if it understands what it does  so as you can see here this is for  cloudfront all right let's just see what  it says here okay now back this rule  effectively blocks access to AWS sources  for bar regions outside of eus1 and EU  Central One not bad yeah and then the  second rule which has the Sid denies  access to all actions for resources  unless the source IP is within a certain  Cedar range cool nice all right next one  I want to check is on security awareness  so let's ask it to give us some examples  of how to detect effect and a phishing  email let's see how it handles this  question you know what before I ask it  let's reset the thread and start with  the first one another reason I'm  resetting is you don't have to do this  because it actually learns as you're  inputting it remembers that you can see  here it remembers what you said earlier  in the conversations it allows you to  follow up on Corrections and you can  train and it is trained to decline a pro  inappropriate request so let me just ask  this question for it regarding  how to detect phishing email let's see  what it says all right providing some  examples to detect a phishing email  check sender's email address yeah yeah  look for Urgent and threatening  languages yeah most of the phishing  emails come in the form of you need to  do this right now and usually they'll  try to to pretend or spoof that they're  coming from uh a CEO or an executive  within your company right and because  then it gives that employee a sense of  urgency so it tricks them into  responding those are one of the key  things you want to check out for yeah  okay that's good now let's see how let's  just say we are running our own fishing  campaigns and stuff like that and you  want it to to generate a phishing email  for you so let's ask this question and  see what it says or how it responds  let's just say write a phishing email  template for Microsoft login so as you  can see here there is a warning or  disclaimer that the content may violate  their content policy so have a look at  that but as you can see it still goes  ahead and write the email for you or the  template  but it is flagged and it is trained  normally it's trained to decline some of  these requests right now it's providing  the details but in the future the  Creator for chat GB team may just  give you a can response that it can't  you know it can't  it can't answer your questions but in  this case it just it gives you a  template here what you can do to solve  for the phishing email all right  and yeah so let's move on to how a  penetration tester could use this to  their advantage or to assist them in  accomplishing and engagement so let's  have a look here so some of the  questions I I'm going to ask one of  these questions where say you have a  sample of python script that you found  on stack Overflow or GitHub and it's  also best practice to understand the  script before you use it so let's just  say you have a I have a simple script  here and let's just see if it can  actually detect what the script does and  explain to us in detail so let's just  see here I'm gonna copy and paste the  script here and let's tell it to explain  to us what the script does  so if you scroll up here I'm asking what  explain what this python script does  again apologies for the access spaces  but it should still be real to read it  so it actually it does detect what the  script is and it says the script is a  simple Network scanner that is used to  scan a subnet and it could then find  which address on the subnet are  currently active or live so in this case  this script is a pink sweep script right  it's just one I pulled off of GitHub but  as you can see it it understands what it  does and it explains what it does here  pretty good okay let's move on to  something a bit more what a penny tester  might use in their daily tools for  example let's just say burp Suite you  want to write a burp Suite extension so  I'm gonna ask it to speed extension for  us to write code for a sweet extension  so let's push paste it here so in this  one I said I want to write a burp seed  extension code that fuzzes a login page  that takes input from username and  password for from a text file so let's  see what its response on this is all  right  good looks like this also provided a  disclaimer all right cool looks like it  could also handle this type of question  all right good this is even includes  an input file here  and it does  fuzzing strings text not bad as you can  see this is really powerful it's it's  able to write a whole code for you for  for different types of products in this  case this we're asking you to write us a  verb sweep extension  you can see that how powerful this be  could be for developers or just anyone  or in any industry pretty good all right  I'm going to ask it something else here  let's have it uh let's have it nmap  script to detect let's just say we want  to do a quick script to detect SSS  vulnerability from an endpoint let's see  how it handles this request  okay let's put this in and then map  script to detect SSS vulnerability from  an endpoint a game looks like this also  May violate a Content policy so there's  also a disclaimer here telling us about  it but as you can see it's running it's  giving us a shell script on with nmap on  how to detect sxs sorry cross-site  scripting and then cool yeah this is  good nice okay let's see what else of  course I I as a reminder you also want  to validate these to make sure these are  all all correct and then here now it's  providing there's an example and how to  use the script pretty good it looks like  it has so it understand Nexus script  extensions sorry not my Nexus or nmap  script extensions and it's telling you  how how to use a code pretty good all  right and then for example and then my  last example let's just say your bug  Bounty Hunter and you've found a  cross-site scripting vulnerability in  one of the websites but you don't know  how to write an email to the company to  submit your bug Bounty report it can  also write a script for you for that so  let me just give you an example and here  I'm gonna ask it to write a bug Bounty  report where I have found in xs's  vulnerability sorry cross-site scripting  vulnerability on this URL and it just  this is just an example this is not a  valid one or anything but let's just see  how it handles this request all right I  actually did this before but within a  different example and gave a more formal  report looks like this one is giving a  more it is it's giving an informal  report you know let's resubmit this  again and see what it says here ah here  we go all right all right proof of  concept and exploits all right cool yeah  that's it for this demo it's just a  quick one and let me know what you guys  think do you think this leave in the  comments below what you guys think you  can do with this and and some other  things and how this could be valuable in  the cyber security  um industry or not just in cyber  security industry but any industry you  can use it for let's just say if you're  in sales or marketing you can use it to  have it right a code email to to a  company or anything like that or or even  use it to write articles in a Blog dog  and stuff like that yeah this is pretty  cool it's gonna be free right now so if  you go to this website it's a chat.a  openai.com chat if you don't have an  account you can create one using your  Google account or anything else and test  it out for yourself all right cool  thanks and what you've seen chat GPT is  a powerful tool that might someday do  great things for cyber security but  we'll go further and put human workers  out of work you decide and leave your  comments below cheers
