 why you need to start using chat GPT  today hello my friends how are you doing  so here I have 10 reasons why you need  to use this jet Ai and we all have these  busy lives we all have things where we  need help with things we don't  understand I want to show you 10 ways  you can use this AI that are absolutely  amazing mind-blowing I'm so in love with  this tool and the cool thing is you can  use it for free right now you can test  it you can give feedback to the  developers now of course the first way  to use this is to write prompts for the  AI that you want to use for images like  mid-journey or stable diffusion now here  you can see some results that I got with  the mid-journey they're absolutely  amazing and the good thing about  michionne is that it understands clear  English language and still can create  amazing images from that now when you  are in stably Fusion automatic 11 11 you  can also get amazing results with this  but I would highly suggest to you if you  want to make your work a little bit bit  easier to use the dreamlike diffusion  model that I showed you last time in  this video so now let's have a look at  what the interaction with the chatbot  actually looks like so here I ask not  for a prompt I'm asking to describe a  short paragraph for the portrait of a  fantasy world Alchemist and as you can  see here it writes a short paragraph the  cool thing in here is it describes the  scene in a very nice and creative way so  let me read it to you a little bit the  portrait of a fantasy world Alchemist  depicts a mysterious and powerful figure  in flowing ropes and surrounded by an  array of strange and exotic ingredients  that already is pretty amazing and  creative the alchemist's face is etched  with ancient wisdom their eyes Pierce  and all knowing these are very nice  adjectives and also very creative style  of writing really appreciate that now we  describe the scene here it says they  stand for for some reason it says they  not he or she stand in front of a large  ornate cauldron surrounded by an array  of bubbling beakers and test tubes again  beautiful details the portrait is  rendered in a Fantastical style really  cool with vibrant colors and swirling  magical energies the overall effect is  one of a mysterious and powerful figure  capable of creating magical potions and  elixirs that can change the world so  there's a lot of information in here  about the details about the character  about the Ambitions of that character  too all of that is really cool and you  can see here from the resulting  portraits we are also getting really  cool results from that now of course as  always in stable diffusion I'm using  some negative prompts just for good  measure now of course this is a very  easy example so what else can we do with  this AI one thing thing of course is  searching for knowledge that you don't  have here I'm asking what is PIP for  GitHub or pip so this is giving me a  nice explanation in very plain English  that even a Layman can understand so it  says pip is a package management system  for python that is used to install and  manage software packages written in  Python it allows you to install packages  from the python package index  pypi and other repositories and manage  the dependencies between them now if you  don't know what repositories are or what  dependencies are you can also ask the AI  and the good thing here is that chat GPT  will understand that you are still in  the same topic in the same conversation  so it will give you the answer in  relation to your last question of course  in this case Python and GitHub so that  is really amazing and this is so much  easier so much faster than using Google  and going through different pages to  understand what is going on another  example for using the AIS to help you  write emails because often we don't know  how do I phrase the email or how do I  actually write a professional email if I  have to so here I asked write a  professional email that makes clear I  want to cancel my internet subscription  this result that AI is giving it sounds  very good it sounds nice it sounds  friendly it sounds professional  everything is in there now of course  there are some details in here that you  might not want in there for example it  says I have recently moved to a new  location that might not apply to you but  you can simply delete that from the  email it also makes some suggestions in  here that you might not have for example  it says I understand there may be fees  and penalties associated with canceling  my subscription I'm willing to pay such  fees man you might not be willing to pay  such fees but you can always ask the eye  to write a new version or to give more  specific details on how you want to have  the details of that email written but  the overall tone is really nice one  thing I also really appreciate about  this AI is if you ask for different  situations in your life for some life  advice if you don't feel so happy if  you're sad if you're down if you don't  know how to achieve a certain goal or  how to do certain things in your life  you can ask the eye and you get a very  nice and comprehensive list of things to  do that also give you some additional  steps and ideas on how to get started  with this again in very nice Layman  English that is easy to understand so he  have asked how can I have a more  fulfilled life and it gives me a list of  different points I will just give you  the starter points here so it says  Identify your values and goals practice  gratitude cultivate positive  relationships engage in activities that  bring you Joy take care of your physical  and mental health make time for  self-care give back to others all of  these are great points and as you can  see there's some more information for  them on how to get you started with them  and this is really helpful and it is  also very to the point of what you're  actually asking again I feel like with  asking the chat AI I'm saving a lot of  time because often you have these long  elaborate complicated blog posts that  feel like you're reading a novel while  all you want is a simple and quick  answer to solve problems in your life  and I feel like this AI is doing that in  a very beautiful way another thing I  really enjoy about this AI is to ask  questions about things I don't know so  here I'm asking what is the difference  between Thai Buddhism and sand Buddhism  and actually this game gave me a really  good answer that includes historical  points philosophical points life  practice points of the Buddhists in  these religions so I get a very nice  overview over the differences in these  short paragraphs here again I don't need  to waste my time looking through long  articles on Wikipedia or reading books  on that to understand what is going on I  can just ask the specific question I  have and then if you have follow-up  questions on these texts here you can  talk with the AI to understand it better  so for example I asked the AI about the  concept of avoiding suffering in  Buddhism why would you avoid suffering  and isn't the avoidance of suffering the  wish for that a new source of suffering  and it actually gave me really good  answers to understand that what the  concept is and how it is practiced and  how you find a balance between solving  yourself offering but also not being  overwhelmed by trying to solve the  suffering problems so that was really  really interesting and very insightful  at the same time another thing here that  is really good is that you can use the  AI for your human interactions  especially in social media especially  when you're texting other people so here  for example let's say you're angry  you're aggravated you want to say ah I  don't like this but you don't want to be  so angry in your text because you know  it will just lead to online fights and  online discussions you don't want to  have that so I asked the I write this  text in a nicer way I really don't like  your attitude too much my work and that  of course is a text that instigates  trouble and a fight and it will not lead  to a solution so here is the text that  AI is writing it says I understand that  we may have different perspectives but I  feel like you added to towards my work  is not very positive is there anything I  can do to improve the situation or  address any concerns you might have so  this is a very good example of how to  diffuse the situation because you are  starting by saying I understand your  feelings I understand the troubles you  have can we find a solution together  please elaborate on why you have  problems with what I'm doing and then we  figure out how we can both be happy with  that all of that is in that short text  and this takes out the anger and the  Heat of the conversation and goes  towards understanding and a solution  really a very good example of how to  diffuse problems and interact with  people another thing I asked the eye to  do is to translate text into other  languages because we don't speak every  language out there and here I too  translated of course into a language  that I speak so translate into German  the text I'm looking forward to meet you  for a dinner can you bring my favorite  book that I borrowed you last month I  would like to lend it to another friend  and the translation for that was  actually really nice very fluent and  very human way to speak German so that  is perfect and this is also different to  other translation tools where often the  text feels a little bit stuffy it feels  a little bit robotic here the  translation as a German speaker I feel  this is very natural and it feels also  friendly has a very nice tone to it so  I'm very happy with that translation  next we have another thing that is spell  correction of course you can do spell  correction with the tools you have in  your browser and there's also other  tools like grammarly for longer text but  this text AI here can do that also for  you and this is one of the big  applications where you want to have an  AI that can do multiple things for you  give you multiple solutions for your  problems in different areas without  having to use all of these kind of  different tools so here I ask for the  spell correction of the Renaissance was  a period of great art and literature and  of course I wrote a lot of these words  wrong and then it put out a text that  actually has all of these words right  and it has them right in a way that also  understands the context of my text so  that is pretty amazing another thing I  also often do online is to look for  suggestions for example here what are  great books to learn about AI now the  biggest problem I think you know that is  when when you search online on Amazon on  Google you get suggestions that might  not be the best books that might be  biased because someone wants to make a  quick Buck either because it is  suggested things on Amazon where people  have tricked the search engine or it is  lists on blocks or other pages that just  try to promote the best affiliate links  the best deals so they make money but  you don't get the best product now here  I have a very nice list of different  books some are pretty complicated to  read others are nice for beginners too  so it's a little bit of a mixed bag but  you probably can also ask for the good  beginner books for AI and get a better  list for beginners so that is pretty  good and also I feel like with the AI  the AI doesn't have a reason to select  one book over another because this  doesn't include any affiliate links and  also I feel like this AI is more  unbiased because it is trained on  millions of books so this is just a  suggestion out of all of the knowledge  of the AI and of course you can use this  for all kinds of other lists all kinds  of other suggestions so that is pretty  amazing and last but not least we have  to creative use of the eye to support  you in coming up with ideas coming up  with scenes coming up with stories so I  asked write a short story about a female  hero in a big city and it does this it's  a short story it's not the deepest story  it's not the most amazing twist it's not  the most amazing crafted literature work  but what it does is it gives you a nice  scene it gives you a nice simple story  that then you can build out you can make  bigger you can make deeper with your own  imagination and another thing here that  is beautiful is you can follow this up  with questions about different things in  the story and the AI will elaborate on  that and will deepen and the story will  deepen the details give you more  insights about the scenes about the  character stuff like that so you can get  more information to help you craft  interesting stories craft interesting  scenes or characters or whatever you  want to do creatively now one of the  downsides of this chat AI that I want to  point out here is that this AI doesn't  have a character it doesn't have  opinions and it also doesn't learn from  the conversation over time now this is  understandable why the developer did it  in this way for the test that we have  right now but the problem is if you want  to have a conversation with another  person the most interesting the most  important part about the conversation  with the other person is to learn new  opinions and to see New Perspectives on  the world and this is what this a I  can't really give you because like I  said it doesn't have a character doesn't  have opinions but what it does is a very  rich pool of information so you can  still learn a lot of things you can  still be inspired in a lot of ways now  here is also why I think this kind of AI  is the future of our interaction with  technology out there because right now  we have a lot of things already that are  automated and that try to be  individualized towards us in the sense  that the algorithm is learning our  tastes but still all of that is very  stuffy it is very static it is not down  to my individual need to my individual  problems now this AI can do that and  respond directly to me directly to what  I ask and give me a specifically created  answer just for me and that saves a lot  of time and it is much much more  effective than for example going on  different language Pages going on  Wikipedia trying to look up different  sites to learn something to get some  insights or to get the answers you're  looking for now another thing I really  appreciate about that is that this AI is  giving me a lot of solutions that  usually I would need to pay different  services for and as a Creator this  actually can really drag you down  because all of these Services out there  for example like grammarly or like  MailChimp or like other services that  help you with Social Media stuff like  that each of them is between 20 and 50  bucks sometimes more per month so if you  need 10 of them you already down at  least two hundred dollars per month that  is a lot of money and often you only  need it for Simple Solutions like spell  correcting a text where I feel I don't  actually want to pay that much money  just to spell correct things now if you  have just one service that works really  efficiently has the same interfaces easy  to use and is low cost at the same time  that is an absolutely amazing solution  to have for any kind of thing you want  to do with your life in your life and  also in your professional capacity
