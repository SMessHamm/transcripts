 hello everyone today we're going to use  open ai's chat GPT to attempt to create  a python trading strategy now for those  of you that don't know my name's Leo I'm  an actual algorithmic Trader so the  point of this video is you're going to  get to walk alongside me as I see the  chat GPT responses and I'll comment as  an actual professional Trader and see if  it just pumps out lame you know Golden  Cross moving average trading strategies  all right let's see what we get here so  first things first can you create  trading strategy geez  all right let's see what it says yes I  can certainly help you with training  strategies so uh chat GPT I believe was  trained on Wikipedia and GitHub if I'm  not mistaken I haven't really dived too  much into it I'm gonna actually start  diving more into it because it's you  know the new hot thing and there's  things that we could do to potentially  do sentiment analysis and stuff like  that but let's go ahead and go back to  the prompt here  okay some prefer to start off by a set  of technical or fundamental analysis  tools that will use to guide their  trades others may prefer beginning to  find the response okay I'm going to tell  you that this is a financer but the real  truth is you need a market philosophy if  you don't have a market philosophy where  do you you know believe fundamentals  Drive the market emotions Drive the  market uh you know psychology  you know the FED drives Market if you  don't have an underlying philosophy of  what moves the market you need to get  one right because what will happen is  you start trading things will go against  you you need to have those core root  beliefs to be able to stick with your  trading systems and understand why  things work right uh so anyways okay  fine an okay answer something I'd expect  to be on Wikipedia how about we ask it  give us the components of a trading  system here I'm looking for it to  respond with like a a data model Alpha  model risk models uh reporting  management things like that so give me  the components  of a trading system  okay let's see what it says the trading  system a set of rules or guidelines that  Traders use to make decisions when a buy  and sell financial instruments the  components of a trading system can vary  depending upon the specific approach and  goals the trader but some common  elements of a trading system include  Market selection yes that's important  you know different markets have  different properties some are more mean  reverting and some are more trending you  know that's one of the reasons why uh  you know all of this knowledge passed  down from Trader to Trader sometimes  incorrect is because you can't apply  them over various markets entry rules  exit rules position sizing uh you know  not really what well risk management  okay what else does it say  I'm not so sure I'm happy with this  answer  oh you know what I have a trading system  you know what  I think I made the mistake here  um it should be an algorithmic trading  system right because I just asked for a  trading system my mind is so used to  algorithmic trading systems  um that uh I think I made the mistake  um  please give me the components of an algo  rhythmic trading system all right so in  regards to a regular trading system yes  I would argue that coming up with um  trading systems to generate profits is a  lot easier than this one right here  psychological management this is one of  the reasons why I got actually into well  I love Tech and computers but one of the  reasons why I got into algorithmic  trading was to conquer that and uh  uh execution right all right yes I  understand this  okay trading strategy that's fine that's  I will call that the alpha strategy data  inputs data model  execution logic sure that you'd want an  execution model that's when you you know  decide you know basic things like how  you buy it you buy it in chunks do you  buy it over time uh you know so that's  view app or t web things like that very  basic risk management maximum amount of  capital performance evaluation okay so  wouldn't necessarily be the way that I'd  phrase it but these are good answers  um so so far uh from a you know from my  perspective if I was a new Trader this  would be uh pretty fantastic right it's  giving good answers maybe not extremely  nuanced answers and obviously that comes  with experience but pretty good answers  for a beginner okay  all right give give me some examples of  an underlying rating strategy then  right because it says you know only as  good as the underlying training strategy  there are many different underlying  training strategies that can be used  Trend following uh biased financial  instruments that are rising mean  reversion  mm-hmm  Arbitrage  news based okay again very good general  information  machine learning yep  okay yeah there's typically those would  be the ones that I'd classify as the  primary so you're either you know these  are traditional Trend following the  interversion Arbitrage is typically  using computers news based you can do  that you sort of still need  now you can still do that based uh you  know discretionary right uh after  trainings announcements you have to be  really quick though and machine learning  essentially you're actually tackling the  thing in Reverse instead of having a  market philosophy and trading uh based  on that you're actually trying to find  patterns in the data and reverse  engineering that without actually an  understanding of why they work that'd be  like Jim Simons and Renaissance Capital  management using machine learning and  all of that so okay so far so good so  let's see if it can give us a very basic  Trend following system in Python give me  a basic Trend following system in Python  using Tesla's  talk as an example  here's a simple example of a trend  falling system  okay we're importing pandas  where do we get the data Tesla CSV we'll  see if we can actually import that  automatically  from my finance  but let's see the moving average rolling  with no size mean where's yep it's up  there trade size by  100 each trade zero shares cash  okay so it's just going to iterate  through and by  after let's see here  so we're just doing is just iterating  through each row which is each day I  would assume if that's daily  um you know saying the trade size is the  shares that's 100 shares how much cash  do we have initial capital  trade size times row close  okay where's the cash yep so okay so  that seems like it seems interesting  um  and then what we do is the current price  is below the moving average the sell the  shares that makes sense okay and then  print the portfolio value okay so let's  instead of using  um you know the CSV let's see if we can  say let's use y Finance instead and then  we'll actually put it into Jupiter  notebook and see if it works all right  so uh give me  um use y Finance in the above instead of  a CSV file  here's an example of how you modify the  trend falling system to use y Finance  import pandas import y Finance ticker  Tesla  period Max  interesting so so far so good let's  actually test this in uh and in jupyter  Notebook which is just you know  web-based way of sharing python code and  see what some of these inputs and  outputs look like right  once this is done  so my initial take so far is if you're a  new Trader if you're a discretionary  Trader and you're interested in getting  into algorithmic trading this is  fantastic  we'll see later if it can exploit like  um post earnings announcement drift and  other anomalies that you know are proven  to work  momentum is one momentum is actually a  very strong  anomaly but anyways I'm digressing let's  just copy this we'll put it in here  Untitled  okay let's just first see if we have  those we'll input get our Imports we do  have it in our python virtual  environment all right let's grab the  data so you can see what that data looks  like  so we see open high low close volume  dividend stock splits I don't know even  though I've created a video on how to  use my finance I use polygon and so I  don't actually use Wi-Fi Finance I don't  know if this is the adjusted close that  incorporates uh dividends and other  corporate actions like splits but you  need to make sure whenever you are back  testing that this is an adjusted close  and not a close otherwise when the price  drops 50 due to split the algorithm  actually thinks that you've lost half  your capital or uh you know had a great  short which indeed it's actually nothing  of the sort all right so then we've got  window size roll uh ma so  all we're doing here is we're creating a  moving average of the close we'll see a  bunch of nands until we get to this  window size of 50 so  on here on the 50th row we'll get  um you know data here and we can see  it's a moving average right here of the  close  okay so far so good we'll set the  initial Capital to 10 000 trade size  it's a hundred  um  set the number of shares up by initial  capital is cash  so that's uh interesting here so  obviously a hundred  so here's here's what I'm looking at  right now right so say 173 why is that  moving average 173 I must have had a big  drop  interesting you'd have to add I'd  actually take a look and check here uh  2022 yeah had a big drop we're in 2022  has been crazy so I was looking at the  data and this is I guess just one of  those things after you've been looking  at it for a while to look and see if the  numbers look normal I see that the  clothes is down here and the moving  average is way up here and I'm like whoa  that's a pretty big drop and then  obviously uh lately uh with all you know  Tesla has been dropping significantly so  I'll assume that that's correct all  right so let's see 110 uh times  100  obviously we know the reason I was  showing you this is uh simply because  this is 11  000 and this is ten thousand so we'll  see we're not going to actually be able  to purchase that initial trade size  um so we'll see what happens with that  so cash is the initial capital is cash  so we've got ten thousand  for index row it arose if the row closes  above the row EMA so if the close price  is above them Ma and shares a zero  shares equal trade size so somehow we're  going to buy  a hundred  so shares is a hundred cash minus trade  size  which would be 100 times row  so  um  okay so let's just do this before we  print the portfolio value I'll run this  and then here's what I was talking about  cash I would I'd be curious uh this you  know if we can go above and below  balances obviously if the trade size is  this much so we're saying the initial  capital is ten thousand but we're  trading this many shares each time let's  see what happens here so there's clearly  a bug in this code where it doesn't  actually check to see if you have the  ability to purchase that much Capital  but for the most part so far you know as  a beginner that's pretty interesting  um so what else could we do  um  give me well we can't do that with  python because you likely don't have the  uh let's see here  give uh give me a  give me when you want give me the python  code to exploit  uh the pad post earnings announcement  drift anomaly uh only where we will buy  immediately at the open  after the first  after  a close above the first five minute bar  um  let's see here selling selling when a  price moves below the 20-day moving  average  I didn't say python uh  oh it doesn't like to exploit  exploit the pet anomaly content but it  still gave it to me anyways let's see  what happens here so if you're not  familiar let me just go to my website  analyzing Alpha  so this is episodic pivot this is a  trade setup where  um you know there's been many of traders  that have turned thousands of dollars  into millions of dollars exploiting this  anomaly and it's based on the post  earnings announcement drift where humans  under react to good information  typically and essentially what we find  is when a company has a really good  earnings announcement price continues to  move in that direction I've detailed how  to do that and some of the trainers who  are successful at making loads of money  off it on this blog post if you're  interested but anyways let's get back  let's see here  I'm going to do so we have Tesla  okay shift five minute bar  well where's the five minute bar  open eye lock  so we don't actually have the data for  that so it looks like it gives us  example code but it doesn't give us  exactly what we need  um  how else could I use this give me uh  your rationale  why the head anomaly Works in stocks  let's see some surface nominal stock  market  okay  yep so it tends to underreact to new  information especially when it's  unexpected  yeah  so this is interesting so here's here's  my initial take  um  I think this is phenomenal for beginners  I think it's exactly sort of what I had  expected it to be from a language model  right it's trained on Wikipedia and  GitHub so it understands you know the  basic stuff  um  it's also interesting because it can  give you give me like give me the top  five Market anomalies  if I could spell  a-n-o-m-a-l-y-s  okay there are many different Market  anomalies are deserved in the financial  markets consider the top ones of course  okay let's see  yeah  Market size value momentum  quality it's going to give me all the  basic stuff  it's momentum  quality I wonder if it'll add the  liquidity  we can defend  effect calendar anomaly okay  so interesting so you know this could be  an interesting way to dig into this  right  um  let me see if it'll give me the code  give me  give me this we don't have the data but  give me the code  the python code  through back test the uh the weekend  effect  the weekend effect is an effect that  it's funny because most companies will  tend to report  poor news or terrible news over the  weekend right if I recall it correctly  it's not one that I use in my trading  but essentially you know you want to  sell on the weekend and buy uh Monday  morning because again bad news comes  over the weekend companies hope that  investors forget about it right  okay let's see weekday shares okay so  it's interesting so so far so good if  you're a new Trader absolutely fantastic  let me go ahead and call it quits on  this one and what I'll do is I'll create  the same thing for non-python Traders  only a little bit different in trading  view if you're interested in that so  hopefully this is informative if you  think that this is it is informative and  you want me to create more videos on  chat GPT  please let me know and we can really  dive in maybe we'll do some type of  Twitter sentiment trade analysis or use  uh you know earnings announcement uh you  know stream you know putting them  through chat GPT and you know combine  price with sentiment to trade uh you  know post earnings so anyways hopefully  you enjoyed this one and I will see you  in the next thanks bye
