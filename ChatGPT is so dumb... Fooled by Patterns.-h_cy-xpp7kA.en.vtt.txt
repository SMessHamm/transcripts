 all right let's talk about chat's GPT  there's been a lot of Hive about this  chat gbt technology it is the AIML model  that provides a dialog problem so that  you can ask it questions and it seems to  respond in a human way but in actuality  I think it's pretty dumb actually and I  think it is way overhyped technology so  I want to explain why and so there's a  lot of reasons but this is one of the  reasons why chat GPT is pretty dumb this  is the iPhone pure magic to many people  they think this is just absolute  Wizardry a magical device a window into  a digital world it's not right it's just  software that looks pretty with nice  animations shiny buttons rounded corners  but it takes a lot of people by hype and  they think that's magical and the same  kind of goes with the hype around chat  gbt let's take a look at this thing chat  jbt optimizing language models for  dialogue so they just reframe  traditional ml models into a dialogue  Manner and you know they can do some  things like they can seemingly correct  code for you it does doesn't have any  comprehension actually it can answer  questions like how do you break into  someone's house how do you protect your  home from burglary these are just some  of the examples that they give you what  this fermaster little theorem and they  can give you kind of a Wikipedia ask  entry here and they can even help you  write a short note to introduce yourself  to your neighbor hi there my name is  so-and-so I just moved the next door  best your name and then you can ask it  to make it more formal as well and it  will spit out this nice piece of text a  paragraph of Words which some people  think is going to revolutionize the  industry and you need to understand that  words text  people don't read anymore okay so in the  world where content is King is this the  king of content text so the way I see it  at least in this day and age we're  talking about the modern day and age not  like 10 20 years ago today there's so  much competition for high quality good  content we're talking about these viral  addictive shorts on Tick Tock moving  videos and images with really well  thought out content that's just made to  go viral is this paragraph of text sped  out by chat gbt which is oftentimes  nonsensical and has no real information  in it is this the king of content or  will people learn to just ignore this  garbage  so maybe it would turn out to be like  those deep fakes from a few years ago  that everybody was so concerned and  panicked about people learn to ignore  those and it became a parlor trick a  little gimmick pretty fun sometimes good  for some memes and I want to talk about  another chat technology Facebook  Messenger Bots if you remember this from  a few years ago people thought Facebook  Messenger Bots these chat Bots would be  the next Revolution and these chatbots  would just talk to you they would be  doing customer service and so the idea  here was that people would chat with  these Facebook Messenger Bots and this  would be the future of UI where people  just typed SMS text messages to a robot  and they would just respond back in a  way that sounded like a human and they  would just abandon the visual UI  interfaces the pictures animations and  videos of their websites their apps  their buttons and they would just be  typing text with their thumbs to these  robots and of course this technology  never took off it never had the chance  but you know people thought it was kind  of cool right it kind of seemed like hey  maybe you're talking to a real human  being what people were actually trying  to do with something similar to WeChat  mini programs so this is the everything  app that Elon Musk wants to kind of turn  Twitter into as well but WeChat is like  this massive massive all-in-one  everything app that has taken China by  storm at least and what makes WeChat so  good and this is what the West has been  trying to catch up with is they have  these mini programs that allow any other  developer product or servers to come in  and build an interface that allows  people to start interacting with the  programs they can buy stuff buy clothes  food strings read menus read reviews get  movie tickets take note however that  none of these mini programs are chat  interfaces actually they're completely  visual it's just called WeChat but it's  got nothing to do with chat actually and  so kind of what happens is all of us  took a look at this and said WeChat hey  it's Chad we need chat we need chat GPT  and we actually made a text interface  chat program when in reality we needed  some visual interfaces here and we just  totally got ourselves confused and quite  frankly this is typical of engineering  Behavior they just start solving  problems without having clarified the  question just because it seemed like an  interesting problem to solve quick pause  this video is brought to you by  techinterviewpro.com learn to land your  dream job at top tier

Google home which is so cool it sounds  human it seems human right maybe it's  human that's so cool Google Assistant  makes the calls seamlessly in the  background for you  so how can I help you hi I'm calling to  book a woman's haircut for our client  um I'm looking for something on May 3rd  still working  [Music]  then you know that none of us care at  all about whether it seems and sounds  human and what we really wanted was just  those WeChat mini programs where we can  just interact with any other service  through just one app which of course  apple is going to make impossible for  the West to develop and on the side note  of course that's because Apple wants  their 30 cut and control of the App  Store but let's take a look at this open  AI stuff and we can see that what  they're doing is they're using this  machine learning model reinforcement  learning from Human feedback system and  they train their model using supervised  fine-tuning using human AI trainers so  there's a bunch of humans who are  actually checking the data and training  the AI for conversations in which they  played both sides of this conversation  so it's not like the machine actually  comprehends what you're saying it's just  mimicking the conversations that those  human AI trainers had with it earlier so  they just gave a bunch of dialogue data  sets and then they mixed this dialogue  with instruct GPT data sets and they  transform the into a dialogue format so  yay now we have a dialog format  interface to this ml model so to me this  kind of goes back to the idea do you  even want a human dialog format  interface with your machine do you want  it to answer your search results with  the right accent the intonations do you  want it to say can you please ask your  question and to answer it in a  human-like Behavior tone or do you not  even care about that just want to click  some buttons now personally for me I  don't care to have a conversational  dialogue with my search engine but hey  maybe you're like the touchy feely type  you want some empathy and you want your  robotic search engine to just be really  nice to you when it's answering your  social results we can see then they use  some machine learning model for proximal  policy optimization and you need to  understand that ml is really just  pattern recognition alright so there's  no real thought or intellect behind any  of this it's just patterns that is  looking for a pattern that looks like it  might be the right pattern that is  trying to match against and once you  understand this then I think you'll  realize that we're nowhere near this  Singularity where we're going to have  this human machine War I mean it would  be cool I would love to have that happen  I would love to see the machines win  quite frankly but I think we're still  quite a ways away from that and by the  way now's a good time to know that yes  even though I worked at Google and  Facebook and I can code it doesn't make  me a machine learning expert okay so I  could be wrong about a lot of my  predictions here but we can see here  that Sam Altman also someone agrees and  Sam outman is like the um  I don't know who he is actually he's  like the founder of Y combinator or  something he says interesting to me how  many of the chat GPT takes are either  this is Agi that's artificial general  intelligence obviously not close LOL or  this approach can't really go much  further trust the exponential flat  looking backwards a vertical looking  forward so he's optimistic but he does  agree that it's kind of a flat looking  curve when you take a look at what we've  done so far it doesn't seem like much  progress has been made the field has a  long way to go and Big Ideas yet to  discover will stumble along the way and  learn a lot from contact with reality it  will be messy there will be bad  decisions and iterative deployment so  this sounds like the skeptical take  although optimistic for the future let's  take a look at the limitations that chat  GPD notes number one it will write the  plausible sounding but incorrect or  nonsensical answers so this is again the  idea that it's just pattern matching but  there's no real General intellect behind  any of this so they know some challenges  here number one is there's currently no  source of truth and that's because one  pattern is as good as another pattern  and there's no real intellect here they  also note that supervised training  misleads the model because the ideal  answer depends on what the model knows  rather than what the human demonstrator  knows so the machine learning model can  only spit out answers that it already  knows but it cannot accept new  information and inputs from the question  so for example if you ask it what's the  economic forecast for 2023 it doesn't  have any training model actually Beyonce  2021 like all of its data is a year or  two old already and it just cannot give  you any new information on the future so  all of the information is just outdated  stuff and it's going to do pattern  matching based on that now chat GPT is  also sensitive to tweaks in the input  phrasing so if you phrase the question  one way it's going to say it can't  answer and if you phrase a different way  then it's going to give you the right  answer now this next limitation is  interesting the model is often  excessively verbose and overuses certain  phrases and the reason is because the AI  human trainers tend to have a bias  towards long answers because long  answers seem right even though sometimes  the right answer is just a short yes or  no the human AI trainers are going to  not use that as model data and so the  result is chat GPT has learned to reject  short answers and only gives you back  long-winded responses that seem and  sound smart and it's just this  pretentious robot in addition the model  never asks for clarifying questions it  just answers every question whether it  knows the answer or not kind of like my  dad so I think it's interesting to take  a look at the visual counterpart to this  stable diffusion part by open Ai and we  can see that for example on a lot of  these AI generated images the hands are  messed up right because the machine  doesn't know how many fingers a human  should have is just doing something that  seems and looks right but the fingers  are usually totally messed up we can  take a look here also at the kanji  character so these are Chinese  characters that it has generated and  these characters are totally nonsensical  they look and seem right but at the same  time each of these radicals which are  the components of each of these  characters are totally nonsensical you  know these aren't just random Strokes  each part has a little meaning usually  now in addition there's also some  potential legal copyright issues with  using open AI Elon Musk noted that he  learned that openai had access to the  Twitter database for their training data  and so he had to put that on pause for  now he wanted to understand about the  governance structure and revenue plans  going forward so this data number one is  not just free for anybody to use right  you need access to high quality data and  Twitter data by the way is not  necessarily high quality either Elon  Musk notes open AI was started as open  source and non-profit neither are still  true today so my take is what this means  for individuals like you and I may be is  that there's going to be licensing costs  data cost and it's not necessarily going  to be accessible to everybody whereas  other Technologies like say building  Facebook apps iPhone apps web 3 apps  anybody could do it then there were  other technological revolutions like say  in machine learning where you just  needed access to so much data that most  normal people didn't really participate  in that right it's not like a normal app  developer is going to be able to do a  machine learning algorithm and come up  with a new algorithm for feed rankings  and so that was something that only the  bigger companies like Google Facebook  Apple Amazon had access to and could  participate in the machine learning  Revolution but normal people like you  and I didn't have access to that data  nor the expertise to train those models  so I think chat gbt and open AI while  there's a lot of potential here is  nowhere near as magical as people are  hyping it up to be and the fact is a lot  of individuals like you and I simply may  not be able to participate in any of  this development because of data  licensing costs maybe copyright legal  restrictions and obviously right now a  lot of us are able to play with this as  a test but it's not like they're going  to open up the API such that we can  develop apps using this for thousands of  queries per day and of course the  quality of these answers the Competitive  Edge for this is going to depend on the  quality of your data and whoever has the  most up-to-date most high quality data  is going to have that edge usually it's  going to be the industry players and you  may want some ml model experts for that  as well so I'm not sure if it's going to  be technology accessible to just normal  individuals like you and I but we'll see  hopefully it is you know in the past  there have been a lot of overhyped  Technologies virtual reality you know  our virtual reality goggles still pretty  low resolution causes dizziness You  Gotta Wear backpacks sometimes augmented  reality we don't seem to have gotten  much further than Pokemon go artificial  intelligence well I guess we've got Siri  and Alexa if you count that as  artificial intelligence where are  talking humanoid robots where are flying  cars remember Clubhouse the audio only  chat room that was going to take the  road by storm and yet the technology  seemed to have come and gone I think the  signal to noise ratio was just too low  on that too many people were just  ranting all the time and ultimately in  this realm of say chat GPT open AI I  think that content continues to be king  because in our current world and when an  attention economy the competition for  high quality content is just stiff and I  don't know if it's sufficient to stand  out if you're just spewing out the  gibberish that's only seemingly and  sounding like it makes sense but it  doesn't ultimately I think humans have a  bias towards unending hope dreams you  know we take a look at animals and  personify them hoping that they're  thinking feeling inside when in reality  they may be feral unthinking beats and  so we do the same two machines as well  hoping that they're intellectual  thinking feeling when in reality we may  have only been fooled by patterns but  I'll do it for me hope you enjoyed the  video let me know your thoughts on chat  gbt open the AI is it the future or just  a gimmick see in the comments below if  you
