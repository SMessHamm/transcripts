 foreign  [Music]  [Music]  foreign  foreign  acceptance  [Music]  hey everyone welcome to the tech capital  of the world I'm Bobby Dave CEO and  founder of coder founder Kevin and we're  living in an AI world right now oh  Skynet here  Skynet is here it's it's over the latest  version  I'm just gonna quit coding now just use  chat chat GPT exclusively  for everything everything yeah we're  gonna talk about some of the stuff you  can use it for other stuff that it  doesn't work for because surprise  surprise it doesn't really work  so here here's I will preface what I I  do say about this stuff it's like it is  impressive okay yeah it's impressive but  um when you say it's gonna replace  developers that is a high high bar  so like literally if you had to like  replace developers with this so I'm sure  there's some like CEO out there is going  to get a startup and he's just going to  complete the chat because they don't pay  developers yeah zap's not going to work  it's never going to work it's never  going to be he's gonna think it's gonna  work this is one of the things that  we'll talk about he's gonna think it's  gonna work  but it's not it's not gonna work you  know yeah  so I mean I think I think it we talked  about this a lot and I have some very  philosophical things about this you know  that I that and I'm trying to figure out  like  I think a lot of the press is coming  from uneducated people like in other  words like well some people who want  coders right we haven't done this for a  minute and it looks at first glance it  like it looks very impressive super  impressive and we'll show some examples  we're going to use yeah so here's my  here's my thing that I think and if  you've been coding for enough and you're  out there and you're listening you're  like yeah I've been on a deaf team you  know exactly the person I'm about to  talk about  and we write about in the book  um which is grumpy coder guy and so  grumpy coder guy will take explicit  instructions from the sales manager or  the product manager or the PM  even the CEO because he hates the CEO he  hates the product manager he hates he  hates the sales team and therefore he  takes explicit instructions from them  and does exactly what they say yep not a  thing more nothing more nothing less no  interpretation it's just exactly as  stated or written or whatever it is yeah  and so you'll get comments from you're  the boss or this is your funeral or like  you know like and I was like he's not  going to put his input into this yeah or  add any value to this whatsoever he's  just going to take the request and then  Churn it out and then the the deaf guy  or the project manager says well that's  not what I wanted I mean that's not what  he says well that's what you said you  wanted you know and so he does and so I  think chat GPT is the evolution of of  grumpy coder guy like it's gonna do  exactly in terms of that yeah it's going  to do exactly what you tell it you know  it doesn't and also the other thing that  I think is misunderstood of which is is  I think the scary part of chat GPD and  this is like ai's in general is they're  completely confident in what they're  doing  like  it's like it comes together  and that was gonna be one of my points  actually about like when you when it  produces an answer it doesn't second  guess its answer at all like it doesn't  say it doesn't even give you like let's  say that you ask it for something and  there could be 10 possible answers it'll  give you one in confidence that that is  the answer the answer it is always the  yeah exactly it comes down to at least  very very you go to stack Overflow you  might get like 10 or 12 in a search  result Google may give you a search  result you may even go to the second  page on a search result because you can  scan through them no no that's not what  I'm quite looking for Yep this one gives  you an answer speaking of stack Overflow  real quick just to cut to this  um  stack Overflow band The GPT answers  for for reasons that we're kind of  talking about here is it's because here  you go uh because  uh what was their actual quote here so  they call it substantially harmful and  it's because  it's  um amount of  um answers incorrect were too high but  they're threshold I guess  um it made too many mistakes  but it was yeah confident yes mistakes  it's confident it's mistakes the problem  with coding in general is mostly working  is broken  and there's very right it can't be a  little bit broken can it a little bit  broken it's broken yeah yeah it's just  broken I mean you know yeah and it  doesn't matter like if if you coded it  90 correct or 95 correct and then like  in some Realms in some areas that's okay  you know like hey you want some 95 as  long as I'm close I'm good and coding  you have to be exact it has to be one of  them is it it's not the second thing  that I think that um that it lacks is  what I'm going to call a word called  discernment  which is the sermon is you're meeting  with a good developer let's talk about  like the good developer that that works  with the staff that doesn't innately  hate the sales staff for whatever reason  right you know um but like so they have  a good working relationship the question  comes in the request comes in and the  good developer goes I hear what you're  saying but and then brings up the cases  why  their their thing needs to be modified  and that's when you have a healthy team  where the developer has an input  into what they're doing and it's  listening to the request realize that  the request isn't like maybe it's not  100 accurate or maybe it lacks some  Nuance or whatever but chat GPT can't do  that it can't like discern  what you're saying you know they're  always like I hear what you're saying  that's not that's not what you want I'm  telling you my experience my things I'm  leading into this I'm telling you that's  not exactly how we want it to work so um  I worked at a company  um well you know and a long time ago and  I probably shouldn't bring this up but I  was asked one time to make a button on a  page okay and the button on a page had a  specific function  well the product team came back and says  you want an American flag on that button  I'm like why do we want to put American  flag on that button like you know like  what's the point and and what we were  looking at was we were looking up  um  how do I say does that saying exactly  who I was working for but like uh we  were looking up things that were Loosely  related to  the U.S treasury okay all right okay and  so they said the treasury Button had to  like have an American flag on it because  the American Flag represents the  treasury and I remember telling them  like well no the American Flag  represents America like nobody he's  looking at this and go oh that's the  treasury button right you know like  right you know so I can remember being  overridden you know and I'm sitting  there telling them what to do it's like  hey no I'm not going to do that I  remember even the first release I  refused to put it on because I thought  it was dumb  you know but then I got overwritten into  some medium says you put that you put  that flag on that but I did and then we  had uh users come back and go what  what's the flag button Ah that's funny  hold on is the fact still on the button  today or did they eventually take it off  I don't know I have to go look but okay  they're like oh you know it's probably  still there they lack self-awareness  when it came back they're like well you  know it's it's the treasury button so  yeah okay interesting I thought it was  kind of funny but um discernment is  something that um like an AI will always  always lack it won't be able to discern  what you're saying a lot of times and  and people look at this when they type  in something in they're like oh it's  Discerning my question it's breaking  apart and it gave me an answer based on  loose  um um a loose description and it's  really not doing that it's it's it's a  really good magic trick you know right  right I put it this way like let's say  that we went to Vegas and we went to the  end of the strip or maybe three blocks  Off the Strip  yeah yeah get off the strip a little bit  and you can see a magician and we're not  magicians and we could be amazed by  they're doing that but Penn and Teller  goes and looks at that and they're like  man he's a third rate hack like that  right that is impressing the  professional no it's not at all and like  Cody's the same way like you know when  you look at some of the code that  generates just like that's just wrong  you know right now I was reading Twitter  before I came here and I do not want to  um out this person on Twitter but this  person supposedly interviews people for  a living okay great and he goes chat GPT  is going to break the interview process  here's my three questions that I always  ask and he puts the question in there  and I phrased it and now it solved it in  three seconds  so the first one was reverse a string  and it was like okay reverse the string  um and he says see it solved and I asked  Virginia developers unless on the second  one he said I give this 2D array and he  had this elaborate thing and he said see  how it solved it in three seconds and he  went on to his thread then the comments  started coming on did you notice that  the answer that it gave for your  question too was wrong  some of the things that we ran through  it  um yesterday when we were talking about  this we're wrong  it had it had an incorrect statement we  asked it to write  um about uh in JavaScript and we'll do  this again today we'll try this again  here in a second actually to write me uh  write me an article about the  differences between uh let and VAR in  JavaScript and it it got part of the  definition wrong it literally explained  it incorrectly but it was very  convincing in the way that it did it  yeah um it basically said what const was  it didn't it didn't know what  consequence and it basically told me  that that a what did it do it said um  when you declare a variable with a let  you can reassign it but with a VAR you  can't  yeah is what it was saying and it was  like well that's just not true but it  was convincing in its answer it  basically stated that as fact and I was  like well as I'm reading through it I'm  like well that's just wrong so we'll see  if it does it today because because each  time you put these prompts into it it  gives you a different answer that's the  other thing it does too it's not  consistent so I feel like if you're  playing  Um poker with chat B Chichi a chat GPT I  can't say that you know and you're  holding a full house and you lay a full  house down the chat do you say two pair  baby freedom and weep you lose yeah  exactly  100. you didn't win you yes I did two  pair baby yeah oh that's that's that's  true it is just like that it is just  like that yeah exactly  um  yeah let's let's talk about a couple  things here first I just want to say  um  funny to say he says you know you've got  to respect the confidence he said give  me the confidence of chap gbt there's a  meme in there somewhere there's a  there's a confidence in Jack GBC meme in  there somewhere yeah Chad GP just fake  it till you make it I mean like it's  literally that guy you know like it's  gonna  definitely tell you definitely here's  something we talked about this morning  Mexico said I was behind this semester  at school and chat gbt saved me in my  final and financial aid for next  semester solved my homework in the same  amount of time it takes to sneeze  we literally talked about this this  morning because we're like man does this  is it does it break education there's  there's a YouTube video in there man  like it might break some forms of  Education I think genuinely it might  because if you have to again I will do  some examples here in a minute but we  can produce a thousand word essay on  Socrates like that and it's actually  pretty good  I'm talking about like without fact  checking it I don't know without fact  checking it it looked pretty good  whether it's yeah you're true I don't  know enough about it to know whether  it's actually 100 true or not but you  know yeah  um here's another post about its  confidence too so Texas said I tried to  ask chat DBT to create an SVG shape out  of the outline of the Mona Lisa it gave  me two rounded cornered rectangles  proudly saying here is trying to be  shape of the Mona Lisa again yeah it  brings up the same point right it's  making a statement just saying like hey  there you go yeah that's he's literally  literally saying so you say there's a  chance so you're saying there's a chance  that's chat GP doesn't take no for an  answer does not take no for an answer  exactly yep that's a great Mona Lisa so  so I think that's the reason is it yes  yes it is yeah you would say yes it is  yeah  better than the original  um  so the fact that you know stack Overflow  Banning it is a thing they recognize  didn't take them long to realize a  couple of days in they're like hey we're  getting a lot of these things post up  here and if we start like fact checking  them they're not entirely correct and  this is something that they actually say  this is not something that chagibit he's  trying to hide open AI isn't hiding the  fact that the tool is going to be wrong  it literally says one of the issues with  the tool is that it will make incorrect  assumptions right yeah I understand this  it's just the user also has to  understand this  you have to understand this going in so  you know just just know that that's know  that that's the case  um okay should we look at some examples  should we look at the tools yeah let's  do it oh here's one thing though here's  one thing I did just to here's one thing  I did use it for and here's one thing  that I think it's great for toddler this  video today chat GPT That's it man we  generated with chat GPD now we tried to  get it to generate the card the  thumbnail we did I tried so I tried to  use and I tried to use  um dally two to create the thumbnail  okay yeah and I fed it in give me a  YouTube thumbnail with the title of the  video right and this is what it came up  with this is one of the this is actually  the best example it came up oh that  that's that's nice right there what is  that I don't know  I gave it the title of the video and  told it to create me a YouTube thumbnail  and this is what it came up with so  there's a computer down here and a desk  that can Klingon is what it did  maybe I should have specified in English  I didn't know how to specify that I  thought that was going to be enough so  yeah the the dally too when it's doing  thumbnails isn't quite there yet so you  can't create thumbnails from it because  I thought oh be good idea let's just  have the AI create the thumbnail and the  title title is okay thumbnail not so  much right  oh no not so much I thought that was  kind of interesting  um so yeah this is anybody who hasn't  used this this is open by the way you  can go use this let's open it uh  chat.openapi.com so it's a  um it's basically an AR that's been  trained on information  um up until 2021 it says limited  knowledge of world events after 2021 so  if you ask it for something after 21 it  might not necessarily know that it's  been trained on a a data set that's free  that so just bear that in mind  um the first thing I'll notice like it  doesn't do very well at like  answering questions about opinions it  doesn't do very well at because it's  saying like hey I'm a non-opinionated  chap right right that's what it tries to  do um so if I ask it like what's the  world's best song right  I tried to get it to answer this earlier  based on just opinion and it actually  won't do this  it'll just say that it's an opinion and  I don't have one basically it's personal  I think this is part of open AI I think  it does have some rules of governance so  like what it's not going to do yes  because but it's about opinions right  here's here's the scary part of this  that the training is what's bringing  into the results out there like that and  people rely on um GPT for their general  knowledge the trainers can dictate  knowledge and I think that's scary  um truth can be changed and I'm getting  very self-phosical at this point but  like if you're relying on these systems  to tell you what's happening yeah then  and you don't and you lack discernment  which I'm saying that it doesn't have  then your view of  the world can be can be shifted by  people that are training the AI to tell  you what's true and I think that's right  that's that's a scary thing with AI  um  they're not going to do that yeah  they're not saying that they're saying  then we don't have an opinion it says  it's a matter of personal opinion so  they're actually and I couldn't no  matter what I put in here I couldn't get  it to answer I was like so what about  like like what people think and you give  me a similar answer so it's like a  similar kind of thing so it won't do  that but what it will do is if I say uh  when we'll get to the code stuff in a  second but if I say  um write five uh tweets about uh C sharp  that are funny  let's try that okay let's see what it  does see let's see if it's actually  funny  um  okay so it's writing the tweets first  one says just realize C sharp is  actually just a sharp version of C no  wonder it cuts through my code so easily  okay yeah funny okay yeah she sharp has  been my guilty language for years but I  heard Java has a softer gentler sound  maybe I'll give it a try and see if it  soothes my soul okay number one was  definitely better than that it's not  even would that be considered funny to  anybody I don't think so I don't know is  it I don't think it is why does c shop  have so many angles  it's like the language was designed by a  geometry teacher  I don't even get that am I missing  something there is that an actual I'm  not am I missing her okay  might not be as funny as some other  programming languages but at least it's  not named after a fruit  might be a school but it's not named  after a fruit hmm  okay there's rust which isn't upgrade  javascript's done is there a fruit  programming language that again Python's  not a fruit that's a snake  um hmm  okay it doesn't work it doesn't work if  you can't remember what the top of your  head it just doesn't work t-shirt may  not be the most popular language but it  is the sharpest tool in my programmers  toolbox I mean okay it's using the word  sharp there I got you I use the word  sharp here and the word shop here so so  it's a terrible this guy wouldn't make  it in the stand did I use any of these  tweets no he's not making enough in the  stand-up world but it might point you in  the right direction so this brings me  back to like one of my things about this  and my overall feeling about this is  that it's just a tool  yeah it's just a tool to give you ideas  it doesn't even give necessarily you  have to give you the answer this might  have like this this this one here I  might be like okay I kind of like what  it's saying there maybe I rewrite it  right maybe there's a different version  of that that I can write that's like  slightly better than the version we put  up here I was like okay this is kind of  cool like this could kind of work  maybe it's not very funny though but no  that's not very funny maybe he doesn't  understand funny I don't know yeah maybe  it needs to have some comedians to come  in and train it up a little bit you know  maybe some good good jokes yeah maybe  um but it's good for things like this  I'm talking about like if you want it to  rise let's let's have it right um  um  this is the part that comes back to the  uh the school part let's do a thousand  word essay on because I tried this  already and this worked very well right  a thousand word essay  on Socrates and then after this once it  writes this which look it writes this  really quick by the way  um yeah  you can ask it to like  change this up too I thought about  something like Okay so this might be  like  maybe this is like a written at a  college level right but what if I'm like  what if I'm in fifth grade and I'm like  I probably wouldn't come up with the  same level of detail  right because I didn't actually read  through one of these and it was actually  pretty good and it like and this is  different than the one I asked for  earlier yeah it does it does change it  up it just changes ever so slightly  although I will say I noticed the first  two lines are the same written with  different language so we'll talk about  who that it was a philosopher in Western  philosophy and when they were born and  where they were born so this one all  this always says that it was born in  Athens sometimes it says Athens Greece  sometimes it says the actual year that  he was born sometimes it'll say a date  range for born sometimes it'll say the  century he was born so so you know could  you cheat with this maybe  um maybe but I've also got to say that  if you're  a college professor  he's gonna see a bunch of these come in  in this same format you're gonna start  noticing them I think I think it's not  smart enough to give it to me but  um what if I say rewrite this as a fifth  grader  now here's the part where it keeps up  context so it knows the previous one  exactly that's kind of cool so I don't  have to tell it to rewrite what it knows  I'm rewriting a thousand word essay  about Socrates so it says now I'm  writing as a fifth grade and look at the  language it used  mm-hmm while it's writing that Socrates  was a famous philosopher who lived a  long time ago in Greece so it was way  less specific and it used words like  famous and it just used long time ago  you know context of a fifth grader is  different than context of Sony College I  was like wow okay that's actually pretty  smart  um so you can use so you can use  previous context and you can actually do  this with code too so if I reset this or  shall we have it right let's have it  write some some code we try Fizz Buzz  yesterday fizzbuzz is kind of  interesting let's have it right Fizz  Buzz  um  because we can pick this apart pretty  well  um in just just in JavaScript right  let's let's just start with that  there we go so it wrote my logic using a  uh using a loop  uh actually using an if statement  and it basically described fizzbuzz to  me so  technically yeah this would work right  use the for Loop use some if statements  for the for the results and it logs out  the result yeah  so let's get it to see if we can alter  it to to change the upper bound  again  um  sure what language do you want me to use  here use JavaScript we need to change  that no no I'm saying like how would you  want it to tell me to do that what are  you I don't know I just don't want 100  to be the the heart okay okay  um let's do uh loop up to 200. let's see  if it does that  if it understands what that means  well let's see no typos I've actually  tried it with typos intentionally  displacing letters and things it  actually did pretty good there you go  it's gonna work look  okay  oh so it just gave me the um hold on um  okay so let's do update the previous  let's see if we can do this  previous code  I think it's still working you did say  the previous example yeah  it's actually still working now make the  upper bound  [Music]  um  yeah maybe if that's working is it  working on that no well it seems to be  still working on this it seems to be  stuck so here's the issue with this um  just in general is that it's  um it gets stuck it gets stuck um and  it's because the amount of people that  are using it that's why  um they actually they took it down for a  while yesterday while we were messing  with it  um you know they have like a massive  amount of of users  um  see where it does this time I'll see you  go it really changed it a little bit  look so it says this time just to do  something with I which is interesting  um yeah to make the upper lemon and  fizzbuzz variable  so hold on so so to do that we need to  take an input right so yeah we need to  think about that that part of it uh yeah  allow the user to input the upper bound  okay  just buzz  yeah actually I'll fix my typo let's see  what that does  so this we haven't told it to create a  user interface at all yet for this yeah  so let's just see if it actually  understands like that it needs to create  a user interface in order to as we're  saying user input now  um  I think it will  but here's the thing right if you just  got this back and you change this like  this you still have to have some  understanding of how to plug this back  into this right there's still context  here you have to understand  yeah I think maybe it's like  oh no here we go  okay it just didn't know that you're  talking about um fizzbuzz still it lost  its contact yeah I think it lost its  context I think it lost the um yeah yeah  hold on here's what we're gonna do we'll  refresh this what in the world is that  mess that it put there number prompt  okay  I don't know we'll come back let me let  me reset this hold on let's do  um right Fizz Buzz let's let's be more  specific this time uh in JavaScript  um  uh with a uh let's say an HTML and CSS  front end  to accept user inputs  for  um  the upper limit  yeah does that work yeah right Facebook  and JavaScript HTML CSS front end to  accept user inputs for the upper limit  let's see what it does  start okay so it's writing some HTML  writing some CSS a little body tag  inline styling look  button  I'm back to what is that doing here in a  second  so it's got a button and an input  and then wrote a script tag  grabbing the elements look too to push  them into the JavaScript  and then it  we'll go back and read and see what this  does here in a second see this actually  works  and so we have to push that into fias  code at this point to try it out yeah  yeah that's the thing you can try it  here yeah there's a copy code button I  can hold on let me uh  we're testing it now I can uh vs code  yeah  see I'll have to move this over in a  second here yeah  do a folder you should be able to just  put it in there as it is and then just  right click and run it yep I just need  to uh  according to chat here chat boy  represent a new fold what am I going to  call this uh chats GPT  I think I've got this  let's do a new scholar  index.html yeah  and then just paste it in there  right click and see if you can right  click on the index HTML yeah there you  go all right it ran  okay  so you just want to try and brand luck  yeah random interface let's just  generate look at that okay  it worked  all right I mean let's try uh  200 to see if that works  it worked  um yeah would it pass a cutter founder  no  yeah no but from from a technical  standpoint you've started off with  something that kind of like it works  right it's giving you a little it's  giving you some styling it's actually  it's funny because it it's it's weird  because it says it's not opinionated  about things but it's added a Sans serif  font like and it scented it so like why  did it do that where does that come from  why did it choose like the button that  it shows why did it choose the font  sizes that it shows yeah it's clearly  opinionated about some things why is it  using pixels in that rooms  I don't know what we can change that we  can change that but then it styled it  look it gave it it gave it an H1 wrote a  prompt into a number yeah to generate  um  so it added an input added a button and  then uh the results for the  um yeah was not bad on the UL there yeah  yeah  but instead of a div but yeah unless it  wrote lies let's see if it wrote lies  out there uh that's how it did it yeah  it did to use allies yeah yeah okay  all right so it's um it writes pretty  good comments too look I didn't comment  the HTML yeah but it did comment the uh  the JavaScript registrator asked Tennis  Center a div or let's find out I mean he  did didn't it I mean it did that's not a  div let's see if it could center a div  and a page so let's just see how would I  because now we're testing that yeah just  try again we'll just do uh reset it just  make sure it loses its complex okay what  am I asking you to do  horizontally and vertically Center a div  okay  that's a text okay text hello world okay  on a web page I guess on a web page okay  it's a refrigerator we're testing this  now yeah okay let's see what it does  and then we'll paste that into ourselves  and see what it does  it's going to blow up now because we  know that this is too hard for anybody  it's just it's going to run off and  think about this one for like a while  it's like it's gonna be like whoa hold  on a second  um Tailwind bootstrap flexbox what do I  do well this is this is true because you  can actually tell it to use whatever you  need to whatever it comes up with here  um oh is it actually gonna give us code  I don't think it is I think it's just  going to give us a wow so hold on we  need to oh it is here we go  oh wow  it hasn't given us a con oh has it hold  on let's see  wow let's run a book on this  okay so we didn't let's let's see what  it is it didn't really do it I mean like  that can kind of work so like if you  type in div on a page with that that CSS  yeah  um it might work right is that what we  want to try here and then there's this  other one that here's the next example  here's an example how to use a margin to  Center the div it gave us two ways to do  it  okay  um let's let's specify uh use flexbox  use flex bikes all right so let's see  what it does  oh  sorry  I expect this to try this then not retry  that I don't think it finished I think  that's why  so beginning programmer says we're doing  it wrong Kevin  why why why are we doing it wrong there  we go use flexbox  he says I think these queries are weird  ask it to make the page then add the div  with maybe some details then keep adding  incrementally going there with the mega  queries are bad in my experience  okay  refrigerator said I had to go ask his  manager how to do it  that's true so this this kind of work I  mean there's no it doesn't get it didn't  give me the original content that I  wanted but that's okay okay so let's see  what it did here let's see if it worked  so like I can tell you but like um we'll  try it out so this game is two CSS  classes which we have to infer that's  what it's doing which which one do you  want to try from the top no flexbox you  have a body tag and a div tag so you  need both of those  and then um  let's see if we can make it hold on let  me go to uh let me clear out your page  just delete it all um  I can use everything but  let's  you can put your Styles in that tag yeah  right  how they did it there  and then there's a body tag too that it  had  it  yeah I had two tags they gave us so  we're using both  up above it  oh this one too oh okay well that's the  body so it's it's certain the body on  the page and then the div is in that so  we'll see what it does okay  and then we'll just put in there  get my uh  there you go now write a div and say  Hello World say div hello world in there  and let's see what it does  should work  uh  there goes it's centered a div there we  go  which you would expect it to uh using  that using that code is pretty  straightforward you would think that's  what it would be yeah  it's kind of cool  yeah  interesting  um yeah so you can um I think for some  things like it kind of work so let's say  let me go back to something we asked it  for yesterday because I thought this was  interesting  um yeah  write an article about  um JavaScript  let versus VAR yeah  um  let's just do let over  I spell that right yeah  [Music]  because this is one thing where I've  seen it did make an error but I've also  seen where it'll it'll actually rewrite  stuff too and it's actually learning at  the same time by the way if you notice  here there are some thumbs ups and  thumbs down so it's it's actually still  learning which is interesting  um as people are  saying like it is  [Laughter]  um yeah  this is a a car scanner first you're  sitting to do this next we're stealing  nuclear codes  we haven't tried to hack anything with  it yet we could say you know hack now  it's I saw uh some feedback talking  about it  um having kind of  um sort of moral boundaries  so we can I don't want to overly test  that but you know no we don't either  uh let's see  the one I asked for yesterday he  actually gave me a code examples too yes  if he gives us a code example  this is I don't think this is gonna give  me a  this is very different than the one I  asked for yesterday too so  a lot more text than what I asked for  yesterday okay maybe it's learned since  yesterday maybe the javascript's program  range is widely used on the web for  creating interactive and dynamic  websites okay  Concepts is a concept of variable  declarations which allow developers to  create variables that can be used to  store manipulate data  in JavaScript there are two main ways to  declare variables  so there's your first  but look how confident it is I know yeah  yeah this comes back to that confidence  like there are two main ways it's not  like it's not like it's having a guess  it's stating there are two  um yeah I guess you could argue that  const isn't a variable maybe I don't  know there's maybe it's making that  argument subtly I don't know yeah let's  let's look at beginner programming is  very opinionated on this put his last  comment up there before we read this uh  hold on I gotta go back to this  the last the last comment this one yeah  the last one I think is funny he's like  six words explained especially  look at the dude like you're not a  programmer man look at how you're built  there's no way you're a programmer  you're not coding  oh it's funny  um  yeah and that's the other thing too  there's many ways to put this stuff in  here that's yeah that's kind of a that's  kind of a thing right I I I get that  um and you have to kind of be like I  don't know it's supposed to use common  language so for me it's like yeah the  only difference between your option and  mine was just like I didn't tell it how  many words that's the only difference  yeah yeah you know  um  and again this same this same writing  prompt will give different results each  time too so yep  um  yeah so without going through this in  detail I'm trying to see if it tells you  the same thing it told me that was wrong  yesterday because there was more than  one thing that was wrong  um so it seems like it's repeating  itself a lot though it does it does a  little bit of that here's what also I  noticed the last paragraph when you  asked to write an article it always  gives you this in conclusion paragraph  yeah um this is going to be a sign that  people are going to be looking out for  in the future they're going to notice  like oh hold on a minute you're uh I see  what's happened here this is a chat GPT  answer isn't it  variables cannot be redeclared within  the same block  of our variables yeah which which is  different than what it told me yesterday  yeah  so you know I don't yeah so you do have  to like  yeah so enough to say that could you use  some of the information that's in here  and use it as a basis to write an  article for this sure you have to triple  check every single word that it says yes  100 I don't think and I do think people  are going to do this I think people are  going to write a technical blog starting  they'll come out they probably oh  they're already out there 25 writing  prompts and then just post those  directly to it and like it's gonna be  wrong ten percent of the time in every  article yep  yep no  so here's what here's what we'll do look  here's what's going to happen give me  five technical blog ideas then we're  gonna take one of these and actually  have it write the thing so common  pitfalls to avoid when implementing what  what do we want to put in here  uh oh we have to insert the technology  yeah yeah yeah let's be more specific  yeah so common pitfalls when  implementing.net C sharp oh C sharp C  sharp yeah  okay  um right a let's do a thousand word  article  to be a little bit  um yeah common fit Force to avoid we  didn't really see Sharp  see what we get  it's doing uh it's labeling them look  too for number one  I like that interesting is it gonna come  up with another one though that's Lizzy  gonna have Pitfall number two because if  it doesn't it's gonna be a bit weird  isn't it  you put too many words in this thing now  I gotta read a thousand words  I just want to see how much it can like  oh it's his using like number two  misusing the for each Loop we'll read  this one I'm interested in this oh it  gives you code example  hold on so Pitfall number two misusing  the four each  another common Pitfall for c-sharp  developers is misusing the for each Loop  the for each Loop is a convenient way to  iterate over a collection of items okay  true  such as an array or a list however there  are some important things to keep in  mind when using the four easily first  the 4-H Loop is designed to be read only  okay okay this means that you cannot  modify the collection that you are  iterating over with the for each Loop  for example the following code will  generate an error  who's trying to make an assignment  during the foreign that's not true is it  I don't know that's just not true is it  you can make an assignment during a for  each Loop right you can assign it's not  read only right  I'd have to get tested you could Loop  over something right you could Loop over  something and you could you could change  the value for everything that you Loop  over right you could you could read the  the  value and then rewrite it right I'm not  so in here so let's say we have a four  each Loop and I'm looking in in this  example right for each in in the numbers  this in this array  in this Loop could I rewrite these  numbers in this array did I change them  you can't you can't like like it's what  it's saying is the collection error  numbers can't be changed  okay you might think you are but you're  not like this this oh I see what you're  saying I okay okay yeah get modify this  collect this numbers okay and you're  like you could  okay and I think the reason is because  it's keeping up with accounts and things  like that right beforehand when it  allocates it  I guess because I stopped it scrolling  too by the way it actually cuts it off  what was point one I'm interested in  that not understanding the difference  between value and reference  so you just the bottom line is you just  have to read through this stuff to make  sure that it's always accurate  yeah and then  here's so here's the thing you have to  know whether it's accurate or not well  you do so you're gonna have to learn how  to code like I'm just saying like you  know you're just gonna have to know how  to do it this comes back to your point  around like  um uh having to having to be the pen and  Teller in this situation yeah because if  you're not the pen and Teller if you're  just the average yoshimo in the audience  who doesn't understand the trick that's  happening you're going to be wowed by it  yeah so let's talk about some things  that it cannot do today no matter how  much we type in this thing I'm gonna try  you know even if beginning programmers  typing it in for us it won't do this I'm  gonna try so like I think one of the  problems it's gonna have first off when  we we talk about making an application  in general like a whole application  which is a UI HTML it's the back end  code whether that's c-sharp JavaScript  it's written on a specific framework  that could be node that could be hp.net  um and then we have to create that  solution which it probably could  generate something for us and say we  modify it and then we need to publish it  it's not going to be able to publish it  and then the other thing that comes in  that people that it lacks Nuance is like  in the environment that I'm in the uh  the solution will change like in other  words like you know like I get the code  out there and it kind of works so like  when you use stack Overflow yeah you're  bringing stuff in you're cutting pasting  it in but then you you have a whole  context of what I'm trying to do and it  just it's never going to have  that kind of context I mean could you  get really good at typing it in enough  to where it could do it here's the other  thing let's say it generates an app for  you and let's say that it works but then  you show it off to upper management  comes back because I need you to make  these three changes but you don't know  how to program  okay you're not a programmer at this  point you're gonna have to get it to um  to to do it it's kind of an application  and so you won't be able to like change  your solution because you won't  understand what it's doing the second  thing is is when it's broken  how do you fix it like when it does make  a mistake which it does quite often yeah  what do you do if you're not a  programmer you have to understand it  yeah that's the thing you really have to  be able to understand what it's  producing at the end of it yeah because  you could submit like  like if you're if you ask it to do Fizz  buzz and it's like and it gets kind of  the  the algorithmic part right or a version  of the algorithmic book right but you  don't know how to implement it or do  anything with it it's like it's useless  the mistakes are going to become  self-aware right now Kevin you're gonna  you're gonna do it let's see the giant  robot I mean come down the hallway here  and start shooting up people you know it  makes me wonder yeah it makes me wonder  what it what I  what what it thinks I'm asking like what  is it actually gonna come up with me  what is it actually gonna tell me  um really thinking about it it's  actually going to fail in a second it's  going to uh  to fail  and then I'm going to have there you're  going to have to redo it look this is  just because there's a lot of people  using it yeah  oh here you go  I can't do scan it says  you're the same  you are okay so NC 17 hero says ask if  it's worth building a bug tracker in  2023. oh no so let's see  doing a bug tracker in 2023  let's see  it doesn't  needs more information  tell you what a bug tracker is  type of software okay a number of  depends on number factors like I don't  really know  um so I'm just not gonna answer  I mean because this is like a non-answer  isn't it the decision to build a bug  trying to depend on specific  circumstances and goals of the  development team  yeah that's the uh that's the that's  that's just that's the things that you  get in the meetings from the the meeting  guy you know the Mini Guy this is  meeting guy right here answering this  question you know  it comes off confident you know well  that's going to depend on a number of  facts exactly but it's such a non-answer  that's a long answer like you have a  hold on I need a natural answer I don't  need you to talk around the actual  answer yeah  what else what I should ask it something  like what project should I put on my  portfolio let's try that  maybe get better at  um we're gonna have to be more specific  about this so we're going to say web  developer portfolio  mm-hmm  oh okay  we can definitely evaluate the whole of  this one  um  okay so as a web developer you probably  should showcase your skills and  accomplishments in a way that is  relevant to potential clients or  employers okay some projects that you  may want to consider adding to your  portfolio include websites web  applications generic  um that you have built from scratch  including any custom features or  functionality that you have implemented  okay I don't know what you would do with  that but sure I mean again because I  should put a website on it thanks yes  exactly examples in your design work  wireframes mock-ups finish designs for  websites or web applications sure if  you're going for designer front-end that  could be useful uh case studies or  documentation of your development  process including information about the  Technologies and tools you used and then  the challenges you faced and how you  overcame them I like that I like that  it's not bad testimonials are feedback  from clients or users of the websites or  applications you have developed fair  enough yeah okay any relevant personal  projects or open source contributions  that demonstrate your web development  skills  okay it's kind of generic in his answers  isn't it it's not it can't be specific  I love that sense  which that was written by a lawyer  remember the projects you choose to  include in your portfolio should be  tailored to your specific goals and  audience  it doesn't really tell you anything you  know no that's yeah I think a lot of  this doesn't it's not it's non-specific  isn't it I mean this this alone is just  the most I feel like it's alarm Epson  generator and sometimes yeah so yeah see  this answer is just like the most  generic answer ever because this could  be tic-tac-toe I mean this could be like  this could be a web page that says hello  world on it like you know what I mean  that's not very good advice to put on  your portfolio is it  yeah you built it from scratch it's got  a bunch of custom features I made them  it's it's hello world  it sounds like every British politician  it's like every politician every  politician where you are in the world  yeah yeah  it's true that's true  okay all right my conclusion about chat  um chat GPT is I think it can help you  with code suggestions code Improvement  um I think it has a long way to go  before it replaces developers yeah um  and even then I don't think it ever will  I mean someone's saying they could do it  decades  okay if it's decades let's say it's  decades means more than 10 years so like  20 years  you should should you learn coding right  now if you're 20 years old  and say you're going to be replaced in  the next 20 years I think that's a good  safe bet you know um but I don't think  that it'll ever get there like  there's so much to this  that once you start really digging into  this problem it becomes increasingly  increasingly difficult to solve like and  that's why things like creativity  insight and the other one that I wanted  to go into is empathy which is like an  AI will never have empathy where they  um empathy is like you share the pain of  someone else and so like when you're  working in a company you know and you  and you guys are working the company and  you're like invested in the company you  want to see it succeed you have empathy  to the plight of your co-workers you  know like in other words like hey let's  make this happen and then you may do  more or do extra or provide more insight  because  you know the other thing is creativity  is or necessity is the other word that  I'm looking for is like necessity is the  mother that I mentioned  um an AI will never have to do something  yeah it has to be told it has to be yeah  it never like has a need for anything or  anything like that you know so like the  the need for it to build something will  never come across it's my you have to  tell it it doesn't have needs or wants  or desires and therefore  those things that we undervalue in the  way the human brain works it's it's  critical now I'm not saying that um a  lot of people feel like you don't have  those but you do you do you just use  those to make decisions you know  um you just do every day and then the  need to do it is  far outweighs sometimes more than the  actual skill of doing something  you know you invent things you solve  problems when you have to so I can  remember and I'm gonna true example is  I'm not a plumber but like my basement  flooded one time because of this this  thing broke okay I'm standing in like  um you know calf weight calf deep water  I remember I had to fix it  the Plumber's not coming there's no one  coming to the rescue and I had to like  fix it and I did I mean you know I'm not  saying that it was the best plumbing job  ever but I had to get water through that  pipe and out of my basement because you  know I was drowning everything so yeah I  fixed it but so necessity is a mother I  mentioned an AI never has that need it  can never have a fear a want or desire  so never invent things like you never  will like you have to express your need  to it and then it can give you something  back that's the that's how it's How It  kind of works but but that requires  somebody to express the need to it right  and I look at this our classic example  we talk about Skynet we talk about the  Terminator and we always talk about like  the the robots taking over the world but  if you really look at let's take  Terminator one the movie class example  of AI so Arnold Schwarzenegger's  character just marches through town  shooting everything it's it's it doesn't  try to hide its intentions it just does  stuff you know and like like a smarter  assassin would have like been more  nuanced about how we're going about  killing the girl you know  yeah exactly well even then it's still  just marching through stuff you know  like it leads and it always ends up  destroying itself because it doesn't  know that it should stop or should ever  stop or or there's a reason why I can't  stop it's completely confident I'm a  bulletproof Terminator no one can kill  me yet it dies in the end because you  know it doesn't have any of those things  so uh I think that's the problem like  it'll just keep on writing code it'll  keep on putting it out there  all right hey Bree thanks man you're  dead out for us let's see yeah yeah  let's see I mean uh Supreme says  enjoying working with bootstrap five  uh I heard someone say that it slows  down your sight and doing a chrome speed  test it will tell you the file is too  big any thoughts  all right I don't think so I don't think  that it slows down your site I mean uh  um you have to use CSS for something  I don't know what file is is talking  about I guess it's talking about the CSS  the bootstrap CSS file  babe I mean I'll just have to look at it  and see yeah yeah ah yeah I've not come  across that  um what if you just  um attached it through a CDN then the  file wouldn't be big  right but even if you did it it's not a  massive file is it  well I mean yeah like so like you know  there's some of these Lighthouse people  say you know if it's more than 500k  you're in trouble and like oh yeah yeah  yeah yeah yeah so like I'm not in  trouble man like you know but um I don't  I don't think so I mean the the question  I would ask though is like once when I  hear this it's like what is our  alternative what are we gonna do I could  write all the Cs by hand and maybe save  200k or something like that because I'm  only using the stuff that I want is  something you you could think about  doing it you know so if that's a big  problem and that's really the problem  causing your site not to be fast  I don't fastest relative to this is the  thing we're talking milliseconds it's  like milliseconds on this just the CSS  part typically you have a lot of other  problems you know maybe a bad  algorithms  low or yeah there's a lot of things that  goes into a bit faster I don't think  that um I would not avoid bootstrap  because someone said it's going to slow  down your site that's not I don't think  that's against it and there is this yeah  yeah there's this minified version  that's right yeah  this is also a problem I think the  Tailwind tries to solve too right  because it builds that it builds out a  custom uh CSS file if basically if you  use the class it puts it in if you don't  use it it doesn't include it that is one  of the good features of Tailwind but  ramping up to get Tailwind working is  just like it's a lot more work it's just  that doesn't work here's the thing  that's happening with Tailwind so now  that tailwind's out now you're starting  to see component sites come out like oh  here's my list of Tailwind components  and you're like okay that's bootstrap  that's what boots are been having and  they're more tested than yours this is  what you've been complaining about the  decision exactly yeah opinionated  components so like well yeah but I want  to write an accordion I know that's my  point we don't want to so like you know  um so I think I think all of these  things  um I I really believe that whether you  still want to bootstrap  um for Speed wise for most applications  is irrelevant  I don't think that's that's a problem so  you don't have 100 Lighthouse score  so what  but you know not everything can be a  static website either so like you you  know that's not usually the goal right  you know I'd also say if you're building  something for yourself too just use the  CDN like I understand  but like the CDN works it's fast  um if you're not building like an  Enterprise anything like sure if you are  then I'm sure there's ways to optimize  for bootstrap right yeah  stuff so yeah yeah but um if it's just  for yourself I wouldn't have an issue  using the CDN and the CDN does take a  load off your site so yes it is a  dispensive the CD ends now but in  general the cdns are spreader all across  the internet and people use them all the  time and and it makes it quick so I  think it can work either way  yep definitely  one last thing to put in chat gbt what  do we want to put in before we go let's  give it one last thing one last thing  we'll see we'll take some comments and  tell us what you want us to ask it  people something about tacos what's is  it gonna something it can't be oh I know  I know uh  a good chicken taco  recipe  c-i-p-e  something like that oh I misspot it  anyway it doesn't matter it knows it  anyway it doesn't matter  okay  there we go oh it gave us a seasoning  it's a comments onion powder okay it  went corn tortilla okay so it did do  corn not flour okay yeah yeah yeah which  which lettuce lettuce is good tomatoes  but the cheese I'm done with the cheese  the salsa and the sour cream man I mean  you know  cut the chicken into small bite-sized  piece and placement oh at the olive oil  taco seasoning stir evenly bake 15 to 20  minutes  okay  while the kitchen is [ __ ] warm the  tortillas in the oven are on the  stovetop boy you do that at the very end  your chicken would be very dumb by the  time you're warm when you're yeah  right uh several attackers  okay so really enjoy Okay cool so I  think sour cream is a mistake for a true  I don't know in the style of  street food okay in uh uh let's do uh  see if that makes a difference  same recipe but with smaller corn  tortillas and tough tigers with  additional ingredients so okay there you  go cilantro lime wedges there we go now  we're talking yeah yeah now we're  talking much better  carne asada honey this okay okay cool I  like it  yeah I wonder if it's the new um this is  the new um uh I definitely think it's  been it's gonna be used for recipes but  the problem is it doesn't give you it  gives you one recipe  um and it's yeah but that's it it's not  necessarily um  I guess you could ask for three okay I'm  just gonna say you could ask for three  yeah yeah I'm gonna I'm gonna slap it  again actually gonna use my typo again  because why not but I wonder if it's  gonna give me a different different  recipe  um yeah because in previous when I asked  if previous writing prompts it did give  me different things every time  um which which is interesting  that's gonna be the same recipe hasn't  it I mean  yeah I don't think those are very good  um this is exactly the same look  yeah  yeah I don't think those are good  I'm just telling you man Abel's Abel's  Grill here in Kernersville North  Carolina has the the  he has the secret if I could um it is  uh no oh maybe oh I wonder if we could  do like um  um  a Chipotle now okay if you guys for like  specific like store recipes like that  could be kind of interesting what's the  recipe for Chick-Fil-A nuggets yeah  exactly I wonder if it would know that  hold on do you know the ingredients of  Coke do you know I'm just wondering if  it would  oh that's a guarded secret man oh  I wonder if that's it telling me how to  make Coca-Cola is that is that weird  like  hey you have if you solved it maybe if  somebody could go try this this would be  great so a couple of sugars some  caffeine citric acid vanilla caramel  lime and lemon and some water  somebody somebody wants to make this and  send this my way I'll uh I'll give it a  taste test on stream you're gonna boil  this look from over a medium heat  interesting yeah so anyway chat GPT  interesting stuff all right so one  question for the road someone wants to  know what happened with the power outage  in North Carolina crazy story oh yeah we  were talking about this the other yeah  we had a student we had a student that's  in uh Morrow County and then that's true  someone who actually wasn't someone it  was a group of people and more than one  location  um used a gun to shoot up some  substations that took out power for 40  000 people or so something like that  making our state look great  yeah so like they basically took a a  truck and rammed through the gate it  looked like and then shot it up  and I guess the substation caught on  fire and that cut out the power yeah and  they had a bunch of speculations as to  as to why but they haven't actually we  haven't come back around to the story  yet have they to say exactly why but the  FBI are involved so I did see that so  it's like hopefully we find out  eventually what what that deal is but  man it's fragile man that's a week  that's what we took from it like it's  fragile we gotta be we gotta be careful  I don't know what we'd be doing no I  don't know man would be lost at this  point which by the way speaking of  losing chat gvt when it was down  yesterday I joined their Discord there  were people raging over the fact that it  was down they were Rich hold on a minute  it's only been around for a week I mean  like just no way that you have this  built into  it like you need already like it's been  out for a week and you're raging that  you can't use it today like come on  people here's here's what I will tell  people I'm going to give you some  examples and I think we're going to  think of one but I do think where chat  GPT has its largest potential isn't  about you writing code with it I don't  think that's the biggest potential I  think it's about using that potential  creating an app that needs that  and so writing code around this and  using it to do things is kind of cool so  I do think that you could have like an  extension of Visual Studio that writes  some more specific templates yes and  using Jack TP chat GPT to help you write  better templates  um or maybe more generic templates maybe  they're focused on certain industry or  they're focused on a certain  um you know sector of the economy I  think that's that's the way it's going I  think this gets built into other tools  it gets becomes part of an IDE because  we talked about this before too yeah  visual studio right now as an IDE has  some of this kind of built in this it  does yeah it's a scaffolding it does  like templates it does like these yeah  cookie cutter things that it creates  already for you right and then there's a  temple in the T4 template that you can  create things to extend Visual Studio to  do certain things I think this is the  next iteration of that where it's doing  some more code Generation  Um I do think there's maybe an  abstraction layer between things that  are done the same every single time I  mean I think that is kind of like where  the use is for will it ever be able to  generate an application from scratch I  don't think so yeah certainly not in  this iteration not the way as it is now  um you could iterate over something to  get closer to building out a simple  application but it could never do like  we talked about it could never do  Integrations with  um with web and uh uh uh with um hosting  and with apis and with all of these  other things that are like third party  like pulling into it it could never do  it you data do that that's the job of a  developer that's what it's about yeah  that's a team of people and I I you know  so like it can solve small things that  are well defined maybe maybe write a  specific algorithm that does something  but then you've got to integrate the  algorithm into it and then you also have  to check it to begin with to see if  they're even right writing the code is  just one part it's just one thing just  one little bit of the whole  um bundle of being good I do think the  people that are out there saying that  hey this is going to replace our job  don't learn the code I and I'm not  insulting anyone if you're saying that  I'm just saying that  become more educated about like what it  really means what does a developer  really doing like there's a lot of  things that it's really doing and um  saying that you can replace it by  answering in a bunch of prompts and it  does generate code I still think you can  build Twitter or Facebook or Google with  chat GPT like only like like just  imagine if that's the tool you had  that's all you had and you had to use  what it gave you  I think your product fails every time  yeah this is going to take creativity  you wouldn't get to a point where you  could  it could solve an individual problem of  whatever that individual like encoding  problem is or something like in code  videos and like okay I can do that but  then you've got to implement that into a  bigger application it's like an  application something like Twitter  solves a thousand problems right and  it's weird  doesn't understand the other 999  problems that it's trying to integrate  with it only understands the one you're  asking it to do yeah in the 10 000  Frameworks that you're using you know  maybe they're using a certain framework  for real-time communication maybe single  hour websites whatever they're doing  this part's written in JavaScript this  part's in something else and using graph  GL for this and like there's just a lot  of things that goes into an app that um  you just can't solve with chat GTP  that's why when people say it's going to  replace developers I think it's the  Press looking at this like wow that  generated us some code well because it  looks like magic yeah does it work I  mean like you know pin and Teller is  looking at that that's not a good trick  I mean you know yeah  um so I think I think that's my uh  ultimate thing on it now can it get  there every 10 years will it improve  yeah but the problem is the things that  we're doing is getting more complex as  we go so it's always going to be in this  ketchup game  um because the the AI has to be trained  and it has to be trained you know if you  guys ate today what's the current  version of.net it's not going to tell  you that you know yeah that's the thing  it actually isn't Magic  it's just it's been trained so it might  look like magic it might appear to be  smart but it's not smart and it's not  Magic  right it is trained it is trained on a  on a on a set of information and can it  keep learning sure but even this one  that must be a problem for them because  they've trained it through data through  2021 and it's like while it knows  something's passed then it doesn't know  everything past then so I'm guessing the  training part of it must take a while  because we're talking about something  that was like that's at least a year  it's probably 18 months because they say  2021 we're in the end of 2022 so it took  a minimum a year for them to get to the  point where they released it so it's you  know there's some issues there it's not  it's not everything you can look at like  video game AIS you know when you're  shooting monsters with a gun they always  train in front of your gun you know no  matter what they do they just run  straight at you and like it doesn't  matter which one you're playing and it's  just like you know that's what the  Terminator does in the movies he just  just marches straight forward you know  I'm bulletproof and he's not he ends up  getting boiled in a pit of lava you know  it just ends up dying what do you think  one last thing remember this if you're a  new hire you can copy the code and ask  it to explain what's going on so you can  focus on implementing the right solution  instead of learning every intern  spaghetti code well the problem is is  that when you get on a job it is  spaghetti code it always is I mean like  everyone like complains about that but  that's the thing software projects grow  over time and you implement Solutions on  top of Solutions on top of solution so  you have to understand what they're  doing like and that takes a coder that's  what coders do like read the code tell  me what it's doing why did you do this  like what what are we using for database  access you know  um so GPT team we only know about Dapper  well we don't use Dapper here we use  something else you know like okay uh  what else are you you know like so  there's a lot of nuance into this that I  don't think an AI can ever really get to  you know just  but it can help you spoilers yeah you  just spoiled Terminator for everybody  sorry oh yeah exactly  30 years 50 years ago  82 or something it's always too soon  there's always somebody who hasn't seen  it right yeah exactly Terminator dies  we'll talk about Star Wars you don't  want to know who Luke's dad is man it's  like mind-blowing like we haven't seen  it go watch it I can until lucasfilm  changes it you know like you know  they're like yeah we didn't like that  whole Darth Vader plot oh that's funny  okay well let's get right down here  we've talked to enough genes everybody  go play with it  um go play with it learn something today  yeah so it's over at chat.openapi.com go  go give it some stuff go put them in  Discord I want to see what people do I'm  interested if you come up with something  interesting yeah you know funny  interesting information implementation  for it or something fun from It Go Go  post it in Discord if you're not on our  Discord you can go join it's in the  description down below  um maybe I'll start a uh chat GPT  Channel over there yeah so um and then  uh beginner program grammar follow us  and we'd like to know kind of what  you're doing with it because it sounds  like you've been messing with it quite a  bit so like like to want to want you to  know we're calling you out  in a good way we'd like to in a good way  yeah yeah we want to know what you're  doing in a good way yeah I want to know  what you're doing with it so we can  always learn too yep definitely all  right see you guys later keep coding  [Music]
