 hello everyone and welcome back to the  future in review podcast I'm Barrett  Anderson the CEO of future interview for  those of you who have never heard a  future interview before we run the  annual Fire Conference which The  Economist has called the best technology  conference in the world and we have just  this last week announced to our audience  that we are going to be back in person  uh for fire 2023 November 6th through  9th in Los Angeles California at the  Terranea Resort it is gorgeous and we're  going to have some of the smartest  people we know there so we hope you will  join us  um the other arm of our business is  strategic news service which provides  our subscribers with the most accurate  source of information about the future  of technology and the global economy and  I am here today with Mark Anderson who  is not only the founder of strategic  news service but uh a regular  contributor the the primary regular  contributor  um and we're going to be talking about  his most recent Global report uh which  is focused on entering the era of hyper  change so Mark can you tell us a little  bit more about what what do you mean by  that what is hyper change  you know Barrett I think there's a an  increasing sentiment worldwide among  some thought leaders  that we might be better off without that  day internet  uh or iPhones or make a list you know  but the the pace of change that has been  introduced by these enabling  Technologies has exceeded uh the ability  of society let's say  subgroups of society to effectively  engage in it yeah and of course those  who are evil doers who wants a pretty  funny word  um take advantage of this in  misinformation campaigns divisive uh  postings on Twitter and all that kind of  stuff so  um it's not hard to make the case at  least for some subclass of either  people or people with a certain maturity  in terms of information uh that um this  is damaging and it's out of their not  just their control but their ability to  deal you know to cope so  um you know those those people who are a  little bit more elitist probably be like  not me but them  although I increasingly I suspect  yeah  it turns out no none of us have really  evolved don't get a pass I love  communication and connectivity that we  are experiencing today yeah and there  are a lot of interesting sub questions  that can come out of that  um how often should you rev a product  every two weeks that's too fast every  two years that's too slow but but this  is something that product managers in  Tech have wrestled with for years now  once they had the ability to rev every  five minutes that's the right answer  because people don't want to rev every  fight yeah our forced updates for  Microsoft are not much appreciated  for if at all so um a lot of problems  that are uh on both sides of the tech  fence whether you're the buyer or the  vendor whether you're the citizen or the  propagandist whatever you are  this is a really different age and this  age of hyper change isn't necessarily  100 beneficial well so and you talked  you were  you report about  guy specifically and can I'm wondering  if you can  um  explain why it is that you focused on  you know open Ai gbt and chat GPT as an  example of this hyper change well we're  seeing this  in real life right now and from the tech  perspective but it's affecting everybody  it'll affect artists in San Diego and  it's going to affect everybody so it is  affecting artists and things it is  already so so imagine  that it's November of last year that's  only weeks ago  for Christmas  and um  well the new thing is put out you know  this chat GPT so PPT is a term that  people don't need to understand uh it  stands for generative  pre-trained Transformers it's a  technology that came out of Google of  all places uh it went through a company  called open AI that was started by Elon  as a non-profit  um it's not a non-profit now and it's  funny how that works yeah that was  really weird actually and he quit he  quited that's its own that that should  be a separate issue of SNS we said that  yeah that would be very interesting  coming up maybe that'd be part two and  and then uh uh it turns out that it's  good at two things what really matters  to most people would be it Crea it's  good at content creation right but  Define good carefully because it's not  really  it's very Adept at at content creation  meaning it's a good copier it reminds me  of China they're good copiers you know  so this technology is made for one thing  only  reach more broadly  into the context of a sentence or the  context of a work of art of an image and  understand it not I shouldn't use that  word  broaden your horizons as a technology a  little a little more a little further  down that sentence a little larger into  the paragraph than before  and by doing that create a greater sense  of context not understanding but context  when you try to write a sentence as a  human being  or create an image as a human being  that's it it's a copycat right better  copycat than before  that's all that's it  so  however even though that's oh and and of  course therefore it is uh heir to all  the foibles fails and screw-ups that we  all have on the net  so if as an example Fox News gets  aggressive and runs a 24x7 story saying  something untrue heaven forbid they  would do that they're now being charged  in court for it then um  this would become part of the context  that the chatbot would pick up  and we report back then we report back  as though it were true without having  any ability itself because that's just  not part of the deal not part of the  tech to to tell the difference between  true and false  what's fascinating in terms of the hyper  change part of this to me and I think to  a lot of people is that we had just had  a nuclear winter in terms of investment  in AI  went on for about a year and it was  destroyed by all the usual things  Putin's missed adventures in in Ukraine  uh Rising inflation rates caused by the  Banks but now being cured by the Banks  and then you know all that stuff around  it so everyone kind of terrified uh the  FED wants to destroy the markets just  like Alan Greenspan did in order to do  their job which is not their job and we  all suffer because they have to create a  recession  Etc and so we're going through all that  with no investment happening really the  VCS are paring down their ownership  cutting off companies at the knees and  then refunding reinvesting in companies  which are their core success stories it  was a mess  it was a drought right suddenly I mean  what  what are you here to tell us that's no  longer the case that is no longer the  case  suddenly there's funding for AI Suddenly  at GPT  yes  this not miraculous but very interesting  new technology which is quite good at  seeming to be human  um  appears and the spirits are open and  billions and billions maybe tens of  billions maybe hundreds of billions of  dollars are going to be poured into this  and have imported over the course of  weeks right we thought that those on  this side of the line of AI called GPT  are getting funding beyond their wildest  dreams and those over here are still you  know sucking wind and and the problem  there are two problems that are obvious  one is it's a it's a typical VC Sheep  story in hyper change time  so it never it never ceases to amaze me  how much of the innovation in the world  is driven by a group of people who have  very little vision of their own and act  like lemons essentially to create  yeah products that people may or may not  need well that's why they fight over  who's going to be the lead on this  investment because they don't want to  all do the due diligence just one more  person one smart kid or once I don't  know who somebody are you in I'm in are  you in I'm in I'm in are you in I'm in  that's how it works  so they're all in right now and as an  example of the huge increase not only in  funding but in valuations suddenly in  weeks we have this company which was a  not-for-profit  founded by Elon for one reason to help  Humanity I think and then now it's a  for-profit now he's fed up with it now  he quits it now Microsoft put in one  billion another billion they did they  sell it on the record quite yet and now  they're going to put in 10 more billion  that's not quite on the reference yet we  all know what's happening that would  make 12 billion  in essentially uh well the first one was  in 27 2019 the last one was just a few  weeks ago so I don't know 11 billion in  the last few weeks  with the resulting change in valuation  from whatever it was because you can't  find it on pitchbook that's kind of  weird to 29.2 billion  wow  we're at technology I'll say it again  which in the words of Gary Marcus  probably the smartest guy around on AI  is [ __ ]  absolute [ __ ]  so exciting exciting times and yet  kind of not great  you know and and uh back to the artists  in San Diego I mean there are a lot of  people who are in the Arts or who are  writers and so forth who do a real job  of trying to edit or report or find  truth and report it  or say it or paint it or whatever it is  probably be out of a job pretty soon  because chat  GPT will replace them right it'll be  free  it's weird  so here we are here we go with something  that was almost the anti-thesis of what  Elon had in mind if I understood it  properly where he wanted to create a  powerful thing not a wrong thing  and then give it to the right people  early so they would Prevail and and have  guard rails and instead he's out of the  picture we've got a corporation that's  going to own the whole thing kind of and  I like Microsoft that you know that's a  different destiny  so  this  you talked about Microsoft putting  investing  uh what role does Google have to play in  all this oh that's the best part  it's Google's Tech  Microsoft and Google no secret  are abject enemies  pretty much  and here we go Google's Tech when it was  a non-profit was put into open AI  pretty interesting which part becomes a  four well GPT  the whole the whole deal and then now I  think it's going to be controlled by  Microsoft I've people argue with me but  that's what I think so it's basically a  takeover move by Microsoft to gain  control of Google's yeah AI it's like  thank you Google  interesting that's pretty that's pretty  interesting now Google already has GPT  so it's not like they don't have it yeah  I don't think they meant to really give  it away improve it and then give it to  Microsoft  privately yeah  yeah but that happened so here we are  and this question that we're not does  this mean that like the serious business  world that uses Outlook and for security  reasons it doesn't isn't going to have  to write their emails anymore  because that I would actually support  that would actually be a useful  application of this technology  are you being skeptical or cynical no  I'm being serious actually all right  uh well let's see I mean what  um what uh Sacha has said Nadel has said  about this uh when he made his  announcement of his most recent  investment was  well while he was firing ten thousand  people actually he was  um well he doesn't need them anymore now  that he he's investing in chat gbt  it's a small part of their Workforce  it's it's surrounding error for him it's  not a big piece yeah but um he said you  know we're out now we're uh the AI  company  and and further comments kind of like AI  will be part of every product it  reminded me when multimedia first came  out and and president Mike Maples then  of Microsoft said multimedia isn't a  division it's a part of every product so  that's that's where they're going and  who isn't right but now we're back to  this hyperscale question again you know  I mean really how fast and who will be  in charge and who will decide what and  is it true or is it false how do you  even protect your customers if you don't  know yourself if it's true or false  and you know maybe here he's right maybe  it's all [ __ ] but it's very very  fast [ __ ] and since it's powerful  and fast I guess the question I was  trying to raise is  is hyper change always good for us or is  it even essentially good for us  well so  good for us it's happening right yeah  and so so the question is like is there  what is the all what is what's the  alternative what do we do instead  how do we as a society get smarter about  and build protections into  save us from our own stupidity  well let's go back to Rupert Murdoch for  a minute  my least favorite person I think at  least in the news world so here's a guy  who didn't care at all about what was  true he made it billions and billions of  dollars off of fox and off of newspapers  printing things which are probably not  true and and whole empire and the media  based on turning  um what was the news idea into a theater  or or a shouting or an anger idea  um and it worked for money but it  destroyed essentially destroyed the  world of Journalism starting to tell  before we even saw the Advent of this of  the deleterious effects that came from  social media stealing all the ad money  like Googles  paying all the media companies to put  their content exclusively on Facebook  and cutting them off from all of our  subscribers yeah  all that so you know from one  perspective or another  we've lost even a value I'm going to say  something political which I never do the  Republicans  darn them  have particularly under Trump  who once was President which is pretty  amazing uh have have um  somehow  D  monetized or legitimized the idea of  Truth  and of science now I never thought that  I'd see that happen in my lifetime but  they have  they did it intentionally  for for reasons of power and so it kind  of began with Fox and spread out  throughout the entire or half the Geo  period or something maybe all of it so  here we are in this now this age where  does true and false matter to them no  yeah I want to hear Q Anon right that's  all so it's it's so badly off the tracks  those of us who remain actually  interested in science and experiments  that can be repeated twice in a row you  know you drop the ball from the Tower of  Pisa and it follows the same speed twice  it's an incredible thing  um that's the world we live in uh so how  does this play out  is it true that truth doesn't matter  anymore if people say it enough  I don't know but the VC dollars would  say yes  right now this month they would say yes  it's unimportant it's relevant  to us to them  uh try as they might to make excuses  about why it's okay to put tens or  hundreds of billions of dollars into  this technology which clearly creates  falsehood  so the answer would your question would  be  what's the opposite of that well the  opposite of that would be telling the  truth  knowingly how do you do that well there  are ideas afoot  um I'll just say it because my  disclosure bias I'm running a company  called pattern computer where we happen  to do explainable AI it's the Holy Grail  of all AI by the way it's not like just  us saying this and  if you had it you'd use it those guys  don't have it so they're not using it  but it's important and what it means is  it's explainable it's transparent  there's no black box problem you can see  through everything that's happening you  know how it did what it did and  therefore you can see what's true and  what's false  that's the technical answer but even  that even that would require so much  time  you know the average person is not going  to do that  no no it shouldn't be the problem for  the average person and so and so  therefore you you have the same  you can you can use you know explainable  AI to make business decisions and to  improve your business decisions but for  the average person you're gonna have the  same issue it doesn't fix this  information issue it's going to be a  matter of the corporations and the  governments not the individuals but  imagine you had as an example a choice  of which car to buy  and here I'm gonna pick up my friend  Elon but he doesn't deserve it he's far  ahead from everybody else with  autonomous driving I've been told by  people who are experts in that world you  cannot have safe autonomous driving or  Flying Without explainability in other  words you have to know why the car  crashed or didn't crash  um so if you had a choice I mean car a  is a new Ford you know Mustang Maki or  whatever and it's got it  God explainability and the other one  does or something else doesn't have it  and you're going to put your family into  one of those two cars there you are at  the Hilton front door and you put him  into a car to go to Chicago O'Hare  Airport which car did you pick  the one with explainability and you know  that because they advertise that they  use it  so it's going to be corporations or even  governments that say you're going to  have to have this like the gdpr requires  this in Europe  if if if you're being dealt with by AI  you have the right to know why I did  what it did to you  you have a legal right  so okay fine and you know governments  and and corporations I think will have  to be the leaders in this  we shall see you shall see this is this  is It's a daunting it's a daunting  thought really to think about what does  that look like moving forward  um it's daunting partly because it's  catching on so fast to be a liar  if lying is going to be the deal or  Italian truths are going to be part of  the deal how fast can we stand up to  telling the truth part  well  strategic news service will always tell  you the truth and will never be written  by a chat GPT  has a hard time extrapolating across  multiple ecosystems and actors and  identifying  that level of analysis still yeah that  may not always be true but  that'll be trivial compared to knowing  what's true and false yeah  well so that's the problem and I hope  for all of our sakes that we find some  way of coping with an era of hyper  change where Society has served better  than we're serving society today  and if you'd like to join in that plate  with a community of like-minded uh  readers and and thinkers you can join  strategic news service at the link
