 what are we gonna be 25 years from now  what are we going to be  25 years probably something like that  could be a whole brain interface  like almost all the neurons are  connected to these sort of AI extension  of yourself  the fear is that eventually you're gonna  have to cut the whole top of someone's  head off and put a new top if you want  to go with full AI symbiosis you'll  probably want to do something like that  it will enable anyone who wants to have  superhuman cognition  you already have a computer extension of  yourself and your phone the Essential  Elements of an AI neural net are really  very similar to a human brain you're  neural net the way your brain works  right now you've got Olympic system  basically and you've got the cortex  cortex is much much smarter than the  Olympic system nonetheless they work  together well the computer the AI is  like a third layer a tertiary layer like  that could be symbiotic with the cortex  it would be much smarter than the cortex  and you actually have that right now  your phone is capable of things and your  computer is capable things that your  brain is definitely not storing  terabytes of information doing  incredible calculations it's just like I  said the data rate is slow the  connection is weak if we do have a third  layer that is also symbiotic that could  be quite a positive outcome for the  future  if Humanity collectivity decides that  creating digital superintelligence is  The Right Move we should do so very very  carefully the danger of AI is much  greater than the the danger of nuclear  warheads so why do we have no regulatory  oversight  this is insane I try to convince people  to slow down slow down AI to regulate AI  this was futile so-called AI experts is  that they they think they know more than  they do they Define themselves by their  intelligence and they they don't like  the idea that a machine could be way  smarter than them I'm really quite close  to The Cutting Edge in Ai and it scares  the hell out of me usually it'll be  something some new technology will cause  damage or death there will be an outcry  there will be investigation eventually  regulations this all takes many years  if you can't beat it join it that's like  the purpose of neurolink is to create a  high bandwidth interface to the brain  such that we can be symbiotic with AI  well most people arise they are already  a cyborg it's just that the  communication rate between you and the  cybernetic extension of yourself that is  your phone and computer is slow that is  like a tiny stroll of information flow  between your biological self and your  digital self and we need to make that  tiny straw like a giant River but the  idea of saving yourself and then  transforming that into some sort of a  biological State solve the data rate  problem and then people may decide that  they want to retain their biological  self or not I think they'll probably  choose retainable at biological self  you literally could fundamentally change  the way human beings interface with each  other you will be essentially  snapshotted into a computer at any time  if your biological self dies you're just  upload into a new unit now you wouldn't  be exactly the same person but you're  also not exactly the same person when  you wake up every morning if you got  disintegrated but then got reintegrated  immediately with no pain or anything did  you die what is death what is what does  death actually mean it's the loss of the  information associated with that  individual like you know or in a video  game you do that you die a lot in video  games but you then you just come back to  a safe game state if you no longer have  lots of information associated with that  individual death has no meaning  I mean the possibilities are endless if  you've got like a version 10 eurolink  whatever bar in the future  you could remember you could recall  everything the entire sensory experience  emotions everything everything  everything  if you could change what you think was  so fast yeah this whole thing right now  could be a replayed memory it could be  yeah it may be
