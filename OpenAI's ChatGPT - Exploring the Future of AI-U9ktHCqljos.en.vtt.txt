 [Music]  hi there I'm deep Dillon welcome to your  AI injection the podcast where we  discuss state-of-the-art techniques and  artificial intelligence with a focus on  how these capabilities are used to  transform organizations making them more  efficient impactful and successful  [Music]  with all this auto-generated generic  knowledge that we're throwing out there  and that we're amplifying with these AI  tools yeah how do we find the the  individualized content that is actually  important that matters I would ask a  different question does it matter if the  non-individualized content passes the  test where I don't know X number of  people love it I think it's amazing then  doesn't matter it does because it's not  about whether you love it or whether it  appeals to the masses it matters well  it's Unique is it new is it something  worth you spending your time on I think  that me personally if I read something  and I don't know the author I feel like  the goal of an educational system should  be able to get us to the point where we  can reason about it and process it  regardless of source and absolutely  absolutely but let's say in this case if  the source is the AI mind if you well  and it's good and I can reason about it  because I feel pretty confident that I  can read something like you could you  could take Tucker Carlson's name off of  something and put it in my feed and I'm  pretty sure I'm gonna be like that's  dribble and crap and I'm out of here and  similarly you know you could take  somebody some brilliant person Plato  Einstein whoever and I'm gonna be like  okay this is you know I can track the  the thinking and the layout I'm okay  being confused about whether it's an AI  or a human if the reasoning and  everything is there the part that I find  more concerning and I think it will get  solved is the utter like lack of trying  to like connect the things it says back  to citations like there's no citations  there's no referencing I wonder if that  is even possible I mean you know we can  definitely do it after the fact like we  can take these things  yeah it's like somebody that said  something simple something like that  yeah yeah and somebody will do that and  I think that's actually a good idea for  somebody to make the ultimate reference  generator uh because I think that  stuff's gonna be become more important  so we can track these back and in that  context it makes sense what you're  saying because in that context we want  to track it back to a human but what's  the difference between the AI saying  something the AI saying something and a  human standing behind what it said like  stamping it and uh and a human using the  AI as a tool to say something that they  don't acknowledge the AI for no I mean  it's totally fine and even if it would  go and it would assemble articles out of  let's say 30 40 different articles and  put them together in a meaningful way  and it's all good meaningful information  I wouldn't I wouldn't say anything  against it right the question is how  much of it is just repetition and  replication of something that is old or  something is already out there and how  much will it kind of like further modern  the field of finding like new worthwhile  things that I should spend my time with  reading I don't I don't know like the  thing that's been most impressive to me  as I've been playing with chat gbt it  really excels at high level thinking and  that's like some of the hardest thing  thinking to do like distilling thing  like the the top three things to uh and  and I've been testing it in like really  specific domains of our clients like I  was down in plastic surgery land and I  was over in uh deep in about machine  learning and AI is that really true high  level thinking is is one of the most  difficult thinking to do or is it just  like maybe for me for me of abstraction  that everybody that doesn't actually  know what they're talking about is  blabbering about because very often in  higher level thinking people are talking  about generalized Concepts that are so  vague that when it comes down to it they  would have no clue what to do and  actually how to realize something like  that you know your typical business  strategic talk that is somewhere up 10  000 feet of the clouds and they're all  repeating repeating what the other  people are saying without saying  anything  that's bad strategy that's not what I'm  talking about I'm talking about higher  level summarizations Geeks like you you  and me would listen to and say yeah that  that that makes sense I'm talking about  passing it through your own personal  filter what did I ask it yesterday I  took a you know a problem that you know  that we're facing I said something like  how can I use a large language model to  generate high quality summaries of large  conversations and how can I uh assess  efficacy on those generated summaries  and at first time it kind of just I  don't usually like it when it just spits  out a paragraph of stuff so then I say  retry but give me an explicit list with  details and the use of examples and I  looked at that I'm like that's a high  level proposal it's not exactly what I  would write but it's pretty much a high  level proposal and I looked at it I'm  like nothing in there is wrong and this  isn't subject matter that I don't know I  mean I know I know if it's saying  something stupid yeah yeah yeah I'm  looking at it going huh okay and then if  there's something that I'm like I need a  little more detail on then I grab like  you know it'll list like seven seven  steps to do whatever I'll grab number  three and I'm like and I'll rephrase  that as a question and I'll again I  always seem to have to ask it to add  examples in detail and then it tears it  apart a little bit I mean it's just  something I don't know man we're in a  different place than we were a week ago  we're in a different place I mean  there's a reason everyone in Tech is  obsessed with this thing because last  Wednesday my feed starts getting all  this stuff in it I'm like whatever  Thursday my feed starts having you know  people making like really bold claims  that I'm like who is this idiot like why  are they saying that Google's irrelevant  blah blah blah blah and I and then by  Friday by Friday it's like people whose  opinions matter uh to me and the world  saying the same crazy things and then  I'm like I gotta play with this thing so  then I start playing with it I figured  10 minutes I'll be out of here I'll be  able to fit it in with my you know like  what I've made up on large language  models in my head before but I feel like  there's like a Tipping Point you know  like if you think pre-web when we we had  the internet we had darpanet we had  email we had all you know our teams  Mosaic that's the search engine before  Mosaic before Mosaic like I'm talking  1992 we had all of the the raw  ingredients and then in each ml browser  Mosaic comes along and just kind of  stitches it together a little bit well  it's all about it it's all about  Discovery it's all about finding things  that are relevant to you at that moment  in time and that's how the whole search  was born right well that the little ux  tweak which I would argue like that's  kind of what the the browser was the ux  tweak  yeah I guess it definitely was a ux HTML  was a ux it was a way of um it was a  publishing system really yeah but it  exposed the graph in a way that was  navigable for the first time right but  before that we had BBS systems so that's  kind of like the precursor to it right  where everybody had like their own  little  um content management system that they  would give you access to and you could  play with it and read it yeah yeah  exactly so I would I would argue it was  like it was something that  intellectually you would think of as  fairly small but it was like a Tipping  Point like as soon as everybody saw that  I mean I remember sitting around in a  computer lab in in grad school and there  was like five of us overlooking  somebody's shoulder and they're like  yeah this came out yesterday and there  were there was literally 80 websites on  the internet at that um at that moment  and we're looking at it going like oh my  God the next 30 years of my life just  flashed before me I'm like I gotta  change everything this is what I'm  working on  right I feel like that something just  flipped and you know we've been working  in machine learning and AI forever  let's come back to what does it lead to  I mean great we have this thing that's  good at like combining summarizing  existing information I I still would say  there's no reasoning behind it it does  not come up with like novel and New  Concepts it just doesn't right  um  what does it lead to I mean on the one  hand yeah content explosion right now  everybody that knows how to use this  will use it as an assisted authoring  tool and we'll just get a lot more  content I think I think the problem with  the internet today is there's already  too much content and the real challenge  is you have only seen so many hours in  the day what should you read and you had  a perfect example earlier because you  said well you know last week I saw my  feeds explode and at first I didn't pay  attention to it and then you know  there's more and more on the same topic  and uh then you're like well now I have  to look what this is right and and of  course yeah if something goes viral  that's how we discover content that many  other people you know are discovering  but how much of it gets lost right even  if I browse to my Apple news in the  morning it's kind of like I could do  this for three hours because every day  there's so much freaking content what I  would like to know is what should I be  reading and at that point it becomes  literally dangerous right because now  not only there's no objective way to do  that you're at the at the mercy of the  recommendation engines which will  technically buyers you yes but that's  where I think the conversational piece  is kind of interesting so like yesterday  I just did an experiment once I started  getting and infatuated with this thing  I'm like okay every single question I  have in my head I'm going to go to this  thing so the first it's early morning  I'm like in the office it's kind of dark  I'm trying to get moving so I just ask  it like hey you know what music should I  listen to right now and I gave it a  little bit more info like I gave it  something  it's dark I mean a somber mood I just  need to get a little bit of motivation  and I gave it like I didn't even give it  specific band names I just gave it a  couple of genres I kid you not it came  back with a totally OBS to me at least  obscure French male electoral pop singer  and I never told this thing that I've  been obsessed with like weird French  Lounge music for the last you know year  I don't think it even knows I don't know  how the hell it figured that out it  gives me this guy and I'm thinking what  a random thing I figured it'd be like  the Neil Diamond of of France I put it  in I'm like oh my God this is so good  and it was the perfect thing to be  listening to right then  I don't know I'm just gonna run some  experiments for the next couple weeks  well I'm asking this thing everything  like for the longest time I I'm a strong  believer that the gene pool is limited  right you see that you see people that  look like other people you know we're  not all this individual as we think we  are right and so if you really can take  the experiences of 8 billion people  you'll find a lot that I like you  probably right and this music example is  something like that like kind of like in  this particular scenario and situation  what should you be listening to I know  but I'm so used to you know the 30 years  of machine learning that we've been  doing I have a mental model of like oh I  have to give it a bunch of history and  give it a bunch of examples I'm not used  to having you know a three prompt a  three chat response turnaround and  getting something like that  have data have a hypothesis on some high  value insights that have extracted  automatically could transform your  business not sure how to proceed bounce  your ideas off one of our data  scientists with a free console reach out  at zionics.com you'll talk to an expert  not a salesperson  [Music]  yesterday so you know I mean it's kind  of like it's kind of like a mixture of  One-Shot learning and feature importance  right yeah it's literally like you're  one shot is like your most important  feature so what else is out there that  has this one thing as its most important  feature this feels like brain  augmentation on someone like yesterday  I'm in a conference a meeting with a  client and I I'm about to like say  something and then I'm like oh wait I'm  on chat GPT experiment time so I'm going  to ask Chad David G first I ask it  during the meeting yeah during the  meeting I ask it something it gives me  something like oh my God I didn't think  of that and then I like assimilated into  what I said  and like that is that is nothing that  I've ever done it's like your personal  little pocket advisor now it's your  personal genius friend yeah like it's  it's crazy like what does that mean when  we all have a little personal genius  friend and I I get I really get the  dangers of it saying something stupid  which is why I'm you know but but it's  not so different different from Google  or a search engine in that way right  because you how often would you do that  you sit in a meeting and somebody talks  about something you don't know you  Google it real quick and you say you  know but now it's hard to to digest the  content because you get like 10 search  results maybe at first glance you can  kind of figure out what it is about but  you don't have time to read the articles  yeah so this thing goes one step further  five-minute experience and put it into a  15 second experience yeah and this thing  like I said this thing goes one step  further and um it read the articles for  you and it gives you like you know the  cliff notes pretty much the part that  really blows me away is just the  trajectory of this stuff right like like  all we do is machine learning we're  constantly doing machine learning and I  just feel like every day there's some  new like massive model that's crazy I  wasn't even thinking about changing  video a week ago I was still digesting  you know like Dolly and some of the  other stuff right that that's come out  and and now  like but you but you also these are  already saying gpt4 is around the corner  and it's and like the word on the street  is it's multimodal it's it's going to be  a one and a half trillion parameter  model it's going to be text it to audio  to video the last thing I've seen is  like video generation right they're  working on video generation but the open  AI guys like the next model I don't know  if this is true we'll find out when it  comes out but that it's it's multimodal  and uh and it's gonna do videos so it's  gonna be like hey surreal is seen of you  know giraffe walking down the street in  you know in 18th century you know Paris  or something and it and give me 15  seconds worth and boom there you go but  but  I guess we have to ask ourselves it's  all nice and it's definitely like worth  the marketing or The Sensational hype so  was Dali it's kind of fascinating it's  fun to play with  what you really have to ask yourself  though is like what problems does it  solve  I think we're just at the very beginning  of unpacking that  but I think certainly with respect to  anyone who is authoring content it does  not make sense to me to not at least  learn from this thing like to leverage  it that's if you think about it if you  are authoring content  for the sake of authoring content I  agree if you're authoring content  because you really think you have  something to say you should write it  yourself yes I'm not saying you're not  writing itself when you're Consulting  this thing like like think of it as your  Genius buddy and you're working on your  research project and you're just like  asking you know like you're just telling  them what you're up to I think of it  more like that I don't think of it as  like oh I'm just gonna like hit this  thing it spits out a bunch of stuff I'm  gonna publish it like research is a good  example right it's good this this thing  can like write articles about existing  things it could never publish a new  research paper I mean people publish  survey articles all the time right right  but then we're back to the regurgitating  things that are already out there yeah  no I mean you're right about that like  there's a few things that it excels at  and there's a few things that it clearly  doesn't excel at I mean one of the  things that it excels at is this like  it's like the best list generator I've  ever seen in my life like it makes the  best lists of anything I've seen  um the the other thing is it makes and  that includes like lists of questions to  ask and as soon as you start realizing  that you can use it to help you figure  out the questions to ask that's like  next level uh interaction you know and  then you can ask it the question once  you've got the listings and you can  start twerking them I feel like I'm not  going to really be in an ideation  session again without consulting it I  feel like I'm never going to send a  proposal out again without consulting it  it sounds like it's going to be a great  writing tool yeah  it's going to be if it's done right  you hope so you would hope so  um if it's really as good as you say it  might actually find its place like you  said it might find its place next to  Google yeah and I I would say Google I  don't know everyone there should be  figuring out how do we integrate this  into Google if they aren't already I'm  sure they have been for a few years  Google in a way has something like that  integrated in its prompt like depending  on what you Google for if it's really a  question or something you know the first  thing that pops up in Google which is  very often just the answer to your  question and then the search results  come yeah so they do have that in the  less like you know we'll write an  article about it but we try to figure  out what you mean and what you are  looking what you want to solve but they  don't really have anything that like  Google's have uh ultimately is like a  reference lookup they're like directing  you to places and the calculator and  they they do stuff like um you know  events are covered like the FIFA World  Cup if you're asking what are the scores  yes there's definitely like all the one  box thing you can you can ask stupid  questions like converting Celsius to  Fahrenheit and stuff right get the the  answer right away so yeah I mean I think  they're going to continue to release  features that are based on this power  capability I mean I don't think Google's  going away I mean I think Google has  every capability of of matching what we  see here and and even I see this is I  see this is complementary it's it's this  is a trajectory yeah that that Global AI  Community is on and you know this kind  of multimodal reasoning is going to  continue to go uh it's it's not even  reasoning it's just content Generation  Well I think content generation is a  demeaning term for what it's actually  doing here the content generation  implies that you're just writing [ __ ]  for the sake of writing [ __ ] if you're  authoring something so that's what Dolly  does right it's generated [ __ ] for the  sake of generating [ __ ] for example okay  well I don't know I haven't spent as  much time with Dolly as I have with this  it generates images based on your prompt  yeah but that's like that's also saying  that you know if you're an artist you  know in a Picasso that all you did was  generate [ __ ] for the sake of generation  I don't think that's true I think what  Picasso brought the world was a  different way of perceiving reality  right  fundamentally differently I think that's  that's exactly that's a good example I  think that is exactly what is lost in  something like chat GPT in Picasso he  had a vision so or he would like project  in a way how he sees the world or how he  imagines something he has an intention  behind this image right that comes from  him and he's trying to express it in a  painting in chat CPT it's a little  differently it's kind of like you have  an idea too but you're not expressing  yourself you're trying to like it's more  like how other people would have  presented the idea so the idea is there  but not your projection of the idea if  that makes any sense right your problem  that's your idea well that's where you  really gotta spend some time playing  with Chad that's where you're  interacting with it you are the  puppeteer of this very powerful puppet  you're steering it you know like I'm  having it author or college essay you  know for uh  it's kind of like you're just like  you're just like trying to um like  twiddle with it until you like what it  wrote I think you're trying to get it to  a starting point that you're gonna go  take and do something with in that case  you are the reviewer you're not the  author right you like I said you're like  the editor of the newspaper that gives  you so every editor is underlying an  idea yeah and then reads the article  like that section I think I think you  you play the role of editor until you  cut and paste what's in there and tweak  it and now you start writing on top of  it and now you're the author yeah so  anyway I mean definitely super useful I  mean I don't know I'm just fascinated  because if you look at it I'm a bit  scared about the spam we're gonna see  okay that's inevitable  man but it's already all over the  internet as of Wednesday but it's  probably going to distinguish the spam  from the real stuff now  well I think provenance is still  important like you know so and so works  for such and such company and is a real  human as opposed to so and so is an AI  bot created by so-and-so who's out doing  whatever well and provenance is going to  be key and being able to like prove  provenance so in the same the same way  that we get Google articles right it's  kind of like basically peer reviewed  like people that link to content I I  guess I guess the ranking of content  doesn't really change just the sum I  mean I think there's a there's going to  be startups that emerge in companies  that try to help us navigate the even  just the provenance isn't an easy  problem with this stuff you know it's  like I mean I I can see like the legal  world is going to get taxed with  questions somebody's going to go into  you know something like Chad gbt they're  gonna have it author lyrics for a song  They're Gonna Go sing their song they  might have the audio version and render  the chords and everything somebody else  is going to be like you ripped up so and  so and so and so and so and so we need  patent GPT yeah  that's what I'm saying like reference  checking capability is going to be super  powerful like someone needs to make  automatic reference checking so that you  can like be an honest you know user of  this thing whereas right now I don't  think you can feel safe in just cutting  and pasting it to you know to your  college essay or whatever or your your  exam or whatever you have to manipulate  and change it a ton and even then it's  it's sort of like did you plagiarize  like you don't even know even the  machine doesn't know you don't know you  don't know whether or not you copied  like somebody's stuff verbatim or if  it's assembled or if it's like somehow  put together or rephrased or paraphrased  or who knows I think we're in a new  world  that's all for this episode I'm deep  Dylan your host saying check back soon  for your next AI
