 today we're going to talk with chat GPT  about one of the things that I think a  lot of people are kind of overlooking  which is the fact that everyone has  access to this and the barrier of Entry  is quite low one of the things that you  might notice is that Tech is rapidly  evolving I see a lot of people that are  using chat GPT and all these amazing  ways and I'm just still stuck on telling  it to write me a poem about this in a  world of unlimited noise where  competition is fierce and bold it can be  really hard to find your voice and stand  out from the crowd but fear not dear  friend for you have within the strength  and skills to rise above with dedication  hard work and a willingness to begin you  can differentiate yourself with love  Chad gbt can do virtually anything that  you want it to do but it won't always do  it accurately hence you need to still  have some level of knowledge one of the  skills that I think you can work on  right now and that I'm trying to develop  is that ability to to learn fast and be  very adaptable I can say elaborate  further so I simply just reminded it  that I'd like it in the Twitter thread  format above and if I come in here to  Twitter here we'll see that it is  keeping it pretty close but it didn't  quite do the character limit I see that  it's limited to 280 characters so I'm  just going to ask it to make sure that  each point is less than 280 characters  if I copy and paste them into Twitter I  see that successfully followed my  directions it's not bad it's not like a  super amazing Twitter thread so I'm  simply going to tell chat GPT that I  think it's a bit dull I'm gonna remind  it again to make it less than 280  characters and I'm also going to see if  it can add some sort of story that makes  it real world applicable and engaging to  the viewer here we see there is an  example at the bottom it's leaving the  same five threads but it's giving us  this and just like that we have our  thread posted did not take too long at  all I'm gonna see what chat GPT  recommends we do I want it to be cheap  to start require little overhead and I  want to be able to do it myself so  they're recommending that we go with a  chat bot service for small businesses  and to start the business we need to  develop or acquire a chatbot software  and then offer it as a service focusing  on a specific industry or type of  business customizing it to fit their  specific needs we can leverage something  like chat GPT  specifically fine-tuning or training it  which we can't do today but in the  future this will be possible let's see  what niche's chat GPT thinks offers the  most upside so it's recommending that I  provide my interest skills and goals now  it says technology Healthcare renewable  energy it's looking like it might have  broken away from our chatbot idea I  don't think the conversation's a hundred  percent there yet I think if you go down  a fantasy narrative and go back and  forth it works really cool maybe we can  do that in a future video I also think  and one of my top use cases that I  thought of when this first came out is  you can plan content very quickly now  the idea that it's recommending now is  to automatically generate high quality  written content such as blogs articles  social media posts there's going to be  just so much competition in that Niche  you're not going to make that much money  so it says to differentiate by focusing  on a specific Niche or target audience  now it says we can offer personalized  training and support if we can kind of  remove all of the noise that goes into  running a business from content creation  to basic customer service back and forth  with emails and stuff then we're gonna  have a little bit more time to focus on  personalized training we can also have  satisfaction guarantees free trials  things along those lines the key to  differentiating ourselves is to  consistently offer value and expertise  in our chosen Niche this would be an  interesting Niche so they're saying for  businesses that need a large volume of  content lack the time of resources so  we're going to be the expert that can  execute now you're probably thinking how  do I become an expert on this they're  saying that we need to gain a deep  understanding of AI technology and  content creation hands-on experience is  always going to be the best now I just  had to take my car into the shop this  week I wonder if chat GPT thinks  mechanics would be a good Niche they're  not going to give me a yes or no here  and here it will say one potential  advantage of focusing on mechanics is  that mechanics often need a large volume  of written content and they may be  interested to improve the efficiency and  accuracy of their operations on the  other hand there may be significant  competition I think your biggest hurdle  here is going to be people embracing  change so a lot of people are stuck in  their own routines they're not going to  embrace change however if you were to  get them as a client that's a good thing  for you and they're not going to be the  most technical people in the world which  means they're not going to be generating  this content themselves how you get them  as a client that's the hurdle so I'm  going to wrap it up by asking chat GPT  what timeline is appropriate and also  seeing if it'll give us a business plan  within the scope of the timeline and we  got our first error message I get that  occasionally if I just save and submit  it again it will generate an answer now  let's look at this Business outline as  it finishes up and I like that it starts  by saying that it's difficult to  determine a specific timeline however as  a general timeline month one to two  research and mechanics in the industry  assess the potential demand for AI  powered content identify potential  customers says strengths and weaknesses  develop a basic business plan three and  four will pursue education and training  now in this space it's going to evolve  every four months so you really have to  learn how to learn now months five and  six we're going to continue to revise  our plan and months seven and eight  we're going to launch our AI powered  content creation service this seems like  a decent guideline in today's video we  discussed the niche of AI powered  content creation services and how they  can help businesses save time and  resources while still meeting their  content needs we also talked about the  potential benefits of focusing on the  mechanics industry as a target market  for these services so yeah this is  pretty cool now it did keep what we  talked about at the end but at the  beginning remember I did say how can we  differentiate ourselves so we kind of  worked through how we can differentiate  ourselves we had a conversation and I  think building on top of chat GPT right  now we have to almost become adaptable  and learn how to learn to take the tools  and use them better and if we can do  that then we can plug into a Marketplace  Within any Niche and we can solve  problems and we can generate results now  my name is Scott with AI profits  hopefully this video brought you some  value if it did give this video a like  leave a comment down below what your  thoughts are and we'll see you in the  next one
