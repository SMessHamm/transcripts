 hello everyone in this video I will show  you how we can take advantage of chat  GPT to assist enhance our experience in  building flows in power automate it can  help us write expressions build adaptive  cards markdown syntax HTML formatting  Styles when sending emails and in a lot  more scenarios  I will also cover in product AI  capabilities which leverage GPT 3  wherein we can simply describe our flow  in simple text and AI will go ahead and  suggest a flow that we can Leverage  so let's check it out in action  [Music]  creating flows is the foundation of  power automate  and now you can describe what you want  to automate in a sentence and an AI  based co-pilot will build your flow in  seconds  just describe it and let AI do the magic  this is an in product capability  you can pick from a wide variety of  examples  if you click on view more examples it  will give you additional options to  choose from  currently it supports a standard set of  connections  let's try this out in a real world  scenario  I have an Excel file that has a table  with customer data and I would like to  import this data into a SharePoint list  I type the flow I need in words  click on form  and AI provides a suggested flow  I can review the flow suggestion click  next  review the connections that the flow  leverages  click next  I can start configuring the actions  within the flow right here  this is an optional step I recommend  directly going to create flow  and this has created the framework that  I need for my automation process  all I have to do is connect the dots  the location of my Excel file  is OneDrive for business  the library OneDrive  I'll pick my file  this will list out the tables in my  Excel file I'll pick my customer info  table  then for each of the records obtained  from my Excel file  go ahead and create the item  in my SharePoint list  customer data  title would come from the column first  name in my Excel file last name I'll map  it to last name  age  gender  and that completes my flow I'll click  save  I'll click test  and run this flow manually  the flow triggers connects to my Excel  file and starts loading all the data  in my SharePoint list  I have a Microsoft form users fill out  the form when they hit submit I would  like to send a notification if any user  signs up for future volunteering  opportunities by saying yes for the  specific question  once again I describe my flow  click confirm  I'll click create  pick my form  for the response details  I'll pick my form  my condition here is  from Dynamic content the response for  the question would you like to sign up  for future volunteering opportunities if  this is equal to yes  only then I would like to send  in this case myself an email  I'll put in a subject and on the body  I'll just plug in the responders email  and save my flow  Sarah a user in my organization fills  out the form  says yes for future volunteering  opportunities submits are response  here is the email to the admin Raza  about the individual who signed up for  future volunteering opportunities  another in-product AI feature is known  as format data by examples  here I have a flow that gets data from a  SharePoint list  creates an HTML table and sends all that  data out in an email  now the email that I have received here  has the due date in this specific format  I can simply copy an example of the data  and in my flow for due date  I will head over to expression and  leverage format data by examples  here I can pick Dynamic content  I'll pick my due date  I'll provide the example data for this  and here I can plug in what the desired  output looks like  notice as I start typing AI interprets  my intention it gives me some suggested  Transformations that I can Leverage  so I like this one March 17 2022 I'll  select this and click get expression  and this will generate a suggested  expression  now I can test this with different  values so I'll provide sample data click  text and it transforms it perfectly  I'll click apply and that plugs in my  expression  thanks to AI  once the flow runs  this time the email that I receive has  the due date in the desired format  for cloudflows we have process insights  which allow us to gain insights and  improve our flows with the help of  process mining  with a single click you can visualize  your flow's performance identify  bottlenecks  here is an example of one of my approval  flows that I enabled process insights  for  you can see how it gives me a nice  flowchart of each and every action on my  flow  it also gives me details around how many  times these actions have been called  what is the average duration of these  actions  and a lot more useful information  if my approval action is taking a lot of  time flows time out after 30 days maybe  my approvers are cutting it really close  I could go back and add reminders for  approvals  we also have chat GPD  you can consider this as your friend  with chat GPD we can have conversations  in natural language  contextual conversations  let's begin with learning about power  automate  what is power automate  it's a cloud-based service from  Microsoft that allows users to create  automated workflows  what are the types of flows  it starts listing out all the different  types of flows that are available  flows and Azure logic apps  probably one of the top questions what  are the best practices and building  flows  using naming conventions testing  validating error handling documenting  your flows and more  any question you have around power  automate you can try asking chat GPD for  that  now let's see how chat GPT can assist or  enhance our experience of creating flows  let's take a real world scenario  I have a SharePoint list where users  would make travel requests  and once the requests come in I would  like to start an approval process  here Raza makes a travel request  now the item is created  I would like to start the flow set the  status to pending and assign an approval  request  I describe my flow click confirm here is  the suggested flow  I'll go ahead and click next  click next  and create my flow  connect to my SharePoint site and list  here it will start the approval process  I'll pick the approval type as first to  respond  I'll give the title of the approval  myself as the approver  I've just gone ahead and completed the  start and wait for an approval action  here with details from my travel request  right before this I have added an update  item action to set the approval status  to pending  in the condition below I've checked to  see the outcome of the approval and  accordingly I have set the status to  approved or rejected  now let's see what happens when this  flow runs when that item was created  we can see that the flow has triggered  as the approval status here has changed  to pending  Reza as the approver gets the approval  task  if you look at details in general it  supports a language known as markdown  and markdown you would have to learn how  it works in order to format the details  that you've put out  I'll just go ahead and copy what I have  in the details section  I'll say can you add markdown for the  following that's the code that I had  it will start adding markdown syntax to  enhance the approval body experience for  me  I can simply click copy code  go back to my flow  and paste the markdown data that I got  from chat gbd Let's test this out  this time the approval email  notice the body has the information  based upon the markdown syntax that was  provided by chatgpt  the total cost  let's ask chat GPD how to do that  and chat GPT provides me the expression  there's a function called add which  allows me to add two numbers  I have changed the text here to total  cost and for the value I will head over  to expression and use that function to  add  the estimated airfare  comma estimated hotel cost  and this time when the flow runs  the approval email that I have received  has the total cost  not my approver in this scenario is hard  coded  but let's say I would like to bring my  approvers from a SharePoint group  before that  if I explore the SharePoint connector  I can leverage the send and HTTP request  to SharePoint action  now this requires me to know the rest  API endpoint that I would have to call  to get the group members  let's try see if chat gbd can help us  I've asked my question  and chat GPD starts providing all the  steps  it gives me the API endpoint that I can  simply go and copy  the API endpoint it's the endpoint that  I just copied  the group name token I will replace with  my group name  and now when this flow will run  this action will output  all the information about the users in  that SharePoint group  the body of the send and HTTP action has  this Json  and then to get the emails  I'll use the select action  from write an expression  body of the name of my action  d results  and from this  I only need  email so I'll use item of email  we can see the output of Select in  action when the flow runs  now I need to add that to assigned 2  which requires email addresses semicolon  separated in the form of a string  I'll plug in my request convert array to  a semicolon separated string  and it starts walking me through the  steps  so it says there's an expression  function called join that can join an  array of data with semicolon  so to try that out here I'll go to  expression  use the join function  to join the output of Select which is an  array with semicolon  the approval process has started  Sarah being one of the approvers gets  the approval task let's say Sarah goes  ahead and approves this click submit  and we can see how the approval is  complete  goes under the approved side of the  branch  and it updates the status to approved  which is what gets reflected in the  SharePoint list  I have the flow that sends out data from  a SharePoint list in the form of an HTML  table in an email  now this table doesn't have any style  associated with it  so I'll say generate style for an HTML  table with headers  and it will start generating HTML style  for us  I can simply go ahead and copy the code  go to my send an email action  as I'm an HTML View for the body  attribute  I'll paste that style  the flow runs  and this time the table that I receive  has the HTML style applied to it thanks  to chat gbd  get items gets data from my work  progress tracker list  and here I would like to apply a filter  query which requires an odata style  filter query to only return the data  that I need in my output email  I only need data from my SharePoint list  where the progress which is a choice  column is in progress  I'll plug in my request and chat GPT  will start formulating that odata query  here it has generated the filter  condition which is the name of my column  equals in progress  I can copy this  and plug that filter query condition  here  so this time when the flow runs  the email will only include those items  from my SharePoint list where the status  is in progress  status is in progress and the percent  complete is less than 60.  notice it understands the context but at  the same time I'm also feeding it  relevant information my column name my  column type  so accordingly it gives me the  information  I'll copy this  plug that expression here  I'll plug in the actual name of my  SharePoint column  this time when the flow runs I get only  two items because those are the items  that are in progress and percent  complete is less than 60.  adaptive cards  in power automate we have the ability to  post these rich UI like cards in  Microsoft teams  adaptive cards has a specific schema  associated with it  let's try taking help from chat gbt  I'll say create an Adaptive card to post  a happy birthday message to teams  and chat gbt starts framing the Adaptive  card Json for me  I'll go ahead and copy the Json code go  back to my flow and paste that code in  the Adaptive card Json  let's run this  and here is the Adaptive card that it  has posted  in writing Expressions related to  trigger conditions  trigger conditions allow us to trigger  our flows conditionally  Let's test it out  trigger condition formula for SharePoint  text column contains text  and it's gone ahead and given the exact  trigger condition for it  go ahead copy  go to my flow  go to the Trigger action go to settings  right here is trigger conditions I can  paste that in  in my case my text column is the title  column  title contains the text important  I'll click save  so I've added a couple of items one  contains the text important the other  one does not  based on the trigger condition that I  just added notice how my flow just ran  once  let's try another one  content type name is Project document  trigger a flow when a new folder is  created  if you enjoyed this video then do like  comment and subscribe to my YouTube  channel and thank you so much for  watching
