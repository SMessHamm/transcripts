meeting  and provide feedback the production and  quality teams then monitor the  production process for any problems this  is the process for releasing the new  clothing line in 2024 Lucy implements an  AI automation system the system proposes  suitable products based on Market  Research conducted by the strategy team  the design team selects and modifies the  best proposal from AI once the design is  confirmed AI chooses the materials to  meet business objectives and sets up the  production line  in 2025 the air animation system wasn't  rated it now performs market analysis  and proposes business goals the CEO and  Executives review the proposals and  determine the final goals based on the  results AI proposes products now Afters  products with nearly no flaws this is  due to the impact of the accumulated  database it builds the production line  and launches new products AI systems now  handle everything on their own providing  benefits to the company despite  occasional product releases not aligned  with human preferences we see you  occasionally provides feedback to the AI  system to address minor issues the  employees follow AI procedures and the  boss has little to do other companies  mostly adopt AI systems too no dramatic  profits but no operational problems who  now dominates this industry who is the  ruler of this land who holds sway over  Humanity's time  in 2016 Google's alphago and resettle  had a go game match most people thought  lissetto would win but it ended with  Google alphago's Victory with five wins  and four losses people thought that Aya  would bring many changes but there were  not many changes so far there have been  various AI services  like Google assistant Samsung Bixby  Apple Siri could understand human  language but only performed predefined  answers or functions people thought the  limit of A's performance was about this  level in December 2022 open ai's chat  GPT was released chat GPT doesn't have  predefined answers it understands  language and responds in a human-like  way based on the data it has learned the  potential of chat GPT is dependent on  the level of the user's question it can  answer questions in a wide range of  areas such as language translation  article summarization program code  generation writing vocabulary selection  educate philosophy history and most of  the areas we can think of it can also be  a guide a teacher or an assistant in  learning of course it is not perfect but  everyone will agree on its impressive  performance  it was believed that AI could not  replace jobs such as artists and writers  however a painting created using the  majority AI program won first place at  the 2022 Colorado State Fair art  competition  previously creativity was considered a  uniquely human trait however it is now  difficult to differentiate between a  painting made by a human or by eye what  is creativity well there's nothing truly  original Under the Sun just new  discoveries waiting to be made new  things are just what we previously  didn't know about the key to creativity  is finding new connections between  seemingly disparate elements even a new  character in a movie or play is just a  new arrangement of elements the writer  has seen before Music 2 is simply a  mixture of codes and Melodies that come  together in new and unexpected ways when  you really think about it what we  consider new is just a combination of  existing things seen in a new light to  put it simply creativity is all about  discovering something new trying a new  approach or seeing the world from a  fresh perspective unfortunately people  only see what they need to see they only  see what they want to see and interpret  things subjectively they don't perceive  or remember the outside world as it is  it's common for their memories to be  distorted on the other hand AI though it  can never be completely objective sees  data as it is the data remains unchanged  over time there is a huge difference in  the amount of data that AI can see  compared to what a human can see it  considers more cases of specific  patterns its systematic meticulous and  without any gaps who can see new things  more often between humans and AI who can  think of more combinations who can  create new things  what is taken away from humans by eye is  it the replacement of jobs that are  simple and repetitive it appears that  most of the jobs we think of such as  teachers programmers painters composers  will be replaced by eye the experience  of jobs disappearing is a problem that  has always been faced in the process of  civilizations progress and solutions  have always been found however this time  it seems different what AI offers to  humans is the answer while humans are  taking away is the process of starting  with the question and getting the answer  the necessity of studying the intuition  that comes from the accumulation of  trial and error and failure the pleasure  of Enlightenment a feeling of growth are  all taken away  until now studying was necessary for  life to be meaningful thinking to solve  problems was a given people who  experienced this reward become more  creative  this pleasure can only be obtained  through effort and achievement or  enlightenment  the pleasure obtained from addiction is  different  smartphones alcohol things and drugs are  things that provide rewards with little  or no effort continuing to maintain an  addictive State damages the human brain  causing a person to become one who does  not put effort into thinking worrying or  making wise judgments ultimately and  addiction are taking away from humans in  the same way there is recognition that  addiction is Bad Air is considered to be  a cool technology  the attitude towards the eye is  important humans must recognize that  they are using AI fortunately the  current generation has the intelligence  to use their  we our existence is capable of asking  questions to make better decisions the  problem lies with the Next Generation  the next generation will be in an era of  Temptation that they have not  experienced before in their learning  environment they won't need to think  about the homework they are given at  school air will show better results than  write their articles for them they will  become a first generation that does not  understand the necessity of study  foreign  T according to CNN it's due to the  potential for negative impact on  students learning and critically  thinking skills AI such as chat GPT may  have concerns about negatively affecting  the student's ability to learn and think  critically  the brain region most closely related to  studying is the prefrontal cortex the  prefrontal cortex has the ability to  endure for the future the ability to set  goals and self-inspect and the ability  to reflect on oneself in other words it  is the area that makes life more human  in the past the cola's brain filled its  skull however as coal is no longer have  to struggle and can hang on trees all  dating eucalyptus their brain size is  diminished the brain physically changes  depending on the environment what will  happen to people living in an  environment with a monotonous life a  lack of growth and plenty of fun to fill  the emptiness the callers have  degenerated and so have the animals the  brain of silicanthus become as small as  a beam  [Music]  civilization developed the wealth Gap  has increased over time a significant  cause of this Gap is the knowledge  divide currently the value of knowledge  is tied to the income generated from  Capital determining one's unseen status  in the future those who possess AI will  have a monopoly on all knowledge and the  next generation will not require  learning the knowledge Gap will only  widen at an even faster rate the film  idiocracy released in 2008 depicts  humanity and the future is foolish  chasing all these simple clashes this is  a more plausible outcome than vague  endings caused by natural disasters Wars  or viruses  [Music]  this is not about instilling fear and  Terror about a non-existent end of the  Future air will continue to evolve it  cannot be stopped and there is no reason  to stop it it will be used as a tool to  enhance the value of life  however advanced technology can be a  double-edged sword it helps facilitate  learning acquiring knowledge and solving  problems but if abused it can pose a  lethal threat to Human Rights and safety  the only way to prevent this threat is  through laws and regulations the state  should take responsibility while laws  dependent on a single state are  important Interstate Agreements are even  more so experts need to come together to  prepare systems to prevent abuse in  advance as individuals the only things  that can be done are to seriously  consider living a human life and to pay  attention to whether the society One  belongs to is creating a world that is  truly human  [Music]  foreign  [Music]
