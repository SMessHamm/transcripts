 over the last few days of my eyes new  chip gbt has been making headlines and  it's probably hard to overestimate how  much artificial intelligence is going to  change our lives and the economy so I  asked of my eyes chatbot whether the  recent developments of open AI represent  a threat to alphabets so Google's Core  Business Google search which as of  September 30th represents around 60  percent of alphabet's total revenue and  according to the chatbot open AI is not  a threat to search engines but honestly  I don't agree with the chat box response  and I do think that chatbots have the  potential to make Google search obsolete  so is of May Ice chatbot really going to  kill Google's core business or does  Google have some advantages too that may  help the business depend off some of the  new competitors this will be the topic  of today's video and so without further  Ado let's get started  foreign  [Applause]  is an area that is dominated by Google  search which runs around 99 000 search  queries per second which adds up to a  whopping 8.5 billion searches per day  which again represents a market share of  around 92 percent over the last nine  months of Google's 2022 fiscal year for  example the business generated 120  billion US dollars in Revenue just from  search but this business is possibly  about to be disrupted by a new  technology namely Ai and large language  models that can read summarize and  translate text and predict future words  in a sentence letting them generate  sentences similar to how humans talk and  write so let me just show you a couple  of examples that highlight why chatbots  like old May Ice chat GPT might actually  represent a very real threat to the  business Behemoth Google and yeah it's  Google search division for instance when  you ask the chatbot to create a detail  held one week travel plan to Paris for  someone who loves French food and who  wants to stay in a four-star hotel you  get the following response I think the  result is pretty damn impressive the is  no need to Google for restaurants no  need to Google for hotel suggestions and  the central pillars of your trip are  basically planned and this was done  within 5 seconds I then asked it can you  recommend a particular Cinema in Paris  and tell me how it can get there from my  hotel using public transportation  systems and again the results make  Google almost obsolete as I don't have  to filter through lots of different  links that may be provided by Google and  just get a very concise recommendation  by the openai chatbot instead and  although the chatbots results are not  always perfect and sometimes false  information is yeah presented with a  high degree of confidence by the bot  itself which also Bears its risks I  think improvements over time are  inevitable now personally I find the  chat GPT chatbot so useful that I  already asked my iPhone to create an app  for it that is now located on my phone's  home screen and I found myself use using  chat gbt instead of Google multiple  times a day already for instance I  recently had a debate with a friend  about the right amount of carbohydrates  per day and whether carbohydrates are  bad and instead of yeah Googling for  some arguments I just asked the chat GPT  to write a short scientific essay that  outlines why carbohydrates aren't as bad  as they are maybe sometimes yeah  presented as in the media especially for  young male athletes and I can think of  many more use cases ranging from yeah  quick tutorials for example how do I fix  a dripping shower head to more  conceptual requests why should I buy the  iPhone 14 instead of the iPhone 13 to  productive requests like writing or  fixing code or writing block entries on  topics X Y or Z so are we witnessing the  start of a rising competitive intensity  in search for the first time in the last  few decades basically arguably it is not  only the open AI that has the potential  to Dethrone Google no Microsoft the tech  Behemoth recently announced its  Ambitions to launch a so-called super  app that combines shopping messaging web  search news feed and other services in  one single app like WeChat in China now  I do have a couple of thoughts on the  threat that old may I in particular may  represent for Google that I want to  share with you today so I think to  understand why the open AI chatbot is a  threat to Google's Core Business first  of all you have to understand how Google  makes money on Google search  simply put I would say Google makes  money primarily through advertising and  more specifically performance-based  advertising at least for the most part  this means when people use Google to  search for something online the search  engine might display ads that are  related to the search term businesses  can actually Target specific locations  languages and audiences and they pay  Google to display the ads mostly on a  pay per click basis meaning businesses  only pay Google when someone actually  clicks on their ad  now the problem with a chatbot like chat  gbt is that there are no longer links  the quality of the answers of yeah the  chatbot is on average of higher quality  and more time efficient than yeah when  you Google something and then have to  yeah basically fight your way through  the various links that are provided by  Google and I think this creates a  problem because of course you could  argue that Google could just copy what  chat GPT does and integrate it into  their own Services just like Facebook  for example has copied features like  stories from Snapchat or similarly  Microsoft has been copying solutions  from competitors like yeah for instance  slack or Zoom for decades however if  there are no links there is no  monetization or maybe one can figure out  some form of monetization for search  results like the ones provided by a  chatbot but the monetization  possibilities may be less attractive now  if we do assume that the results of a  chatbot are harder to monetize this puts  Google in a difficult position and a  dilemma sure Google is already spending  billions on AI and its AI business  division deepmind has actually come up  with numerous programs that outperform  humans and games like go Starcraft or  Stratego for example and they even  solved a 50 year old protein folding  challenge moreover they are also into  autonomous driving with way more and and  their latest annual report they actually  outlined that they are exploring options  to make use of AI in search too quote  unquote we are currently experimenting  with multitask unified model  capabilities to make searching more  natural and intuitive and even enable  entirely new ways to search so maybe  based on their AI know-how copying the  functions of chat gbt may not be that  hard although to be honest I really  don't know I would assume that opme I  probably has a major Head Start in this  area but then again Google has access to  so much data that yeah this probably  them a slight Edge too but even if they  could copy it I think monetizing the  search results is harder than the Gap  traditional Google search business and  then Google would basically cannibalize  its own search business which as of now  as we've shown in the beginning of the  video represents the majority of their  profits and we do know that businesses  are often reluctant to innovate if yeah  this will kill their traditional Legacy  business and I think this is actually  expressed in the so-called innovators  dilemma which is a concept developed by  Harvard Business School Professor  Clayton Christensen and it refers to the  situation where a successful company is  facing a new market or yeah  technological challenges that resist to  change and continues to rely on its  established strategies and products even  as they become less effective because as  I just said this old strategy is  generating the majority of profits  so long story short Google has probably  more to lose than to gain here and even  though Google's valuation is already  somewhat depressed especially relative  to the Stock's history if the AI  disruption narrative gains traction  there's probably some downside with the  Stock's current valuation left now the  pull case on the other hand might be  that search results from a chatbot may  actually be monetized at an even better  rate because the chatbot could offer you  just the best paid option when looking  for a hotel in Paris for instance and  for the user it may be very hard to tell  that there is an ad in the first place  so in a way it could blur the  distinction between paid and non-paid  search results and this may actually be  a net positive with Google in in its  current form for example personally I  almost never click on the first Yeah  couple of results which are paid ads  yeah and so as I just said a chatbot  might actually be an positive when that  distinction between paid and yeah not  paid search results yet becomes more  blurry  now full disclaimer I own Google and I'm  not going to sell my Google Shares here  I think Google is a reasonably  Diversified business even though search  represents the majority of Google's  revenue but they also possess other  valuable businesses like Google Cloud  YouTube or Android to name just a couple  of examples what I'm going to do is I  will observe a situation very carefully  I will observe whether people form a new  habit here will they start chatboting  something instead of quickly Googling  something  now what's important to mention here is  that in 2010 and 2011 when Apple  launched Siri people also thought that  theory represented a major threat to  Google search around 10 years later we  know that Ziri couldn't really Dethrone  Google search so the habit formation  that is what I will actually obsessively  focus on from now going forward because  this so the habit of Googling may  actually be Google's strongest  competitive Advantage maybe chat GPT has  the potential to be better at yeah I  would call it a subset of search queries  and people will use it mainly for  knowledge based search queries while the  more valuable search queries in terms of  AD Revenue like when for example someone  is looking for a hotel for a specific  lawyer a fund manager or a mortgage  lender those search queries might might  still require a link and will therefore  remain on the Google search platform  alright to learn more about how chat GPT  may actually influence the world of  investing I recommend
