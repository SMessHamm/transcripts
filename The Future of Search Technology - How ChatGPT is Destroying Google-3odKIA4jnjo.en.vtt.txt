search engines and how it's even  outperforming Google in some ways from  building entire apps and websites to  causing developers to worry about Job  replacement chat gbt is Making Waves  don't miss this in-depth look at the  future of search technology chat GPT was  launched on November 30th 2022 by San  Francisco based open AI the creator of  Dali 2 and Whisper by December 4th  openai estimated chat GPT already had  over 1 million users taking the World by  storm and prompting Google's management  to issue a code red amid the rising  popularity of the chat GPT AI make sure  you like the video and subscribe to the  channel as we will discuss how chat GPT  can potentially Dethrone Google as a  world's first search engine and why  Chachi BT is better than Google in some  aspects is Google at risk of being  disrupted by AI the ancient art of  knowledge seeking has transformed  profoundly over the centuries from  relying on public libraries and  scholarly text for answers we have now  embraced search engines as a far more  efficient way to find Solutions in our  Digital World the search engine Giants  have seen a dramatic shift over the last  two decades with technological  advancement allowing Google to become an  all-powerful gatekeeper of information  once upon a time being Yahoo and ask  Jeeves were Kings of their respective  Thrones now they're only fondly  remembered as nostalgic footnotes in its  rise to domination for two decades  Google has maintained its place as the  Undisputed king of digital  interconnectivity boasting nearly 4  billion daily users and around 8 billion  search queries each day it's no surprise  that it's easily the world's most  frequent printed website as you know  Google is one of the most successful  companies in the world and a search  engine is a major part of that success  but now Google Faces A new challenge  chatbot technology that could disrupt  its traditional search engine business  this concept is known as The innovator's  Dilemma where successful companies are  reluctant to change their established  strategies and products even when they  become less effective we will explore  how chat Bots powered by artificial  intelligence may be able to blur the  lines between paid and non-paid search  results making it more difficult for  Google to monetize its services we'll  also look at how user habits such as  using a chat bot instead of quickly  Googling something can pose an even  greater threat to Google's business  model finally whittle's guess what  potential upside there might be for  Google if these new technologies do  prove disruptive namely better  monetization rates from chatbot driven  search results than from traditional  Google searches so let's dive in and  examine how Google could be challenges  from this new technology as of September  30th Google search represents around 60  of alphabet's total revenue but it's now  at risk of being disrupted by new  technology artificial intelligence and  large language models before we get  started so what exactly is chat GPT Chad  GPT is a language Savvy conversational  chatbot developed by openai using GPT  3.5 technology its ability to interact  and answer queries in a human-like ways  has made it nothing short of remarkable  almost as though real people are on the  other end the ability for language  models to predict the next word in a  series is set to become even more  accurate thanks to reinforcement  learning with human feedback or rlhf  this Advanced Training System combines  human feedback and machine learning  algorithms that enable chat gbt and  artificial intelligence based chatbot to  better understand instructions from  users while producing response chances  of satisfactory quality these models can  read summarize and translate text as  well as predict future words in a  sentence just like how humans talk and  write this creates a problem for Google  because it would mean that there are no  links to monetize through the search  engine Google could have more to lose  than gain if chatbots like open AIS  chatbot GPT make Google search obsolete  as it would cannibalize its own business  but the potential upside for Google is  that search results from chatbot may  actually be monetized at an even better  rate than traditional Google search  results giving Google an incentive to  embrace this technology as the world is  plunged into a sea of conversation about  open ai's revolutionary new chatbot GPT  service boasting over 1 million users in  its debut week few questions have been  left unanswered but amongst all  enthusiastic Acclaim surprised reactions  and even apocalyptic scenarios being  discussed there lies an underlying  concern at the heart can in this AI  technology dethroned Google from being  our go-to resource for online search  with popular chatter claiming that  Microsoft has heavily invested in  performance platform Azure with yearly  returns amounting to Millions it  certainly seems like some tech experts  think so consequently leading to Wild  speculation that at Merit bio proclaimed  openai just destroyed Google followed  swiftly by at JD Kelly declaring Google  is gone it appears not only are we in  the brink of a major shift within  technological history but also  potentially hearing Google declare their  own version of code red on this in a  desperate move to understand the  thoughts and intonations of human  language open eye has Unleashed gpt3 and  soon to be gpt4 two powerful neural  networks comprising over 100 trillion  neural network parameters at 175 billion  of them trained on vast amounts of tax  these massive machines are designed to  learn from vast amounts of Text data the  spoken dialogue as well as written words  ultimately attempting to string them  together in an ordinary fashion with  their own autocomplete system unhinged  by any ethical regulations though these  behemoths will not differentiate between  truth or credibility when conversing  instead only focusing on appearing  believable at whatever cost necessary  furthermore search engines are not  designed to be understood by humans but  rather to perform an algorithmic  operation using their own algorithms  they search the internet and select  relevant search results to display to  the user based on a variety of factors  such as sponsored links or search engine  marketing sem and optimization SEO  however current versions of chat gbt are  not designed for web searches it does  not crawl the internet nor has it been  trained on current information rendering  its results outdated recently John  Shulman of openai discussed web gbt and  updated version of chat gbt that would  be connected to search engine which  could potentially resolve this issue  however this is yet to be seen how can  you use chat GPT chatgpt is the rising  star of artificial authorship its  ability to write code poems compose  music and even craft short stories is a  designated author style offers an  unprecedented level of sophistication  for AI generated writing with its  Advanced capabilities to interpret and  follow even the most elaborate  instructions jgbt has evolved from a  mere source of information into an  invaluable educational assistant from  crafting essays on any given subject  matter to creating outlines for projects  of entire novels this technology offers  countless options for streamlining  research and writing processes in ways  that have never been seen before he here  is an example I tried and I was amazed  by the results I asked the chat gbt deal  is 10 things to do in Tokyo for 10 days  it was able to list out what to do each  day and I could just follow them and not  have to Google search and look through  multiple pages to find this information  so I think here's why the open AI  chatbot is a threat to Google's Core  Business this groundbreaking technology  is set to revolutionize the way we  interact with computers giving an  instantaneous solution for everyday  tasks it can now provide an answer in  written text no matter how difficult or  complex the query its potential  applications are almost Limitless and  could even impacts across virtually all  industry rates on a global scale first  of all understanding how Google makes  money is critical in today's world  primarily their profits come from  performance-based advertising when  people use the search engine to find  something else and related to those  terms appear on screen and businesses  pay a fee per click a cost incurred only  if someone clicks the ad it allows  advertisers great flexibility they can  Target certain areas where audiences  with Precision while remaining safe in  the knowledge that payment will be made  only for actual engagement with their  product or service Google is in a  precarious situation despite having  invested billions of dollars into Ai and  deepmind's record-breaking programs  there are no attractive money making  opportunities posed by chatbot results  this begs the question how can Google  capitalize on its massive investment  with an inability to monetize search  Bots they may be forced to find answers  outside of a carefully crafted  technological Arsenal this comes as  quite a shock due to deepmind's history  of stunning successes like solving 50  year old pro team folding challenges or  crouching humans at games such as go  Starcraft or Stratego as part of their  Innovative Endeavors they are pushing  the boundaries and autonomous driving in  searching their annual report  highlighted an effort to use AI for  search purposes with a focus on creating  more natural interactions along with  entirely new ways of conducting searches  that may even be similar to chatbots it  appears as though this company is  determined to discover cutting-edge  opportunities through artificial  intelligences so there's no doubt that  Google could face some challenge us  chatbot technology becomes more advanced  and popular but if Google can embrace  the potential of this technology and  leverage it to better monetize its  service then it could open up a world of  new opportunities for the company and  its customers alike now PJ CEO of Google  and his team are left anxiously awaiting  a chat gpt-like front end that utilizes  the mighty gpt4 is accessible through  Microsoft cloud and may be connected to  its search engine being although Google  has been a hard at work preparing their  own similar AI technology with teams  such as brain and deepmind leading the  charge law was revealed last year able  to essentially accomplish what Chad gbt  does plus more Blake Lemoine of Google  provided insight into just how realistic  the conversational machine could become  hinting it might even pose some sort of  cognitive abilities naturally Lambda  will come with built-in support for  services like Gmail docs Drive voice  assistant too the race for developing  artificial intelligence is on and it  appears that both openai and Google have  significant advantages in the  competition thank you for watching this  video about how
