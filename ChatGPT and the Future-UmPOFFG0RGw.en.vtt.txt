 foreign  all week I've been experimenting with a  tool called chat GPT  you've probably heard of this haven't  you it's an artificial intelligence chat  bot that takes natural language  instructions and can help users do all  kinds of things it'll write articles and  school papers and marketing materials  and business plans and and I asked it to  write two paragraphs on the Strategic  Genius of the Marshall Plan in the style  of Shakespeare  and it just spit it out  and by the way you can use it to write  computer code so people are already  using it to write stock trading programs  although something tells me that's  harder than it looks  anyway as I was experimenting with it I  have to confess that my reaction was  probably similar to a chimpanzee scene  fire for the first time which is  simultaneously fascinated and terrified  fascinated because it's kind of  mind-boggling to imagine all the ways a  person might use this technology but  it's also terrifying  partly because you can practically feel  the jobs evaporating I mean this kind of  tech is going to eliminate whole  categories of white-collar jobs I feel  like  and I was expressing this concern to my  colleague Chris looking for some  reassurance and he said look this is  going to open up gigantic new  possibilities that we we can't picture  you're underestimating people's  creativity  you know it took a hundred years after  the invention of the printing press  before they published the first  scientific journal but it only took a  year before they published the first  pornographic novel  so get people some credit  all right  [Music]  is it weird that that actually makes me  feel better
