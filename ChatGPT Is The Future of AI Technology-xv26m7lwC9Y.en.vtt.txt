 in this video we're introducing chat gbt  a language model trained by open AI or  conversational tasks it can understand  and respond to natural language and will  show you some of its potential uses stay  tuned chat gbt can't make you subscribe  you have to do it yourself so please  subscribe and enjoy the video but that  intro right there was made from chatgvt  chat gbt is an AI which is popping off  on the internet right now and as you can  see can do a lot of stuff so today we're  going to be going through a couple of  features and seeing what you can do  [Music]  write me an intro  for a YouTube video on chat DBT  okay  can you make it simpler question mark  hi there in this video we're good I  still think it's a bit long for this so  let me let me see uh can you make it  more upbeat can you make it a more oh  how do I how do I do this maybe can you  make [ __ ]  so I can say it in less than  hey there we go  oh  beautiful okay see uh you can see  already here it's created a YouTube  intro for me I asked for it to write me  an intro okay I said make it simpler and  then I asked for one that was 15 seconds  so I can get it out and fast  um for you guys  bro I editing this video right now and  like I put in the chatbot I'll make a 15  second intro  how long it took  it was 15 like 15 seconds on the top  that's crazy but I finished right there  that's when I finished that's crazy look  at the time oh my God that's insane let  me see  can you make me a a  a YouTube  YouTube thumbnail on chat DBT let's see  what it produces  that is completely fair I  I don't know why I try to ask the the  bot to make images but okay let's see  let's see let's see what uh it can do  what are your features let's see as a  language model my primary function is to  assist with natural language processing  tasks this includes understanding and  generating text as well as answering  questions and providing information when  possible I'm trained using a large data  set of text which allows me to  understand and respond to a wide range  of inputs I'm also constantly learning  and updating my knowledge based on the  latest available information however  please keep me in keep in mind that my  abilities are limited by my training and  the information available to me at the  time of your request my responses are  not always perfect and may not always be  accurate or up to date that's very cool  I like how it responds to you it's like  a like a conversation  um okay so I want to buy a new mic stand  mine's currently a bit fidgety so let's  see if it can give me some options and  you give me some options you give me  some options I want to make I want to  get uh microphone stand for my PC set  let's see  well I'm my mother to read all of it but  here it's explaining the different type  of stands I have to be more specific  with the stands can you give me some  specific boom microphone  stands  oh lee oh my God it gives you a  description of it as well that's crazy  so here this the three options that it  gives you it gives you little little  paragraphs on it that's really cool I  guess it's an easy Google search but  it's cool that you can do that into a  chatbot like Google and it gives you  these options in like a paragraph form  which makes it a bit easier for people I  guess like with with Google it gives you  a bunch of you know the the shop and all  the recommendations but this way because  your list and it's nicely gives you the  little descriptions and whatever cool  cool okay what else can we do  um because you know I'm trying to trying  to grow on YouTube right now so let me  see any any tips on YouTube's oh  actually I'll just say YouTube's  algorithm I'll go  Rhythm and let's see what it says  it's giving you a bunch of stuff I wanna  I wanna test this with Google actually  so let me any tips on YouTube's  algorithm well here's social Pilots it's  the first thing that comes up five tips  video description is the most underrated  weapon being consistent optimize your  title and thumbnail keep your audience  engaged relevancy is your weapon so a  bit different but in this way Google  doesn't actually tell it it gives you  the websites for YouTube videos  Etc this was from oh my gosh my voice  this is from 2021 not even 2022.  it was not updated but I assume I don't  know if this is updated either let me  let me ask uh see so one of their points  was let's say okay we'll go with the  first one use keywords in your titles  and descriptions what keywords are good  to use in YouTube titles what are the  phrases that are relevant to your  content and the people are likely to  search for on the platform here are a  few tips for choosing keywords don't  want to bore you too much but use  keywords that's that are specific to  your content use keywords that are  popular and relevant use long tail  keywords use keywords are descriptive  and informative you know what I'm gonna  write this down man this bot's teaching  me bro this is great at the bottom of  this one and this one like if I follow  these tips you can choose keywords that  are relevant popular and descriptive  which I help improve your visibility on  YouTube's algorithm wow that's really  cool well I want to go back to  thumbnails because I don't know why I  thought I could get a thumbnail from  this chatbot but any tips on YouTube  thumbnails okay I I'm bro I'm just  learning now the Bots just teaching me  stuff man  okay  so it says use high quality attention  grabbing images he's bold and easy to  read text use colors that contrast with  the background  use a consistent  a design makes sense and then it says  again by following these tips you can  create your thumbnails at attention  gambling informative and consistent  damn that is that is so sick that it can  give you stuff like this now now we'll  go through the more techy stuff I've  seen people say write songs like yeah  poems whatever write me a poem  about the  insanity of the human mind I don't know  why that came to my head but we'll go  for it giving us multiple paragraphs  let's see Insanity of the Mind a twisted  tangled web a never-ending maze that  leaves us feeling dead we try to make  sense of it all to unravel its Mysteries  but the more we try to understand the  more it confounds us with its  complexities  sometimes it seems like Madness the  thoughts that race within a jumble of  confusion that leaves us feeling thin  but still we search for meaning in the  chaos of our minds hoping to find some  clarity in the insanity we find  so let us embrace the madness and let it  lead the way but in the depths of our  confusion we may find a brighter day  how sick is that how sick is that oh my  God I don't know see I I I want to say  that this isn't copied right from the  internet so I wanna I wanna put it into  yeah sorry I want to put this into  Google to see if it comes up but I don't  think it is it made it up right like it  could be like copying it right like let  me get the first little four lines and  put it into Google nothing it doesn't  have anything so it's actually us like  it has keyword sure because like you  know eventually if you write stuff I  don't know something across like this  bro there's eight billion of us on the  planet so something might overlap but  clearly it's making it up which is sick  I also saw that it can do math problems  which is pretty cool I could get like a  integration question I guess but let me  go like a hundred factorial divided by  six but let me put this in Brackets  divide it by six by nine let's go  multiply over six nine oh  um yeah let's see let's see it gives you  an explanation as well oh I didn't do  the factorial let me see if it knows  yeah okay of course it's gonna know okay  maybe I  maybe yeah maybe dividing that by six  times that is dumb I don't know if you  guys care about maths but you can pause  it and read I I can ask for like an  essay because I saw a couple things on  the internet people are asking you know  it can write my essays or whatever so  let me ask chat chat gbt right me an  essay about about let me like climate  climate change let's see how long it is  because I ain't gonna read it because I  ain't bothered to read it but okay gives  you an introduction two paragraphs  there's evidence as well  I wish I had this in school man I could  have copy pasted this into like oh my  you know uh actually it wouldn't even  cut uh like be found on  um plagiarism chair because it's a bot  and made it up that's crazy so like you  can't even get checked out for it enough  about the school stuff to get back into  something else  um  I can ask about worldly stuff maybe like  what is  what is the current pop War watched  movie on Netflix let's even knows oh  okay so it says here I'm not able to  answer that question as a language model  trained by open AI I do not have access  to real-time information or the ability  to browse the internet my responses are  generated based on the input I receive  and the information I have been trained  on which is limited to a specific  knowledge domain I'm not able to provide  information on current events or popular  media as my knowledge is based on a  fixed data set and it's not updated in  real time cool okay I guess you can't  and like ask it for stuff which also  makes it even cooler because all the  stuff you ask it like the poem we did  before it's making an app on the spot  and not Googling it like you know that  it isn't just grabbing stuff off the  internet which is really really cool  um the database must be huge let's see  how big is  chat dbts  knowledge domain I guess uh like the  dial businesses so let's see how big  it's pausing that's the first time it's  paused  the exact size is difficult to determine  as it is constantly learning and  updating its knowledge based on the  inputs it receives in general large  language computer models like chat gbt  have a broad knowledge base that covers  a wide range of topics and can assist  with a variety of natural language  processing tasks however it is important  to keep in mind that their abilities are  limited by the information available to  them it may not always be accurate or up  to date  um I myself am not a tech wizard  but this type of stuff is insane the  fact that they can get AI to be so  conversational and  um I guess like make stuff up on the  spot or like use that database huge  database worth of uh information to  produce these answers is crazy  um  maybe let's let's make a conclusion  um  chat gbt  uh can you give me a  a summary  of your features  you know let's read it sure uh well I  said sure like it was follow the  conclusion as a large language model  trained by open AI my primary function  is to assist with natural language  processing tasks this includes  understanding and generating text  as well as answering questions and  providing information where when  possible I am trained using a large data  set of text which allows me to  understand and respond to a wide range  of inputs I am also constantly learning  and updating my knowledge base on the  latest available information however  please keep in mind that my abilities  are limited by my training and the  information available to me at the time  of your request  my responses are not always perfect and  may not always be accurate or up to date  wow very cool well that's my first  introduction to chat gbt let me give  like  I didn't even read the description I'm  gonna use it it says how it works and  some of the potential applications of  this technology I'm not doing that I'm  just going through the technology  because I think it's cool maybe I can  make a video next time  hmm I have to delete that pop-up  oh it gave me multiple video titles  I'll use one of those titles let's see  which one is the best well you'll find  you'll you'll you'll know what I think  is the best uh in the video  um hopefully you guys enjoy oh I've done  don't want to unlock the mic here um my  small little introduction to chat gbt  but we'll see where it goes hopefully  you guys enjoy Please Subscribe peace  have a good night even though it's  bloody why did I say that it's day it's  it's sunny outside but it's whatever man  peace  [Music]
